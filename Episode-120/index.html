Flying Solo </h2></a><ul><li><p>David was watching public cloud technologies evolve, and the company he was at wasn&rsquo;t too interested in that.  They were looking more at license assessments, and David wanted a more holistic approach. </p></li><li><p>Around this time he sought to do his own thing to explore various technologies and get back to the data lifecycle to help people  </p></li><li><p>David was traveling almost nonstop and needed more control over that. </p></li><li><p>He had made a name for himself in the SQL Server and VMware communities. </p></li><li><p>He had a strict noncompete from the previous consulting firm to deal with as well. </p></li><li><p>David hoped word of mouth from technical communities would bring him customers, and he received his first project on day 3 after stepping out on his own. </p></li><li><p>His business officially started September 1, 2013. </p></li><li><p>He had to fly to Denver to help this new customer solve their problem. </p></li><li><p>David advertised with blog posts, on LinkedIn, and on Twitter.  The connections he had made in the SQL Community really helped him be successful. </p></li><li><p>David would not wish owning a consulting firm on anyone who doesn&rsquo;t understand what it really takes. </p></li><li><p>There is a lot of sacrifice that comes along with it. </p></li><li><p>Being self-employed brings concerns about healthcare, difference in processes of getting loans, etc. </p></li><li><p>His family was supportive of the choice, but they set a deadline at which they would re-evaluate and pivot if needed. </p></li><li><p>They had a backup plan (money saved just in case). </p></li><li><p>The act of getting the business up and running was not cheap, but really good projects came in early to help stabilize things. </p></li><li><p>Everyone&rsquo;s perspective of going out on your own is different. </p></li><li><p>Some have customer lists and were moonlighting on the side. </p></li><li><p>David had a word of mouth reputation and a website.  He had money for startup, money for a decent burn rate, and a list of events to get the word out. </p></li><li><p>If you don&rsquo;t have a plan for making your first few sales, don&rsquo;t jump in until you are ready.  Listen to David&rsquo;s simple example of the timeline of quote to cash. </p></li><li><p>All kinds of legal contracts need to be written up, all of which are custom to the customer. </p></li><li><p>David understood several things from experience at the previous consulting firm.   </p></li><li><p>He found a very good lawyer to help in the beginning.   </p></li><li><p>But this does not remove the need to have contracts reviewed by legal teams of his customers and any changes that are required to do business with them. </p></li><li><p>On day 1, David had his hands in most everything.  His wife was kind enough to help with a lot of the back end items. </p></li></ul><a href=#1159---drawing-on-previous-experience><h2 id=1159---drawing-on-previous-experience><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>11:59 - Drawing on Previous Experience </h2></a><ul><li><p>David had done a lot of pre-Sales work before forming his own company and would often do some or all of the post-Sales implementation work. </p></li><li><p>What about being perceived as a Sales guy as owner of his own consulting firm? </p></li><li><p>David treats pre-Sales more as technical discussions.  Tell me what you think needs to be done, and let&rsquo;s brainstorm on what actually needs to be done.  </p></li><li><p>David approaches things as low pressure.  You either want his help or you don&rsquo;t.  He brings a set of candor to pre-Sales discussions.  Pre-Sales is the discovery of what is needed to complete the task. </p></li><li><p>This approach validates concerns that something is a problem. </p></li><li><p>Many times David has to tell people the problem is layers deeper than they think. </p></li><li><p>What about changing the company specialty based on market need? </p></li><li><p>Listen to how David turns a question into an explanation of how his company was named (Heraflux Technologies), which actually answers it perfectly. </p></li><li><p>The answer is…he does this constantly by staying on top of technology trends. </p></li><li><p>If you are in IT, you must continue to evolve and change with the technology. </p></li><li><p>David shares a story about a friend whose specialty was eliminated by technological change who was not able to adjust. </p></li><li><p>David is neck deep in the Microsoft Data Platform at present but also learning about cloud database instances. The NoSQL database concept with MongoDB and CosmosDB is quite fascinating for the right use case.  Listen to David&rsquo;s examples of how SQL Server could still be used in conjunction with these. </p></li><li><p>David likes to read up on what is going on in the industry, looking for new technologies that can solve business problems in new ways.  If he finds something useful he likes to conduct a 300-level hands-on overview before using for his customers. </p></li></ul><a href=#1927---advice-for-the-generalist-it-pro><h2 id=1927---advice-for-the-generalist-it-pro><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>19:27 - Advice for the #Generalist IT Pro </h2></a><ul><li><p>Your interests vs. what you do for your day job could be different things.  Hopefully those two line up. </p></li><li><p>David recommends thinking about what makes you smile and what you find cool.  Start reading up on those things. </p></li><li><p>A hobby today could become a day job / side project tomorrow. </p></li><li><p>If you find you enjoy it in tinkering, there&rsquo;s a high probability you will find out you really enjoy it once it becomes a full time job. </p></li><li><p>Nick makes the point that someone who enjoys blogging and presenting, for example, may like technical marketing as a career but may have less control over the content they cover than when it was a hobby. </p></li><li><p>How much of the day do I dread, and how much do I enjoy?  If the positives outweigh the negatives, stick with it. </p></li><li><p>If you hit a point where the negatives outweigh the positives, revisit the hobbies and the things you enjoy about that job.  Figure out if there is another role within the same company or at a different company that can get you back to what you really enjoy. </p></li><li><p>Many people don&rsquo;t want the change that comes along with looking for a new job.  </p></li><li><p>If you are unhappy in your job, the people around you can see it (peers, your boss, your family, etc.). </p></li><li><p>The blessing of COVID-19 is that it has proven many roles can be done remotely. </p></li><li><p>Even if you work somewhere with very few technical jobs in the area, COVID has opened the doors for you to look at larger companies without needing to relocate or step inside an office. </p></li><li><p>This also hurts people in the same town who might be looking for work, but it provides more options and directions for all of us.  David sees it as a good thing. </p></li><li><p>Companies offered work from home opportunities before COVID, but many were forced to enable this because of the pandemic.  Likely remote work becomes table stakes for an interview discussion. </p></li><li><p>David says many companies he worked with assumed people would work better if face to face in an office and that they would slack off if working from home. </p></li><li><p>Datacenters are not usually in the next room from us, even when we work in an office. </p></li><li><p>Before the pandemic David traveled 150 -
