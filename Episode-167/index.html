<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring rel=noopener>The Fellowship of the Ring</a> - too little butter scraped across too much toast.Â <a class="internal-link broken">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></p></li><li><p>You start to feel all the directions in which you&rsquo;re being pulled.Â  Can you reset the expectations or take a pause, step outside, and find the next thing?Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>The hardest thing is leaving people you care about.Â  It&rsquo;s a super hard decision.Â  You want to help the people you hired as much as you can, but ultimately we each are responsible for our own careers.Â </p></li><li><p>John says beware of personal contracts with people you hired (i.e. they came to a place to work for you specifically).Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Also, in this case, maybe you can look at the stressors and have some of them removed by management (which may or may not be possible).Â </p></li><li><p>Stepping back like this takes some character on a person&rsquo;s part.Â  And you have to set yourself up financially for these kinds of decisions.Â  Otherwise you don&rsquo;t have the flexibility to walk away.Â </p></li><li><p>Andrew members speaking to

<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kltownsend/ rel=noopener>Keith Townsend</a> and advises us to live below our means to provide financial flexibility.Â <a class="internal-link broken">Ken Hui</a> <a class="internal-link broken">Keith Townsend</a> <a class="internal-link broken">Personal Finance</a></p></li><li><p>Andrew went to a conservative Christian college and remembers a professor advising the class to build a fund for in the event their boss asked something they were not willing to do.Â </p></li><li><p>Imagine knowing that if you leave, you will be fine.Â  That gives you the ability to leave and doesn&rsquo;t require putting financial priorities on top of everything else.Â </p></li><li><p>Going back to leveraged compensation plan, live off the base to minimize stress.Â </p></li><li><p>We don&rsquo;t need to keep up with the Jones&rsquo;.Â  Financial security gives you options.Â  See also

<a href=https://www.purestorage.com/ rel=noopener>Pure Storage</a>, where Andrew works as of this recording, is an individual contributor role.Â  It&rsquo;s Director level but without direct reports.Â Â #PureStorage</p></li><li><p>You&rsquo;re working with customers, going deep in some areas, sharing vision and strategy, but also linked back to product teams and marketing (webinar presentation, feedback on future features, etc.).Â </p></li><li><p>This Principal Technologist role is part of the pre-sales organization.Â </p></li><li><p>Because the role is semi-defined, there is a certain day-to-day expectation.Â  But there is a high degree of latitude to fill gaps and help support positive change.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>He started as Principal Systems Engineer, but there was a little bit of a transition where this was a super SE role.Â  As Pure was continuing to grow, there was no way to be a super SE any longer.Â  Pure started to hire more overlays and added &ldquo;nerds who are allowed to talk,&rdquo; mixing business and technology.Â  The Principal Technologist is one such overlay.Â </p></li><li><p>Andrew also thinks about a 2x2 matrix for the semi-defined role as a way to determine where to put your time to make an impact.Â  On one side is micro and macro, and then you have reactive and proactive.Â </p></li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>Scope</th><th>Reactive</th><th>Proactive</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Micro</strong></td><td>Micro-Reactive</td><td>Micro-Proactive</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Macro</strong></td><td>Macro-Reactive</td><td>Macro-Proactive</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><p>Microreactive fills over time - this is servant leadership and getting pulled into help othersÂ </p></li><li><p>Macroreactive - you&rsquo;re getting pulled into bigger initiativesÂ </p></li><li><p>Microproactive is reaching out to SEs and peers, product management, and others seeking only to get to know others and build a relationship (not asking them for anything)Â </p></li><li><p>Macroproactive is the fun one (trying to help but on a wider scale).Â  You can use the microreactive experience as a data mining exercise to fuel the macroproactive.Â </p></li><li><p>For example, during COVID, Andrew was involved in the Pure Coffee Break series of webinars (one example of that can be found
<a href=https://www.purestorage.com/au/video/webinars/september-coffee-break/6290531384001.html rel=noopener>here</a>).Â </p></li><li><p>Keep the industry trends and solution focus relevant to customers, share what the field is seeing, and then dive deeper.Â </p></li><li><p>Andrew fundamentally likes where Pure is going as a company and wanted to keep some of his infrastructure roots.Â  With the acquisition of
<a href=https://portworx.com/ rel=noopener>Portworx</a> and release of other new products, Andrew feels the company will allow him to continue to grow and expand his skillset without falling behind in the industry.Â </p></li><li><p>Andrew says they did a survey on one of the most recent coffee break, and the one that came in highest was Pure&rsquo;s cloud strategy.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#2408---thoughts-on-the-principal-role><h2 id=2408---thoughts-on-the-principal-role><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>24:08 - Thoughts on the Principal RoleÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>This title varies between organizations.Â  The smaller the organization the more titles are free.Â </p></li><li><p>Principal is often the pinnacle or height of the individual contributor path.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Andrew maps to the East US Enterprise region (where he gets customer calls, etc.).Â  Then he also does projects that are more national and global in nature (webinar, feature contributions, filing patents, etc.).Â </p></li><li><p>Fun fact - Andrew has helped with 5 patent filings since being at Pure.Â </p></li><li><p>There is a sense that someone in this role is experienced and can bring value to a conversation with a customer without a &ldquo;look at me&rdquo; kind of attitude.Â </p></li><li><p>Nick mentions somoene in Andrew&rsquo;s role knows what good looks like.Â </p></li><li><p>You also need to understand people&rsquo;s motivations, how to navigate the organization you operate in, etc.Â </p></li><li><p>John says he needs to double down on reading
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Staff-Engineer-Leadership-beyond-management-ebook/dp/B08RMSHYGG rel=noopener>Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the Management Track</a> by <a class="internal-link broken">Will Larson</a>. <a class="internal-link broken">Staff Engineer</a>Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Folks in the Staff role are being looked upon more as leaders, to think strategically, and to be a force multiplier.Â  The book is slanted toward the software development career path but still quite valuable.Â </p></li><li><p>John feels this book has not been written for the pre-sales technical track.Â </p></li><li><p>Andrew got to meet
