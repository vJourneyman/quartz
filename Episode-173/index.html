<a href=https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/ rel=noopener>@NerdJourney</a>! We&rsquo;re
<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/ rel=noopener>John White</a> (

<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/ rel=noopener>Nick Korte</a> (
<a href=https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/ rel=noopener>@NetworkNerd_</a>), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we&rsquo;d been given earlier in our careers. In today&rsquo;s episode we share part 2 of an interview with Evan Oldford, discussing how to prioritize sleep, how to document your work, combatting perfectionism, and some insight on the genesis of Evan&rsquo;s book Ghost Rules. </p><p>Original Recording Date: 04-21-2022 </p><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/eoldford/ rel=noopener>Evan Oldford</a> is a Senior Director at Cisco Systems of an Escalations group.  His engineering team takes issues from support into engineering and they focus on restoring service for customers in the security domain.  Evan is also author of

Being able to set the boundaries between when you will be online and working and when you will be off can help. </p></li><li><p>There will be some tensions at times, but you can set the ground rules on where you will implement the boundaries.  You need to feel comfortable enough to be able to do this. </p></li><li><p>Of course, we need to be accessible for a large portion of our days, but the one thing you cannot compromise on is sleep. </p></li><li><p>Evan has sleep scheduled on his Outlook calendar.  Though he may not always go to bed right then, he sets the intention. </p></li><li><p>If you don&rsquo;t set the intention, your bedtime may be very irregular, which
<a href=https://thesleepdoctor.com/sleep-hygiene/sleeping-schedule/ rel=noopener>according to sleep psychologist Michael Breus can negatively affect health</a>.  Breus also wrote a very good book called
<a href=https://thepowerofwhen.com/ rel=noopener>The Power of When</a>. </p></li><li><p>Evan highly recommends reading
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316 rel=noopener>Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams</a> by Matthew Walker.   </p></li><li><p>It will make you want to go to bed (in a good way).  The author outlines a number of ways we sabotage our sleep. </p></li><li><p>What if it&rsquo;s time to go to sleep and you cannot shut your brain down? </p></li><li><p>Generally if you perform the shutdown routine we discussed earlier you don&rsquo;t get this feeling of rumination.  It&rsquo;s out of your head much like David Alan speaks to in
<a href=https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/ rel=noopener>Getting Things Done</a> and leads to some quiet. </p></li><li><p>When Evan&rsquo;s mind is racing on a topic, he finds it helpful to write things down to help stop the racing. </p></li><li><p>How can the extra sleep we got make up for work left unfinished? </p></li><li><p>Evan&rsquo;s task list inbox never goes to zero (much like most of us). </p></li><li><p>You have to embrace that the work will be there in the morning. </p></li><li><p>There are certainly deadlines where we need to press on and power through, for example.  But generally understand there will always be more work, and work generates more work. </p></li><li><p>We need to be able to hit pause and know the work will be there the next time we are ready to do it. </p></li><li><p>Sometimes Evan will intentionally work on a technical problem right before bed, knowing he cannot solve it.   </p></li><li><p>He has found that usually first thing in the morning he will have an insight / epiphany to help get past the road block. </p></li><li><p>This is subconscious deep work happening that isn&rsquo;t so different from the idea of embracing boredom to let your brain continue to think on a problem.  See also
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-4-embracing-boredom/ rel=noopener>Episode 144</a>. </p></li><li><p>Nick finds that the times he is fighting sleep the hardest to finish something are likely the times when he needs it most.  Pressing deadlines are of course an exception (some may argue even this could have been avoided with better planning). </p></li></ul><a href=#809---good-enough><h2 id=809---good-enough><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>8:09 - Good Enough </h2></a><ul><li><p>Something still being there tomorrow is in line with Evan&rsquo;s thoughts on work being &ldquo;good enough.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>Evan (and many others) has an inner perfectionist who needs to get everything just right.   </p></li><li><p>When you look at something you need to prioritize what is most important. </p></li><li><p>Typically in a highly dynamic environment you cannot do all the work on your to-do list to the standard of perfection. </p></li><li><p>You have to figure out if, for example, an 80% solution is good enough for a situation.  Some will keep polishing over and over when something is already good enough. </p></li><li><p>But stopping at good enough gives us more bandwidth.  There are certain projects where you need to go deep and have an extremely high level of precision (i.e. a higher priority task, for example). </p></li><li><p>For a task, ask yourself what is acceptable instead of whether it is perfect.  Acknowledge that it is not perfect.  Is it acceptable?  If so, lay it aside and get on to the next thing. </p></li><li><p>Evan has seen individuals get wrapped up in the perfectionism and end up operating on a smaller body of work. </p></li><li><p>Evan recommends
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Shipping-Creative-Work/dp/0593328973 rel=noopener>The Practice</a> by Seth Godin, which highlights the difference between good enough and perfectionism.  We want to be shipping our work. </p></li><li><p>We want to ship a good volume of work and to do this need to be able to hit pause on the inner critic and be ok with it.  This allows more bandwidth for focus on deeper and more important work. </p></li><li><p>Silencing the inner perfectionist is tough.   </p></li><li><p>Sometimes if Evan sees code that is not formatted correctly he needs to reformat it (not a great use of time). </p></li><li><p>Think about the result that needs to come from a task, and consider mentality the priority level. </p></li><li><p>Is this high priority, low priority, or just confetti work? </p></li><li><p>Step back and gain that perspective to help you decide how much effort is needed. </p></li></ul><a href=#1049---bandwidth-time-and-a-routine><h2 id=1049---bandwidth-time-and-a-routine><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>10:49 - Bandwidth, Time, and a Routine </h2></a><ul><li><p>There are many techniques on time management that can be utilized (like the Pomodoro Technique, for example) to divide up your time. </p></li><li><p>Check out
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Pomodoro-Technique-Acclaimed-Time-Management-Transformed/dp/1524760706 rel=noopener>The Pomodoro Technique: The Acclaimed Time-Management System That Has Transformed How We Work</a> by Francesco Cirillo </p></li><li><p>Bandwidth is more about what can be mentally accomplished during a block of time. </p></li><li><p>Think about what could be zapping your mental energy.  It could be a cognitive task.   </p></li><li><p>There is only a fixed about of energy per day, and you want to be able to exploit that bandwidth as much as possible. </p></li><li><p>One technique Evan highlights in the book is around a routine.   </p></li><li><p>Routines take time and mental energy. </p></li><li><p>Come up with a system that can short circuit this process a little bit and allow you to spend less mental calories making decisions. </p></li><li><p>A very marquee example is Steve Jobs and wearing black turtlenecks.  Jobs decided to spend his mental energy on creativity instead of what he would wear the next day. </p></li><li><p>This reminds Nick of a story about the cycling team in
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Excellence-Building-Fittest-Athletes/dp/1619617285 rel=noopener>Chasing Excellence</a> that utilized small improvements (or the aggregation of marginal gains) to destroy the competition. </p></li><li><p>Maybe Steve Jobs wasn&rsquo;t so crazy.  :) </p></li><li><p>Evan and his family use a meal calendar.  There is no need to ask what is for dinner when dinner time comes around because it has been pre-planned (including getting proper groceries).  It&rsquo;s all part of a routine. </p></li><li><p>Nick mentions having a special bedtime routine that he and his daughter do daily.   </p></li></ul><a href=#1318---how-to-document-your-work><h2 id=1318---how-to-document-your-work><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>13:18 - How to Document Your Work </h2></a><ul><li><p>Evan&rsquo;s book tells us not only what to do (document our work) but provides guidance on how to do it. </p></li><li><p>Evan created a worksheet (download a free copy of the format
