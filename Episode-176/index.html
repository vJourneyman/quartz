In today&rsquo;s episode we discuss John&rsquo;s experience becoming a parent, planning for and taking parental leave, lessons learned along the way, and the impact on his career. </p><p>Original Recording Date: 06-12-2022 </p><p>Topics – Context for the Show, Starting a #Family, Planning for #parental_leave , Communication and Preparing the Team, Return to Work, Lessons Learned and Parting Thoughts </p><p>=========================== </p><a href=#117---context-for-the-show><h2 id=117---context-for-the-show><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1:17 - Context for the Show </h2></a><ul><li><p>John and his wife welcomed daughter Keiko Vay White on March 29, 2022.  It&rsquo;s been a little overwhelming but overall a terrific thing. </p></li><li><p>John took some parental leave and this week will share the process of preparing for it, taking it, and returning from it. </p></li></ul><a href=#240---starting-a-family><h2 id=240---starting-a-family><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2:40 - Starting a Family </h2></a><ul><li><p>It&rsquo;s overwhelming and amazing to hold a baby in your arms and realize you are responsible for it for conceivable the rest of your life. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s been an exhausting, very gratifying, amazing experience that John would highly recommend (depending on your situation). </p></li><li><p>John realized back when he and his wife were discussing getting married his tolerance for financial risk was pretty low, feeling the need to be in a specific financial position before having a child. </p></li><li><p>This was more about risk mitigation than any specific amount of money being in the bank first. </p></li><li><p>John was able to work through these concerns after some help from a family therapist. </p></li><li><p>Some of this was based on the way John was raised and not having immediate family around for help with child care.  </p></li><li><p>Some risk was a result of having a child during a pandemic.    Even getting help with childcare from friends can introduce risk and expectations of certain behaviors that align to your level of comfort. </p></li><li><p>Nick mentions the implications of knowing a small human is 100% dependent on you and your spouse / partner for everything can be very humbling. </p></li><li><p>It helped John to understand what was scary about the scenario, considering a worst case and what he would be able to control if that happened. </p></li><li><p>After working through some worst case scenarios John understood that his fears were more about the unknown factors.  He came to understand that there were unknown factors for other life decisions he had already made (like his job change to Google) which seemed to work out well.  Think of it as analogous fear. </p></li></ul><a href=#747---planning-for-parental-leave><h2 id=747---planning-for-parental-leave><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>7:47 - Planning for <a href=/Parental-Leave rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Parental-Leave>Parental Leave</a> </h2></a><ul><li><p>Many people have a fear of parental leave.  What were some of the considerations for John and his wife? </p></li><li><p>Check out
