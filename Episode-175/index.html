In today&rsquo;s episode we share part 2 of an interview with Dominique Top, detailing her transition into a community advocate, experience as a meetup group leader, the road to HashiCorp, and how she has been making an impact since joining.   </p><p>Original Recording Date: 05-13-2022 </p><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominiquetop/ rel=noopener>Dominique Top</a> is a Solutions Engineer at

<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattstratton/ rel=noopener>Matt Stratton</a>, some of whom Nick recognized as
<a href=https://devopsloop.io/2021/agenda rel=noopener>DevLops Loop</a> participants in 2021. </p></li><li><p>These folks (and those like them) represent their company as a Developer Relations person. </p></li><li><p>For software companies, having someone act as a bridge between the company and the community is very beneficial. </p></li><li><p>Taking the example of
<a href=https://www.hashicorp.com/ rel=noopener>HashiCorp</a>, the developer advocates field questions from the community, participate in online forums, create interesting content sharing what can be done with HashiCorp&rsquo;s open source technologies, for example.  </p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.chef.io/ rel=noopener>Chef</a> as well as
<a href=https://www.vmware.com/ rel=noopener>VMware</a>,
<a href=https://www.aquasec.com/ rel=noopener>AquaSec</a>, and
<a href=https://snyk.io/ rel=noopener>Snyk</a> also have folks who perform this role, for example.   </p></li><li><p>Many of the people Dominique mentioned help organize
<a href=https://devopsdays.org/ rel=noopener>DevOpsDays</a> events.  </p></li><li><p>These roles may or may not fall under the Technical Marketing umbrella. </p></li><li><p>Dominique attended
<a href=https://developerrelations.com/devrelcon rel=noopener>DevRelCon</a> a couple of years ago.   </p></li><li><p>Developer relations is a bit of a new segment in the industry.  Some companies may have this role inside technical product marketing while others may have it in engineering. </p></li><li><p>It depends on what the company expects these people to do. </p></li><li><p>Sometimes it will be important for someone in this role to help hand off qualified leads (i.e. someone who started with open source and is looking for more enterprise solutions). </p></li><li><p>In other cases it may be about getting feedback from customers using existing products and helping to make them better. </p></li><li><p>Basically this is like a modern day
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard rel=noopener>bard</a> - giving talks to present interesting content (with demos) and making sure people want to engage. </p></li><li><p>The difference between what Dominique did at Tecknuovo and what she aspired to do at Babylon Health was being even moreso embedded in the technical communities, helping the community solve problems with solutions the company she worked for had to offer. </p></li><li><p>The difference between advocacy and developer relations is that developer relations takes things a bit further. </p></li></ul><a href=#942---the-meetup-group-leader><h2 id=942---the-meetup-group-leader><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>9:42 - The Meetup Group Leader </h2></a><ul><li><p>About 6 months into her Tecknuovo stint, the person leading the local Docker meetup group appeared to be a bit overburdened (was at the same time working on a startup). </p></li><li><p>Dominique asked how she could help.  Once she began to help her, the leader asked if she might like to just take over entirely.  She agreed. </p></li><li><p>Dominique likes organizing things and helping people.  It was fun to do this and become the group leader.  * There were a number of interesting talks which took place. </p></li><li><p>About 2 years after she took over the pandemic hit, which has not been great for in-person meetups. </p></li><li><p>Pre-pandemic attendance was 100-150 people at an in-person meeting. </p></li><li><p>Dominique was the main leader of the group after taking over (a volunteer position), but over time she delegated tasks to others.  </p></li><li><p>Her partner even helped out.  He works in a similar field to her, always solving problems. </p></li><li><p>Dominique&rsquo;s partner helped live stream a number of meetup events pre-pandemic and would make sure all the equipment was setup and ready to go.  Being a fixer, he was always willing to help. </p></li><li><p>Nick mentions his experience co-leading a community group and the responsibility to get sponsors, schedule, find a venue, get community speakers, and open up / close the meetings for the group (including sharing the meeting agenda, introducing speakers, and doing icebreakers). </p></li><li><p>Dominique says the meetup scene in London is huge.  There are so many who want to come and learn there wouldn&rsquo;t be time for everyone to share something to open a meeting.   </p></li><li><p>Dominique would normally have a couple of sponsors lined up for meetings.  Sponsors would get their company logo on the screen and have their company mentioned in the opening.  That did not necessarily mean the vendor gets a talking slot.  Usually the talk submission was a separate process (and anyone could submit something). </p></li><li><p>Dominique would prefer to give the community the priority, having 2-3 talks that filled an hour slot, break for food, have one more speaker after that, and then proceed to a pub for networking and further discussion. </p></li><li><p>The networking sessions were often the best part because they were a chance to get feedback on what worked and what did not.  Sometimes the vendor sponsors would also sponsor the networking session. </p></li><li><p>Dominique has kept these so they are sales free discussions, focusing on something that can be done with an open source tool.  She says folks in the community are often times not very open to something they will need to pay for unless this kind of topic is specifically requested. </p></li><li><p>When leading a meetup / user group, the importance of knowing your user base is paramount! </p></li><li><p>Like many others when around so many brilliant people, Dominique suffers from impostor syndrome, feeling it might be better to give others time on the stage. </p></li><li><p>She has presented at a number of conferences but due to the pandemic was not able to give a talk in this specific meetup group. </p></li><li><p>There&rsquo;s so much content available for those who might want to learn more about DevOps, making it somewhat overwhelming and hard to know where to start. </p></li><li><p>Platforms like
<a href=https://acloudguru.com/ rel=noopener>A Cloud Guru</a> or

She said yes.  This was back when she was a recruiter. </p></li><li><p>She was then asked why she might want to work for HashiCorp. </p></li><li><p>Dominique liked talking to technical people (lots of DevOps engineers, for example). </p></li><li><p>She had also been told by an engineer she met at a meetup group to remember the name
<a href=https://www.vaultproject.io/ rel=noopener>HashiCorp Vault</a> (which she did). </p></li><li><p>Throughout her recruitment career she has heard of Terraform and Vault on many occasions. </p></li><li><p>Dominique told Nico she wanted out of recruitment.  When he asked if solutions engineering might be of interest, she said yes but felt she did not have the proper technical skills. </p></li><li><p>It was suggested that Dominique get a certification (which she did with AWS), gain skills with Linux  (which she did through installing Linux and tinkering with it), and do some simple development (which Dominique has done through a small website she built). </p></li></ul><p> * Dominique likely knows more than she gives herself credit for knowing. </p><ul><li><p>About a year later, she ran into Nico again.  When he asked if she still wanted to come work for him (mentioning that he had open head count), she said yes. </p></li><li><p>It was a series of about 6 interviews in a week, including a technical exercise.  Dominique got the job as a solutions engineer at HashiCorp. </p></li><li><p>HashiCorp was the first startup Dominique joined in the technology space. </p></li><li><p>Tecknuovo, for example, considered itself a startup (but not in exactly the same space).  She was part of a 20-person company at that time. </p></li><li><p>When she joined HashiCorp they had over 900 employees.  It definitely had the startup vibe.  If you had an idea, you could make a pitch to someone and if approved give it a try. </p></li><li><p>Your day job consisted of certain things, but if you wanted to help in other areas you could. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s interesting and inspiring to see how everyone was working toward a single goal (get to IPO).  Dominique had never experienced something like this before joining. </p></li><li><p>They seem to have new people joining every day and at this point are over 2000 employees as of the time of this recording. </p></li><li><p>Picking a startup completely depends on what you might be looking for, but you can expect… </p></li><li><p>There is nothing as constant as change.  You can blink your eyes twice, and there is a new process. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s fairly fast paced, so it is important to protect a healthy work life balance. </p></li><li><p>Is the mission statement something you care about?   </p></li><li><p>Are the principles of the company aligned with your own values? </p></li><li><p>Are the written principles something the company actually believes? </p></li><li><p>Dominique believes HashiCorp does believe and that things done are viewed through these principles. </p></li><li><p>One of the principles at HashiCorp is kindness (full list with details can be found
