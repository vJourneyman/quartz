<a href=https://innovatisgroup.com/ rel=noopener>Innovatis Group</a>.  One of the largest clients is
<a href=https://www.vmug.com/about-vmug/what-is-vmug rel=noopener>VMware User Group (VMUG)</a> where Kate serves as the Senior Director of Program Management and Operations. <a class="internal-link broken">Kate Emshoff</a> #Innovatis #VMUG</p></li><li><p>Kate started on March 9, 2020 (which was about the time everything shut down because of the pandemic). </p></li><li><p>Her focus is more on execution of programs like
<a href=https://www.vmug.com/events2/vmug-usercon rel=noopener>UserCons</a>, and she has never attended a UserCon in person.  All of these are virtual at present. </p></li><li><p>Going into the pandemic, VMUG already a fairly robust virtual event platform, so it was not too difficult to change everything to virtual events. </p></li><li><p>VMUG hopes to begin having some in-person events in September of 2021. </p></li></ul><a href=#511---early-career-history><h2 id=511---early-career-history><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>5:11 - Early Career History </h2></a><ul><li><p>Kate attended Illinois State University studying communications and then focused on public relations and business administration. </p></li><li><p>Upon graduation she wasn&rsquo;t extremely clear about what she wanted to do. </p></li><li><p>But, she had the chance to study abroad in Salzburg, Austria and visit a number of countries in Europe. </p></li><li><p>Kate had to take out a loan to take the trip, but it was worth it, and the experience helped her realize she wanted to work in international business. </p></li><li><p>One of her first jobs was working for the Radiological Association of North America (RSNA). </p></li><li><p>The Marketing position where she started was more of an admin role. </p></li><li><p>Interestingly enough, every position Kate has taken in her career has been a role that previously did not exist at the company. </p></li><li><p>Kate was charged with marketing the company&rsquo;s scholarly journals to institutions like libraries and hospitals (where RSNA had been targeting individuals only). </p></li><li><p>This included negotiating licensing with universities and healthcare systems internally.  Every country has a different healthcare system. </p></li><li><p>Navigating these new waters for the company helped Kate elevate quickly.  She became a manager at a young age and was horrible at it. </p></li><li><p>As you elevate to management it&rsquo;s less about executing and more about being more intentional about growing, encouraging, coaching, and mentoring. </p></li><li><p>At one point she wanted to leave Chicago (had never lived anywhere else). </p></li><li><p>She accepted a job at The Royal Society in London after flying out there to interview, but it ended up not working out. </p></li><li><p>This was after she had given up her apartment lease and sold all her furniture! </p></li><li><p>She still wanted to live somewhere else and interview with a company that published content online. </p></li><li><p>After interviewing with one company, she called a friend who told her about a new opportunity in Marketing at his company (Silverchair). </p></li><li><p>Working for Silverchair was like working at a 20-year old startup, but it also prompted a move to Charlottesville, VA. </p></li><li><p>Kate met her future husband right before moving. </p></li><li><p>They maintained a long-distance relationship. </p></li><li><p>Charlottesville was a cool university town and a good experience.   </p></li><li><p>During this time Kate was able to get into the STEM field and worked with scientific, technical, and medical publishers. </p></li></ul><a href=#1330---fitting-into-a-new-group-of-peers><h2 id=1330---fitting-into-a-new-group-of-peers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>13:30 - Fitting into a New Group of Peers </h2></a><ul><li><p>Kate had the Marketing and PR background and worked with people who were editors by trade.  She was a bit of an outlier at the time. </p></li><li><p>Sometimes in your career you may lean toward places that make you feel comfortable, but it&rsquo;s important to embrace somewhere where you are uncomfortable or don&rsquo;t fit in with everyone else.  It can make you stand out. </p></li><li><p>The people Kate worked with loved talking about what they had learned and what they did in their field.     </p></li><li><p>You have to be ok with being vulnerable and asking questions of others, but it can&rsquo;t always be peppering them with questions. </p></li><li><p>Kate considers many of the people she worked with lifelong friends despite their differences from her. </p></li><li><p>Listen to Kate&rsquo;s story of being a young woman in her field and her willingness to point out arrogance in the Sales teams she worked with who wanted to sell to nonprofits. </p></li><li><p>She was willing to speak up when others might not have, and her co-workers took the feedback. </p></li><li><p>Nick stressed the importance of giving difficult feedback. He cited
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Feedback-Science-Receiving-Well/dp/0143127136 rel=noopener>Thanks for the Feedback</a> as mentioning sometimes the people who disagree with us the most may have the best feedback for us. <a class="internal-link broken">Thanks for the Feedback</a></p></li><li><p>Sometimes people might not know they are acting or presenting themselves in a certain way. </p></li></ul><a href=#1958---back-to-rsna-and-a-desire-for-more><h2 id=1958---back-to-rsna-and-a-desire-for-more><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>19:58 - Back to RSNA and a Desire for More </h2></a><ul><li><p>Kate was working from home in Chicago and not loving it.  She is an extrovert by nature. </p></li><li><p>The Executive Director at RSNA (a former employer) wanted her to have lunch to discuss a new department focused on International Affairs. </p></li><li><p>She had done licensing negotiations with people in other parts of the world, which really does require learning different cultures. </p></li><li><p>She would be starting from scratch, build a team, and create a committee to get this department off the ground. </p></li><li><p>Kate stayed there for 7 years. </p></li><li><p>During this time she got married and had 3 kids. </p></li><li><p>At some point she got bored and started looking for a new job.  She interviewed for a job while 9 months pregnant. </p></li><li><p>Many people in her life questioned what she was doing looking for a new job with small children.  She regrets listening to them. </p></li><li><p>You&rsquo;re going to be away from your family to some extent, so find something that interests you.  </p></li><li><p>There are not many examples of women with small children that are looking for a career change.  It’s like we have a societal norm that says it&rsquo;s not ok. </p></li><li><p>Many working women might say if they could work at McDonald&rsquo;s and make the same money, they would do it.  This is not the case for Kate.  It should be ok to say you want to pursue a career even if you have small children. </p></li><li><p>She tried to stick around at RSNA, but it came clear she needed more. </p></li></ul><a href=#2416---subtleties-for-women-in-interviewing><h2 id=2416---subtleties-for-women-in-interviewing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>24:16 - Subtleties for Women in Interviewing </h2></a><ul><li><p>There are things people might not realize are different for women when doing virtual interviews.  Kate received some advice from other women to do the following: </p></li><li><p>Removing pictures of children </p></li><li><p>Taking off your engagement ring so people don&rsquo;t perceive wealth and decide to pay you less </p></li><li><p>It is likely men and women alike might not know they are judging someone on these things. </p></li><li><p>There are some subtleties present even on virtual conference calls (i.e. Zoom or other). </p></li><li><p>Kate had to remind her husband to be mindful of giving the women on his calls an opportunity to talk.   </p></li><li><p>He dismissed it at first and then came back to Kate days later agreeing that this really is a problem.  Her husband said people were talking over the women constantly. </p></li><li><p>Maybe this stems from talking with those we feel comfortable with, and it&rsquo;s easy to forget you need to include someone else. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s important to be able to have open discussions where we admit our blind spots and try to learn together.  It&rsquo;s how we encourage change, but it&rsquo;s hard to have them and makes us uncomfortable. </p></li><li><p>Even after reading
