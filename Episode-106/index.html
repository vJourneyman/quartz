<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/ rel=noopener>Nick Korte</a> (
<a href=https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/ rel=noopener>@NetworkNerd_</a>), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we&rsquo;d been given earlier in our careers. Today&rsquo;s episode is the second in our three-episode discussion with
<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/usepowershell/ rel=noopener>Steven Murawski</a>, Principal Cloud Advocate at Microsoft. We dive deep into a discussion of Steven&rsquo;s philosophy and experience with learning new things by embracing being a beginner. </p><p>Original Recording Date: 11-17-2020 </p><p>Topics – The Beginner Mindset, Theory and Applied <a class="internal-link broken">Steven Murawski]</a></p><p>=========================== </p><a href=#246---the-birth-of-the-beginners-mindset-and-its-effects><h2 id=246---the-birth-of-the-beginners-mindset-and-its-effects><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2:46 - The Birth of the <a class="internal-link broken">Beginner&rsquo;s Mindset</a> and Its Effects </h2></a><ul><li><p>Despite Steven&rsquo;s role today, he continues to embrace this beginner mindset. </p></li><li><p>One of his current projects at Microsoft is to build up a DevSecOps open hack. </p></li><li><p>#DevSecOps is an area where he is very much a beginner.  Code scanning and penetration testing are new experiences, but this is opportunity for him to learn which is adjacent to other skills and experiences he has already built. </p></li><li><p>A willingness to be a beginner and ask the dumb questions has been an enabler for finding and moving forward in his career. </p></li><li><p>Being a beginner does not necessarily force someone into an entry level role.  You&rsquo;re bringing experience with you.  The totality of the experience and knowledge brought in by the individual can enable quick learning and the ability to integrate into a broader set of scenarios than if someone had started learning only one specific field with no additional experiences / skills. </p></li><li><p>There&rsquo;s a fear of being a beginner.  Hopefully a future employer and manager can see the total package brought to a new role that is the summation of past skills and experience. </p></li><li><p>Over time and looking over a broader scope, it could be changing companies, working from a different place, etc.  Look at and be willing to explore other options. </p></li><li><p>Steven has been fortunate that his wife has been extremely supportive of his extracurricular activities. </p></li><li><p>For example, he self-funded conference passes and travel to teach a class / give a talk.  He knew it was working toward something. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s easy to have an honest conversation about risk vs. reward and whether he should pursue it with his wife. </p></li><li><p>There is a difference between spending 30 years on 1 thing and spending 30 years doing 1 year worth of work on something. </p></li><li><p>Diving in deep in an area enables exposure to adjacencies and pick places to spread out.  If you haven&rsquo;t spent time branching out, you will have more difficulty. </p></li><li><p>Listen to Steven&rsquo;s examples. </p></li><li><p>There are very few things that have in return in terms of looking at that next thing / next skillset. </p></li><li><p>At the end of the day, there is not a lot of difference in the types of jobs Steven has had.  There are levels of things, but he still leverages things he learned back at the police department. </p></li><li><p>Nick makes the connection between this conversation and the premise of
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World-ebook/dp/B07H1ZYWTM rel=noopener>Range</a> by <a href=/David-Epstein rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/David-Epstein>David Epstein</a>. <a href=/Range rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Range>Range</a> </p></li><li><p>Be careful ascribing motive to situations where we can only see behaviors (i.e. someone in the same field for many years). </p></li><li><p>10:45 It&rsquo;s harder to make a change after doing something for 31 years than if you did it for 30 years.  It&rsquo;s never too late to start! </p></li><li><p>It is tough to argue against the current state.  We do not often evaluate the risk of staying where we are.  This is a challenge in having a DevOps conversation as well.  When exactly will the tipping point be for an organization? </p></li><li><p>John has heard the phrase that we underestimate our ability to see 6 months in the future and overestimate our ability to see 5 years into the future. </p></li><li><p>There will always be factors external to our organization&rsquo;s control.  Ask yourself what you are doing to put yourself in the best place for tomorrow. </p></li><li><p>A thought from
<a href=https://www.tmacsinc.com/ rel=noopener>Pat McNamara</a> If you were cloned today, could you tomorrow kick your clone&rsquo;s butt?  That is what you train for.  From a career standpoint, will you be more skilled and capable tomorrow than your clone from today? <a class="internal-link broken">Pat McNamara</a></p></li><li><p>Steven doesn&rsquo;t have to beat John or Nick out for a role or get more skilled than Kelsey Hightower or Donovan Brown.  But he does need to be better today than he was yesterday. </p></li><li><p><a href=https://nerd-journey.com/episode-018a-joseph-griffiths-interview-part-1/ rel=noopener>Joseph Griffiths</a> had mentioned one hour per day can help you accomplish just this. <a class="internal-link broken">Joseph Griffiths</a></p></li><li><p>There are no shortcuts. </p></li><li><p>Consider systems over goals.  Setup a system - a little code today, a little tomorrow, etc.   </p></li><li><p>Setting a goal to accomplish something in 6 months could lead to procrastination (i.e. a goal to write a C# program).  Listen to Steven&rsquo;s take on this, and consider &ldquo;what&rsquo;s good enough for today to make progress.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I need to be perfect tomorrow.  I need to be a little bit better than I was today.&rdquo; - Steven Murawski </p></li><li><p>John says Steven gets the full Nerd Journey bingo for his mantra of
