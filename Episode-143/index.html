Instead of trying to accomplish many things, try to accomplish a very few key things very, very well. </p><a href=#discipline-2-act-on-the-lead-measures><h4 id=discipline-2-act-on-the-lead-measures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures </h4></a><p>Important goals involving deep work often have trailing metrics (measurements of the outcome) that come too late to make changes. Instead, make sure to measure lead metrics, the behaviors that should lead to the success measured by the trailing metrics. (Conflict with the idea of the metrics black hole?) </p><p>For knowledge workers, the leading metric is clear: time spent doing deep work in pursuit of the identified goal. </p><p>  </p><a href=#discipline-3-keep-a-compelling-scoreboard><h4 id=discipline-3-keep-a-compelling-scoreboard><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard </h4></a><p>Measuring a behavior changes how you behave.

A weekly review which lasts a few minutes can help to draw attention to sagging or rising work metrics and figure out what is causing the good or bad effect (in order to enhance or correct it). </p><a href=#612-reactions><h3 id=612-reactions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>6:12 Reactions </h3></a><a href=#do-i-believe-this><h4 id=do-i-believe-this><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Do I believe this? </h4></a><ul><li><p>John: Yes. I’m wondering if I’m biased towards things that are asking me to make difficult choices and measure data.  </p></li><li><p>Nick: Yes.  It’s extremely hard to pick the things on which you will focus.  You start to think to yourself, “What if I pick something and want to change it later?”  Maybe it’s fear of limiting options more than anything.  Saying yes to the thing that “Arises terrifying longing” was an intriguing way to put it.  This goes back to personal brand / what you will be known for in a way. </p></li><li><p>John: I want to focus on doing Deep Work as a primary ability and the specific part of the business is secondary, since that will change over time.  What I will be working on will change from year to year.  Any specific direction will change periodically because of our industry. I don&rsquo;t want to limit what I am known for or what my options are.  Picking deep work keeps you from limiting options.  </p></li></ul><a href=#does-this-apply-to-me><h4 id=does-this-apply-to-me><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Does this apply to me? </h4></a><ul><li><p>John: Yes, measurement seems difficult, but it isn’t really. Measuring time spent is simple, especially if you decide ahead of time and put it on your calendar.  </p></li><li><p>Nick: Yes.  I’ve done a less than stellar job of measurement to this point.  Sometimes we think about an estimate of how long something will take (long project), but maybe we don’t think enough about whether it took as long as we thought or longer and why. </p></li><li><p>John: This reminded me of intensity of focus, perhaps recording that level as well as the time spent. Recording lead measures has been something I haven&rsquo;t really done. </p></li></ul><a href=#does-it-make-me-want-to-change-behavior><h4 id=does-it-make-me-want-to-change-behavior><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Does it make me want to change behavior? </h4></a><ul><li><p>John: Definitely.

<a href=https://timeflip.io/ rel=noopener>timeflip</a>, as recommended by Don Jones (see
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/apprentice-amplifier-and-people-developer-with-don-jones-2-2/ rel=noopener>Episode 138</a> for how Don uses it). I am going to start recording a daily work diary recording hours spent in deep work. Use a timer, not my calendar, to keep me honest. I need to add in the end-of-week cadence, almost like a weekly shutdown cadence. Measure time in deep work and start making adjustments based on what I see.  #TimeFlip <a href=/Don-Jones rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Don-Jones>Don Jones</a> <a href=/Episode-138 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Episode-138>Episode 138</a></p></li><li><p>Nick: I feel like I’ve been tracking the high level goals but not how long I have spent working toward them. What if I&rsquo;ve spent zero time on a project?  Is it actually something I am focused on doing? </p></li><li><p>John: Cal Newport mentions in his podcast,
<a href=https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/ rel=noopener>Deep Questions</a>, that sometimes procrastination is a subconscious way of the brain telling us it&rsquo;s not important or doesn&rsquo;t have concrete enough next steps.  I started listening to the podcast from the beginning and am making my way through the episode library. <a href=/Deep-Questions rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Deep-Questions>Deep Questions</a></p></li></ul><a href=#1812-be-lazy><h3 id=1812-be-lazy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>18:12 Be Lazy </h3></a><p>&ldquo;Laziness&rdquo; is really an emphasis on the division between work and relaxation. In order to fully commit to work, one needs to also fully commit to stopping work and relaxing.   </p><p>  </p><a href=#reason-1-downtime-aids-insights><h4 id=reason-1-downtime-aids-insights><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights </h4></a><p>Work that involves synthesizing lots of ambiguous and even conflicting information with many potential solutions is aided by the additional neuronal bandwidth which the unconscious mind has to bring to bear on a task. Thus, giving oneself a habit or ritual of ending the work day and allowing the unconscious mind time to go over one&rsquo;s work can be very helpful. </p><a href=#reason-2-downtime-helps-recharge-the-energy-needed-to-work-deeply><h4 id=reason-2-downtime-helps-recharge-the-energy-needed-to-work-deeply><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply </h4></a><p>Attention Restoration Theory claims that spending time in nature can help improve one&rsquo;s ability to concentrate later. Psychologists studying it call concentration &ldquo;directed attention&rdquo; and say that it&rsquo;s a finite resource. If it&rsquo;s used up, it can lead to &ldquo;attention fatigue.&rdquo; This is similar to the idea of limited willpower to do deep work or inhibiting attention on distractions. Restoring attention heavily depends on not revisiting work at all (full attention on spending time in nature, for example). Knowledge workers can at least start this process by fully putting down work when they finish for the day. </p><a href=#reason-3-the-work-that-evening-downtime-replaces-is-usually-not-that-important><h4 id=reason-3-the-work-that-evening-downtime-replaces-is-usually-not-that-important><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important </h4></a><p>In “The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance,” <a href=/Anders-Ericsson rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Anders-Ericsson>Anders Ericsson</a> writes that novices can&rsquo;t perform &ldquo;cognitively demanding work&rdquo; for more than an hour a day, while experts can only rarely do more than four. Recognizing this leads us to protect the time that we do spend on deep work but also that just adding hours to the end of the day is rarely productive. </p><p>  </p><a href=#2144-shutdown-ritual><h3 id=2144-shutdown-ritual><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>21:44 Shutdown Ritual </h3></a><p>Ensure you have a plan to act on every incomplete project that you have, in a place you’ll find it. This removes the cognitive overhead of wondering if you’re forgetting anything. </p><p>Saying the shutdown phrase, “Shutdown complete” was an interesting tactic. This might seem silly, but is a minor point compared to actually recording your state on all your projects. It&rsquo;s probably a way of using the auditory part of your brain to also understand that the work day is over.  </p><p>  </p><a href=#2406-reactions><h3 id=2406-reactions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>24:06 Reactions </h3></a><a href=#do-i-believe-this-1><h4 id=do-i-believe-this-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Do I believe this? </h4></a><ul><li><p>John: Yes, ever since I read

<a href=https://www.amazon.com/YOUR-BRAIN-WORK-REVISED-UPDATED/dp/0063076063 rel=noopener>David Rock&rsquo;s reference</a> to only being able to remember 7 things.  There is cognitive overhead in trying to remember things.  Being able to walk away seems to important. </p></li><li><p>Nick: I know I’ve reached the point of diminishing returns where I thought “I could work on this longer, but it’s doing me no good and isn’t my best work.  I need some kind of break.”  Doing deep work toward the end of your day is possible, but you have to assess whether you have the energy. </p></li><li><p>John: This reminds me of Pat Gelsinger&rsquo;s idea of putting everything away to get home, realizing he might need to work between 9 PM and bedtime, and reserving time exclusively for relaxation and family. </p></li></ul><a href=#does-this-apply-to-me-1><h4 id=does-this-apply-to-me-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Does this apply to me? </h4></a><ul><li><p>John: Yes. I&rsquo;m trying to work on things but am still striving for improvement. I also like Attention Restoration Theory and going into nature. </p></li><li><p>Nick: Yes.  I struggle to put things down at the end of the day pretty often.  What I have been doing to help is keeping a log of the things that should be worked on the next day / ideas for solutions to problems.  Sometimes these aha moments come in the evening after I’ve stopped working for a little while.   </p></li></ul><a href=#does-it-make-me-want-to-change-behavior-1><h4 id=does-it-make-me-want-to-change-behavior-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Does it make me want to change behavior? </h4></a><a href=#what-will-i-change-to-align-myself-with-this-idea-1><h4 id=what-will-i-change-to-align-myself-with-this-idea-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What will I change to align myself with this idea? </h4></a><ul><li><p>John: Yes. Have a way to deal with ideas that pop into our heads from the unconscious mind. That was the whole goal. Capture for future work periods. Make sure I’m actually walking away from work and recording my state in every project in order to truly put it down. I’ll start scheduling a block at the end of each day to do that. Keep a place to record random thoughts to follow up on if something comes to mind outside of working hours.   </p></li><li><p>Nick: This frees you up to be present with your family. It’s one thing to free the mind / get the work out so you can rest, but I think I could do a better job organizing those things in general once I’ve let them go for the day.  I like the idea of turning work off and not allowing yourself to dig back into it if you’ve shut down.  Even not checking e-mail from the time I get up until I start work could help. </p></li><li><p>John: It&rsquo;s fair to take a moment to record thoughts that we have during relaxation time so that we don&rsquo;t spend any energy trying to remember it. How about checking work e-mail? I turned off alert (all push notifications). I haven&rsquo;t done it with chats on my phone. I need to investigate how to make chat notifications only show up during work hours. And that&rsquo;s different from suppressing the urge to check work emails and chats. </p></li></ul><a href=#summary-thoughts-on-rule-1-work-deeply><h3 id=summary-thoughts-on-rule-1-work-deeply><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary thoughts on Rule #1: Work Deeply </h3></a><ul><li><p>John: Practical? Yes. Thought provoking. Actionable. </p></li><li><p>Nick: There are many things here to consider and will take some practice to master. Take the example of checking email at the start of the work day, not first thing in the morning. Checking might make me try to remember the reactions I have to that email instead of being fully present. I need to remember to try to make small, incremental changes, not big ones.  There&rsquo;s a boundary setting discipline here too. </p></li><li><p>John: Great point. Even 2 hours a day of calendared deep work has been tough to be 100% on. This underlined the idea that you have to train your brain to be in that state and only allow thinking about a single thing. </p></li><li><p>Nick: This is like a hard core diet for your mental game. </p></li></ul><h2 id=contact-ushttpstwittercomnerdjourney-if-youve-read-deep-work-and-have-reactions-you-think-we-missed-wed-like-to-hear-from-you-or-if-you-have-other-books-youd-recommend-or-if-youneed-help-on-the-journey><a href=https://twitter.com/NerdJourney rel=noopener>Contact us</a> if you&rsquo;ve read Deep Work and have reactions you think we missed, we&rsquo;d like to hear from you.
