In today&rsquo;s episode we share part 1 of our interview with Eric Brooker, covering topics such as getting into sales, accepting others&rsquo; no, and progression into sales leadership.   </p><p>Original Recording Date: 7-20-2021 </p><p>Topics – Getting into #Sales, When No Means No, Performance Issues and Doing the Right Things, Sales as an Element of Many Areas, Individual Contributor to Leader, Interaction up the Leadership Chain <a href=/Eric-Brooker rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Eric-Brooker>Eric Brooker</a> #BigleafNetworks</p><p>=========================== </p><h2 id=202---meet-eric-brookerhttpswwwlinkedincominericbrooker>2:02 - Meet
<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericbrooker/ rel=noopener>Eric Brooker</a> </h2><ul><li><p>Eric and his wife have 7 children and live near St. Paul Minnesota.  Eric has been in tech sales / tech sales leadership for about 21 years and currently works for Bigleaf Networks.  </p></li><li><p>Eric says he currently works with some of the best people he&rsquo;s ever worked with in all his years. </p></li></ul><a href=#325---getting-into-sales><h2 id=325---getting-into-sales><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3:25 - Getting into Sales </h2></a><ul><li><p>Eric has interviewed a number of people going into the sales profession. </p></li><li><p>If you can get past the 4 letter word that is sales and be comfortable in your own skin, there is a lot of upside. </p></li><li><p>When Eric was 20 and his wife was pregnant with their first child, it was all about the money and a chance to make a financial advancement in his career. </p></li><li><p>Eric had not finished college, and it was time to &ldquo;grow up.&rdquo;  He had a plan for his wife to stay at home, and in order to do that, there were sacrifices needed. </p></li><li><p>Stepping into sales was kind of in his blood with his parents both owning their own business. </p></li><li><p>He found himself successful with the support of a number of great sales leaders who told him what to do and how to do it.  Eric learned if he would do what they told him to do, he was going to be successful. </p></li><li><p>Eric eventually grew into a sales leader himself, wanting to give back see others succeed as he did. </p></li><li><p>For Eric, the idea of sitting back at a retail facility and waiting for someone to come to him was not what he wanted.  He wanted to go out and get the business. </p></li><li><p>Very early in his career, this meant door-to-door sales.  In order to build trust with businesses, you have to do it. </p></li><li><p>One Monday he would have conversations and collect business cards followed by making calls on Tuesday, trying to earn that next customer. </p></li><li><p>This was not easy because Eric was young.  So many of his friends were out partying. </p></li><li><p>Eric stayed motivated by that vision of his wife staying at home with the kids, which she has been able to do for his entire career in sales. </p></li><li><p>Sales is not for the week at heart. </p></li><li><p>Month after month there are sales goals and objectives.  You can knock it out of the park in June, and then July 1st hits, forcing you to do it all over again. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s a lot of work, and it&rsquo;s a lot of fun when it&rsquo;s rewarding.   </p></li><li><p>Eric has seen many people succeed over the years, which brings him joy just the same. </p></li><li><p>Are there certain personality types better suited for sales? </p></li><li><p>Some of this is a learned behavior.  No one really likes rejection. </p></li><li><p>Eric has the ability to just &ldquo;move on&rdquo; after getting a no despite wanting a yes.  He has rarely if ever taken it personally. </p></li><li><p>No one has ever not done business with Eric Brooker because they didn&rsquo;t like him as a person.  It was that they did not need his product or service or were unable to make a change at the time. </p></li><li><p>You&rsquo;re going to get no&rsquo;s as a salesperson. </p></li><li><p>The extrovert may find success a little easier. </p></li><li><p>When people ask Eric how he does what he does, Eric says he feels he is not doing anything different than just being himself. </p></li><li><p>An introvert can be as successful as an extrovert and must be able to handle rejection. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s possible the introvert who is more detail oriented may be better suited for the complex sale.   </p></li><li><p>Eric has found a niche that works well for him from a sales and sales leadership perspective. </p></li><li><p>Eric feels like anyone can to anything they want if they truly set their mind to it. </p></li><li><p>For Eric, growing professionally has been about reading a lot of books. </p></li><li><p>If you&rsquo;re not a salesperson by nature, go pick up some books, and give it a whirl.   </p></li><li><p>As of this recording, we are living through
<a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonwingard/2021/09/02/the-great-resignation-why-gen-z-is-leaving-the-workforce-in-drovesand-what-to-do-about-it/ rel=noopener>the great resignation</a>.  Many are working from home and realizing they no longer like what they do and are looking to get into something different. <a href=/Great-Resignation rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Great-Resignation>Great Resignation</a></p></li><li><p>Try something new.  Now is the time.  Everyone out there is looking to do something different. </p></li><li><p>Nick and Eric talk about loving Audible.  Nick cannot listen on faster than 1.0.  Eric says he&rsquo;s usually at 1.6 or 1.7, stopping to take notes here and there. </p></li><li><p>One of the best sales books Eric has read is
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/ProActive-Selling-Control-Process-Sale/dp/0814407641 rel=noopener>Proactive Selling</a> by <a class="internal-link broken">Skip Miller</a>.  <a class="internal-link broken">Proactive Selling</a></p><ul><li><p>It covers a lot of the basics like how to leave a voicemail, how to get someone to help you, how to get someone to return your call / e-mail. </p></li><li><p>Eric was forced to read it in 2012 and eventually met Skip Miller in 2013. </p></li><li><p>Another good one by Skip is

Know what is going on in people&rsquo;s lives. </p></li><li><p>Listen to Eric&rsquo;s story of his boss&rsquo;s empathy toward him after losing a family member (i.e. caring well for your employees). </p></li><li><p>Sales in large part is an activity game.  It&rsquo;s a matter of doing enough activity to get enough results and figuring out what that activity is each and every month, quarter, year to hit and exceed goals. </p></li><li><p>Eric shares a story from when he thought he was on the brink of being fired, but his boss actually told him he was doing all the right things, knowing that the results would come. </p></li><li><p>Eric mentioned this happened because his boss took the time to get to know him and understood what he was going through. </p></li><li><p>This reminds John of <a href=/Annie-Duke rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Annie-Duke>Annie Duke</a>&rsquo;s book
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-in-Bets-Annie-Duke-audiobook/dp/B078SBSBW3 rel=noopener>Thinking in Bets</a>. <a href=/Thinking-in-Bets rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Thinking-in-Bets>Thinking in Bets</a></p></li><li><p>Control the activities within your control (number of calls you make, etc.), and focus on the right activities. </p></li><li><p>There is some chance involved as there are things outside of our control.  But by controlling the things you can control the tide will eventually turn in your favor. </p></li><li><p>Maybe we see sales as more outcome / results oriented than other professions because the metrics are easily shown? </p></li><li><p>If you&rsquo;re a developer, you should have deadlines for others to see whether you are meeting the deadliness. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s similar in customer service.  There are certain metrics involved. </p></li><li><p>Sales is the one that often times generates the bulk of the revenue of the company.  When sales are down, everyone notices. </p></li><li><p>Eric thinks everyone&rsquo;s job needs to be managed in a similar fashion. He&rsquo;d love to see a customer service scoreboard or a development scoreboard and whether we hit the last metrics. </p></li><li><p>In sales we get a lot of visibility, but in any job, success and failure are 100% measurable. </p></li><li><p>Dollars are extremely measurable, and other metrics may be more difficult to come by / seem more ephemeral. </p></li></ul><a href=#2402---sales-as-an-element-of-many-areas><h2 id=2402---sales-as-an-element-of-many-areas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>24:02 - Sales as an Element of Many Areas </h2></a><ul><li><p>This reminds John of the movie
