Making Yourself Known in the Management Chain </h2></a><ul><li><p>Instead of Brad telling an employee what his boss might think, he asks the employee what they want their skip level to think. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s a great way to help someone figure out where their gaps might be. </p></li><li><p>John speaks to the idea of mapping out an organization and understanding what is important to the person in each role.  This works well to expose gaps and is a good exercise for anyone to become more relevant. </p></li></ul><a href=#531---differences-in-the-interview-process-for-managers><h2 id=531---differences-in-the-interview-process-for-managers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>5:31 - Differences in the Interview Process for Managers </h2></a><ul><li><p>The first management job Brad interviewed for was his dream job.  He was devastated when he didn&rsquo;t get it. </p></li><li><p>The strategy for treating interviewing like you would a certification test did not evolve until later in Brad&rsquo;s career. </p></li><li><p>It developed quickly when he saw the gaps. </p></li><li><p>If you&rsquo;re an individual contributor, the next dream job will likely come up sooner as there are more individual contributor jobs than manager jobs. </p></li><li><p>In the lens of gaining experience interviewing, don&rsquo;t pick a bunch of jobs at the company you really want to work for to use as training.  Likely you won&rsquo;t get many more interviews at a company after saying no to them multiple times. </p></li><li><p>Nick floats the idea of asking others who are managers to mock interview you for a manager role. </p></li><li><p>Brad has helped set this up for someone on his team right now who has shown interest.  The person is interviewing with Brad&rsquo;s boss and some other leaders to gain experience. </p></li><li><p>It seems like people in higher places are willing to offer time to help develop talent within the organization. </p></li></ul><a href=#1025---transitioning-to-a-new-manager><h2 id=1025---transitioning-to-a-new-manager><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>10:25 - Transitioning to a New Manager </h2></a><ul><li><p>Brad has changed managers twice in the last year.   </p></li><li><p>As an individual contributor, he had 4 bosses in 4 years.  In 5 years as a manager, he&rsquo;s had 5 bosses. </p></li><li><p>If your manager is changing, it could be a sign that the company is growing.   </p></li><li><p>Brad found a way to turn this into a good thing.  </p></li><li><p>He likes to treat this change the same way he would want a new direct report to treat it. </p></li><li><p>What do you want to do, what are you good at, and how do you like to be communicated with? </p></li><li><p>One of the first questions Brad asks is about how the person likes to be communicated with? </p></li><li><p>Some people expect video on for virtual conferencing, for example. </p></li><li><p>This is a good ice breaker and shows the manager that the employee is trying to make it easy for the manager to adapt. </p></li><li><p>The faster the relationship can be productive, the better it is for everyone. </p></li><li><p>A change in manager is a good time to not be so humble.  Talk about some of the good things you have done so the boss knows you&rsquo;re confident. </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;A confident SE is a good SE.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>This helps the manager understand what you&rsquo;re good at and the type of work you really like to do. </p></li><li><p>Take the opportunity to set the stage instead of waiting for it to be set for you. </p></li></ul><a href=#1629---layers-of-transitions-in-brads-move-to-globals><h2 id=1629---layers-of-transitions-in-brads-move-to-globals><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>16:29 - Layers of Transitions in Brad&rsquo;s Move to Globals </h2></a><ul><li><p>Brad gives a shout out to his former manager, Yvette Edwards, for all the support when he wanted to pursue the change. </p></li><li><p>He&rsquo;s been lucky enough to have that type of experience every time he has wanted to make a change. </p></li><li><p>It was very hard for Brad to leave his existing team.  Without the support of his manager at the time, it would have been even more difficult. </p></li><li><p>Good managers are going to encourage your career mobility…even if it causes the manager short-term pain. </p></li><li><p>Listen to the best advice Brad has ever received from a manager and the story surrounding it. </p></li><li><p>Brad realized the team was not going to collapse if he left.  It created an opportunity for someone else. </p></li><li><p>Brad learned when he first started in management that he needed to trust and have confidence in the people who picked him that his skillset was right for the job.   </p></li><li><p>People management is just solving problems, which is what we do as engineers. </p></li><li><p>Assess the current state, figure out what the future state needs to be, and put together a plan to get to future state.  That is the way Brad tackled the move, and he is continuing to execute on the plan…even with current circumstances around COVID. </p></li><li><p>Stay the course, lead the team, and celebrate the wins (even small ones). </p></li><li><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a big transition because Brad just tried to fix the problems.   </p></li><li><p>Brad took over management of a team of people he didn&rsquo;t know / had not managed during the time of COVID. </p></li><li><p>He&rsquo;s tried to prioritize 1-1s with video on each time. </p></li><li><p>This team of people Brad is managing was newly formed (taken from other teams to create a new team).  The people on his team didn&rsquo;t even know each other in the beginning. </p></li><li><p>Brad had to focus on team collaboration / team building than his collaboration with the team.  He had an incorrect assessment of current state in the early stages and had to modify the plan.  </p></li><li><p>To add to the challenges Brad was presented, his new team happens to be spread across the United States (people in Pacific, Central, and Eastern time zones). </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s been important for Brad to start his day at 7 AM and not end until 7 PM to be involved, support the team, and build relationships. </p></li><li><p>Before our interview, Brad was on a call that did not end until 7 PM Central. </p></li><li><p>John comments on getting used to consistent camera-on meetings when making a move to Google. </p></li><li><p>Building new teams, growing teams, and taking over troubled teams are likely all experiences a manager would want to have as part of their career. </p></li><li><p>John speaks to handling greenfield accounts at Google instead of accounts who were already customers like at VMware.   </p></li><li><p>Brad mentions the relatable experience that can help here (take a tool used before and tweak it for the situation). </p></li><li><p>John mentions letting go of being perfect, and Nick chimes in with an experience along those lines. </p></li><li><p>Brad also had to adapt to being on a new team of peers. </p></li><li><p>He was new to a group of peers (which was also a new team that was forming). </p></li><li><p>Brad&rsquo;s boss was also new to managing the team Brad transitioned to in Globals. </p></li><li><p>Brad needed to balance being new and sharing previous experiences with his teammates. </p></li><li><p>The dynamic of the team was a little different, and Brad had to adapt quickly.  </p></li><li><p>Brad knew a few of his teammates (at least somewhat) before making the move to this new team. </p></li></ul><a href=#3928---the-difficulty-in-the-decision><h2 id=3928---the-difficulty-in-the-decision><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>39:28 - The Difficulty in the Decision </h2></a><ul><li><p>If you don&rsquo;t acknowledge some fears and doubts in making a move like this, you are lying to yourself. </p></li><li><p>Brad was not afraid of whether he could do the job and felt like he understood the expectations. </p></li><li><p>Will what you learned in the hiring process hold up after you make the change? </p></li><li><p>Sometimes a mismatch here can impact success in a major way. </p></li><li><p>Brad felt the change would inspire a renewed energy and help build his brand.  This outweighed the fear of the unknown. </p></li><li><p>The emotion of leaving a team that he built was even more difficult than the fear of the unknown. </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;I love these folks.  I love this team.  That was what held me back.&rdquo;   </p></li><li><p>You cannot always allow this to prevent making a decision to further your career, and Brad wasn&rsquo;t really leaving those people behind (still at same company). </p></li><li><p>Closing thoughts: </p></li><li><p>Decide what you want to do, make sure people know about it, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to be bold in figuring out what to do. </p></li><li><p>Go with your gut, and go for what you want. </p></li></ul><h2 id=contact-ushttpstwittercomnerdjourney-if-you-need-help-on-the-journey><a href=https://twitter.com/NerdJourney rel=noopener>Contact us</a> if you need help on the journey.</h2></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/Episode-147/ data-ctx="Episode 84" data-src=/Episode-147 class=internal-link>Episode 147</a></li><li><a href=/Episode-87/ data-ctx="Episode 84" data-src=/Episode-87 class=internal-link>Episode 87</a></li><li><a href=/MOC-Communicating-With-Your-Management/ data-ctx="Episode 84" data-src=/MOC-Communicating-With-Your-Management class=internal-link>MOC -
