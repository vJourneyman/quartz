<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-David-Allen-audiobook/dp/B00005V7Q4 rel=noopener>Getting Things Done</a> by <a class="internal-link broken">David Allen</a>. <a class="internal-link broken">Getting Things Done</a> </p></li><li><p>If you have not updated your resume in years, it is extremely stressful when applying for a new job.  Follow a system, and as part of it update the resume consistently. </p></li><li><p>Many people may not apply for a job because it&rsquo;s too much work. </p></li><li><p>When you finish a cool project, write it down and track it in some kind of system (like Evernote, for example).  Make this part of every Friday&rsquo;s routine.  Take screenshots, etc.  Save that stuff, and updating your resume is easy. </p></li><li><p>You need to be planning for your next job NOW! </p></li><li><p>You can&rsquo;t rely on a company as a safety net.  You&rsquo;re not going to get a watch in 20 years like it used to be. </p></li><li><p>Brad gives the example of his dad working for Eastman Kodak and getting laid off at one point.  He did not have a plan of what would be next. </p></li><li><p>Have an exit strategy, and be thinking about what is next on the ladder for you, even if not management. </p></li><li><p>Firing someone is incredibly hard to do.  Not everyone is meant to have that. </p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t think that the next step needs to be manager. </p></li><li><p>Consider the project manager role and other options in the industry. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s not the company that will be your safety net but the people you develop relationships with over time. </p></li><li><p>Remember to also ask your network what you can be doing for them to keep the connections warm (i.e. don&rsquo;t make every contact you asking for something). </p></li><li><p>Constantly pay things forward.  Brad&rsquo;s current role was the genesis of raising his hand at that VMUG years ago. </p></li><li><p>Find ways to directly give back to others, the community, etc. </p></li><li><p>In-person training is Brad&rsquo;s biggest problem with COVID. The best thing you can do when the pandemic is over is to train in person. </p></li><li><p>Brad remembers getting energy from experiences with training and listening to people talk about their experience, share ideas, etc.   </p></li><li><p>He cites the NSX Ninja program as something extremely beneficial also. </p></li><li><p>Hearing the best in the world teach networking helped him finally get it. </p></li></ul><a href=#2323---finding-the-right-talent><h2 id=2323---finding-the-right-talent><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>23:23 - Finding the Right Talent </h2></a><ul><li><p>Finding the right talent for his team was way harder than Brad anticipated. </p></li><li><p>He had been a leader before but did not have control over who got hired (seemed to happen at a level higher than him).  Normally he was the technical interviewer. </p></li><li><p>If someone does not know the tech, Brad doesn&rsquo;t really care.  If they have experience as a customer and can share that experience, it will be helpful in the role. </p></li><li><p>Brad has managed SEs who specialized in Networking and Security as well as HCI (i.e. vSAN, Cloud Foundation). </p></li><li><p>As soon as someone gets into a role like this, there is a ton of training. </p></li><li><p>There are things which cannot be taught - getting along with others, for example. </p></li><li><p>One test is to ask yourself if you would want to be in a car with the person for 3 hours. </p></li><li><p>Diversity and inclusion is hard as well.   </p></li><li><p>Finding female engineers is challenging, and the process has to be different. </p></li><li><p>Guys will lie about their accomplishments and exaggerate skills, while ladies won&rsquo;t do that. </p></li><li><p>Some may see a list of requirements in a job description and decide not to apply based on them.    </p></li><li><p>There are way too many dudes in our industry. </p></li><li><p>John mentioned it is now more culturally acceptable for women to be nerds. </p></li><li><p>Sometimes you have to dig for the nerds.  Brad likes to ask what people nerd out on in their spare time.  He reads a great deal in his spare time. </p></li><li><p>Dig for what people are passionate about in the interview, and learn about what makes them a good fit for the role. </p></li><li><p>Brad wants to help the person in the interview relax and feel at ease.  And in his conversations with people he is trying to sell them on the role. </p></li><li><p>A good manager will stay in touch with people who made it deep in the process but did not get the role. </p></li><li><p>Little things like sending a thank you note are helpful.  Connect with the hiring manager on LinkedIn. </p></li><li><p>Not getting a job in one instance doesn&rsquo;t mean you are out of the running forever. </p></li><li><p>At VMware there are panel interviews.  The process goes like this - discussion with HR, discussion with the manager, and then the panel process. </p></li><li><p>Remote interviews are a challenge and require a presentation.  Brad encourages presenters to choose a topic other than the technology. </p></li><li><p>How do you mitigate risk in hires? </p></li><li><p>Some of this is tied to the segment where you work (in Sales, at least).  Each has a unique challenge.  Brad is in the commercial segment (the mid-market). </p></li><li><p>Maybe you are new, inexperienced, and want to make the jump.  If you have the experience it may take you a while to train to standards, but as long as you have the social skills and are a nice person, Brad will take that chance. </p></li><li><p>Try different companies, different segments, and look at Value Added Resellers. </p></li><li><p>Brad learned a ton about how the business works from someone at Sigma. </p></li><li><p>The real risk is managing customer outages. </p></li><li><p>Work at all different sizes of companies to gain experience. </p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t give up after one try. </p></li><li><p>Brad says he has a hard time finding people to hire.  Not enough people will apply, and many may self-select out of the process due to lack of confidence. </p></li><li><p>Brad gives the example of a recent hire he made where the person was not an expert at NSX and gives an example of his employee&rsquo;s expertise in other areas of the VMware portfolio. </p></li><li><p>Brad explains why he took a chance on this particular person. </p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t send more than 1 page on a resume. </p></li><li><p>Brad shares what he looks for on resumes during the hiring process. </p></li><li><p>Job hopping does not look good. </p></li><li><p>There are so many resumes that there is little time to spend too much time on each one. </p></li><li><p>Keep in mind HR filters resumes based on key words.  You need to get through that to get to a hiring manager. </p></li><li><p>Make sure the resume says who you are and what makes you stand out. </p></li><li><p>Show enthusiasm about the job if you talk to the hiring manager.  The hiring manager is a human who wants you to be excited about the company. </p></li><li><p>Ask questions during the interview! </p></li><li><p>If you show you are worried about the culture, you are most likely a fit. </p></li><li><p>There are genuinely nice people at companies. </p></li><li><p>Ask questions about who your teammates will be. </p></li><li><p>One of the hardest things for leaders right now is building a high performing team when no one gets together in person. </p></li><li><p>Brad is managing a team of people who for the most part have never met each other and expecting them to be a cohesive team. </p></li><li><p>Don’t hesitate to bring your experience on teams in the past (sports, military, etc.)? </p></li></ul><a href=#4052---parting-thoughts><h2 id=4052---parting-thoughts><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>40:52 -
