He eventually decided not to be afraid to mess up and make mistakes because he knows it will happen.Â  Too much pressure before one of these conversations doesn&rsquo;t help.Â  Nick wants to define success in terms of something he can control rather than the outcomes.Â Â </p></li><li><p>John mentioned having to do research on what C-level folks care about and how important it was to know this going into the conversation.Â  It&rsquo;s not really products.Â </p></li><li><p>Seeking to understand is a great approach.Â </p></li><li><p>What has it been like to experience the growth and change at VMware over these years?Â </p></li><li><p>Some products are now SaaS and on-premises.Â  Despite the same features, they have different license models.Â  You have to know which one will be better for the customer.Â  Each product is a wealth of information.Â </p></li><li><p>The experience of getting educated in each area is like spinning plates.Â  It can be challenging to stay up to date in all areas.Â </p></li><li><p>Nick has probably studied up more than needed in certain cases.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>John mentioned finding the right level of depth is difficult.Â </p></li><li><p>Some of the learning came from finding the answers to questions from customers (out of necessity).Â  These can also be good opportunities to learn a customer&rsquo;s business better.Â </p></li><li><p>What about the philosophy of training and balancing the internal skills training with external interests?Â </p></li><li><p>Nick points this out as an opportunity for improvement.Â  There is still a quarterly week of enablement.Â </p></li><li><p>There are live trainings and recorded trainings, some optional and some required.Â  Customer facing activities are the priority.Â </p></li><li><p>The balance is hard to keep.Â </p></li><li><p>What about interaction with the larger account team?Â </p></li><li><p>Think of Nick as the technical quarterback of the account.Â  He works with other internal groups and pulls them in at the right time and for the right purpose.Â </p></li><li><p>This requires some kind of synchronization meeting with the specialist teams.Â </p></li><li><p>You try to make the right call for engaging these specialists.Â </p></li><li><p>Nick thinks of it like thisâ€¦Â </p></li><li><p>Do the right thing for the customer.Â </p></li><li><p>Be helpful to internal teammates.Â  One way to do that is getting them involved to help when valuable to the customer, the account team, and the specialists themselves.Â </p></li><li><p>Many customers don&rsquo;t often realize how big their account team is.Â </p></li><li><p>How has the business of technology influence been for Nick?Â </p></li><li><p>Some of it comes from exploring the VMware tech and using it himself.Â  Nick has, for example, shared his explorations with Azure Functions and Tanzu Observability with customers.Â </p></li><li><p>Having a body of work to support what you&rsquo;re talking about helps provide credibility.Â </p></li><li><p>Influence can also come from pushing people forward in their career.Â  This can come from helping others build skills and encouraging them to share with the greater community.Â </p></li><li><p>Nick initially had some discomfort in being perceived as being in a Sales role as opposed to being looked at as a technologist.Â  How has that gone?Â </p></li><li><p>Nick tries to operate with integrity in all circumstances.Â </p></li><li><p>As John has stated previously, the Solution Engineering organization does sit within a greater Sales organization but is separate.Â </p></li><li><p>Nick has to be concerned about whether the technology will solve the problem the customer has, if it will work, if the right version and licenses were selected, etc.Â </p></li><li><p>Part of this is a due diligence to the company and the customer.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Being a truth teller is important.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#2850---culture-check-in><h2 id=2850---culture-check-in><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>28:50 - Culture Check-InÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>How has the change in teams, managers, and segments helped Nick&rsquo;s career?Â </p></li><li><p>He likes to learn how others do the job, how they interact with their customers, how they interact with others internally, etc.Â </p></li><li><p>Aggregating the bright spots / what is working for others can be adapted to your own style so you&rsquo;re still you.Â </p></li><li><p>These changes have helped build a support network of peers who are willing to help.Â </p></li><li><p>Big time collaborations have often get kicked off by sharing with teammates and getting to know one another on a personal level.Â </p></li><li><p>Nick shares the story of a teammate who vetted an idea he had for VMworld that was eventually accepted.Â </p></li><li><p>What about manager changes specifically?Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s good to get those different perspective from leaders and hear what they believe is important.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>The coaching methodology has remained the same from management.Â  You just have to get used to the manager&rsquo;s style, the metrics they want to collect, how involved they want to be, etc.Â  Adapting to someone else helps you grow.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#3251---reflections-from-before-vmware><h2 id=3251---reflections-from-before-vmware><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>32:51 -
