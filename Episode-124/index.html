<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Practice-System-Network-Administration-Admin-ebook/dp/B004JLMUJ0 rel=noopener>The Practice of System and Network Administration</a> and
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Time-Management-System-Administrators-Working-ebook/dp/B0026OR2WM rel=noopener>Time Management for Systems Administrators</a>. <a class="internal-link broken">The Practice of System and Network Administration</a> <a class="internal-link broken">Time Management for Systems Administrators</a></p></li><li><p>Tom understood deep work and that engineers need time to focus. </p></li><li><p>It was impressive to see Tom&rsquo;s command line knowledge in action.  As a manager he was extremely technically savvy. </p></li><li><p>Josh is now moderately competent in
<a href=https://github.com/vim/vim rel=noopener>vim / vi</a>. </p></li><li><p>As part of Stack Overflow, Josh no longer had to be a DevOps advocate.  It was built into the organization.   On Mondays he would join a stand up with the development team. </p></li><li><p>Josh had a front seat and insight into what software features were going to be released and why.  In other organizations, it might have taken years to even know the application&rsquo;s name. </p></li><li><p>Working for Tom was amazing, and it was a fantastic, extremely talented team. </p></li><li><p>Josh had been a user of the
<a href=https://stackoverflow.com/ rel=noopener>Stack Overflow</a> platform but not much of a contributor before joining the company. </p></li><li><p>The people at the very top are still people, and they make mistakes.  Everyone on the team was extremely respectful and humble, being receptive to the ideas of anyone at any level. </p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t hold people in high positions up on a pedestal because you can attain that as well. </p></li></ul><a href=#636---writing-a-book><h2 id=636---writing-a-book><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>6:36 - Writing a Book </h2></a><ul><li><p>Josh wrote
<a href=https://becomeansible.com/ rel=noopener>Become Ansible</a> before joining Stack Overflow. <a class="internal-link broken">Become Ansible</a></p></li><li><p>At the time he had no other outlet.  Pluralsight did not have room in their catalog for Ansible content at the time. </p></li><li><p>Previous to this, Josh experienced some health issues.  After recovering from them he did not dive back into community right away. </p></li><li><p>There was a two year period where he was dark from a community standpoint and dedicated himself to his job. </p></li><li><p>Josh had acquired a wealth of knowledge in bringing Ansible into a large organization that was mostly Windows.  There were some struggles to onboard the technology, and it did not seem like there was something in the market that captured this experience. </p></li><li><p>Josh felt like he needed to get the knowledge out of his head, and he had always wanted to write a book. </p></li><li><p>After speaking to others who had written a book and struggled to get it published, Josh listened to a great episode of the
<a href=https://www.writerontheside.com/ rel=noopener>Writer on the Side Podcast</a> in which someone left Amazon to write their own book and self-publish. </p></li><li><p>That gave Josh the idea to self-publish. </p></li><li><p>Josh likes to publicly commit to goals to help hold himself accountable, and writing the book is one he followed through with. </p></li><li><p>Before starting to write he had a rough outline of some of the chapters. </p></li><li><p>To keep yourself on track when writing a book, begin with the end in mind, but you don&rsquo;t begin at the end. </p></li><li><p>Originally Josh had 8 chapters outlined and kept wanting to append as he wrote.  He eventually broke the book into two parts, outlined part 1 aggressively, and just started writing. </p></li><li><p>The time commitment was 1-3 hours per day (average of 1.5 hours daily, whatever he could squeeze in) for 6 months to finish the book (143 pages in total). </p></li><li><p>Josh continued writing after finishing the book and hit a streak of writing for over 240 consecutive days. </p></li><li><p>Josh loved the writing process and was extremely frustrated on many days.  Listen to the two extremes Josh uses to illustrate how it felt during the process. </p></li><li><p>It took about 20 pages to get past impostor syndrome.  And the amount of pre-sales dollars he made blew him away. </p></li><li><p>Near the end of the process, Josh had to make a hard choice to cut some chapters out of the book. </p></li><li><p>There were days when Josh would sit in front of his computer and start at a blank page, writing nothing because he was not sure how to say what he wanted to say. </p></li><li><p>Josh&rsquo;s writing process was singular to a large degree - outlining, writing, editing, and proofreading. </p></li><li><p>Josh is working to break these processes out now that he is in a full time writing position, realizing each requires a different type of attention.  This will allow him to scale. </p></li><li><p>This would allow different manuscripts to be in different phases concurrently because of the difference in mental power. </p></li><li><p>Josh&rsquo;s tag line for the book is written by an engineer for engineers…it&rsquo;s like shoulder surfing a co-worker. </p></li><li><p>Josh has plans to do a book update for a newer version of Ansible (to be released next year). </p></li><li><p>Josh&rsquo;s mentor gave him some advice on writing a book.  &ldquo;You write the book for you.&rdquo;  If it&rsquo;s the book you wish existed but does not, you should pursue it. </p></li><li><p>If you&rsquo;re doing it for the money or for the notoriety, it is going to be tough because of the lack of intrinsic motivation. </p></li><li><p>Writing a book for the technology industry can be a challenge. </p></li><li><p>If you are focused on bleeding edge technology, writing a book will be more challenging because of how quickly things change. </p></li><li><p>There is still some room to create more evergreen content.  Josh shares an example of something he did with his Ansible book. </p></li><li><p>Make sure the problem the book is solving is not just learning the technology (i.e. only a reference manual) but that it focuses on how the technology will benefit the reader. </p></li></ul><a href=#1606---setting-a-course-for-microsoft><h2 id=1606---setting-a-course-for-microsoft><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>16:06 - Setting a Course for Microsoft </h2></a><ul><li><p>When Josh joined Stack Overflow, he released a blog called
<a href=https://duffney.io/building-a-new-identity/ rel=noopener>Building a New Identity</a> and mentioned there was &ldquo;evidence of a writer&rdquo; within.  </p></li><li><p>During the previous year, Josh took Don Jones&rsquo; Be the Master workshop to help take back his career. </p></li><li><p>Josh did work for
<a href=https://cloudskills.io/ rel=noopener>CloudSkills.io</a>, passed some certification exams, and wrote the book all in a very short time period. </p></li><li><p>While writing the book Josh ignited a passion for writing.  Previously he had never seen it as a full-time gig.  It became visible that he could potentially make writing a full-time gig. </p></li><li><p>Joining Stack Overflow was Josh&rsquo;s dream job and had been for the previous 7 years. </p></li><li><p>Josh had this locked in as his dream job as soon as
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/a-career-journey-through-the-microsoft-ecosystem-with-steven-murawski-part-1/ rel=noopener>Steven Murawski</a> was a SRE at Stack Overflow.  Josh was getting into Desired State Configuration much like Steven had in the process of becoming a
