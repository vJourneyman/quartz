<a href=https://letselevate.tech/ rel=noopener>Elevate Technology Partners</a> out of Grand Rapids, Michigan. #ElevateTechnologyPartners</p></li><li><p>The owner of the company was a friend of a mutual friend of Mike&rsquo;s (<a class="internal-link broken">Jenifer Slabaugh</a>). </p></li><li><p>Jen had previously approached Mike about this company starting at one point. </p></li><li><p>The company owner (Josh) reached out to Mike about working a project for Elevate near the end of 2020. </p></li><li><p>Josh would check in with Mike daily because he knew Mike was struggling. </p></li><li><p>This guy was basically a stranger who was kind enough to go the distance in supporting Mike, even praying for him. </p></li><li><p>Josh sent Mike a song about not losing hope when all else is lost that was extremely helpful. </p></li><li><p>It is imperative to be open to the fact that things can get better / less hard. </p></li><li><p>You learn to get up, take a shower, and that you even enjoy taking the dog outside. </p></li><li><p>For an employer (Josh) to reach out and &ldquo;be real&rdquo; in offering a helping hand to someone in Mike&rsquo;s situation was amazing.  Josh allowed Mike to make the call about how much he could handle and when he could handle it. </p></li><li><p>At first Mike was hesitant to start work because of his state of mind, but Josh kept asking. </p></li><li><p>Mike wishes the same experience or better for anyone else out there. </p></li><li><p>Listen to Mike&rsquo;s explanation of both sides of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve this.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>Have the humility to accept goodness in your life in whatever form that takes. </p></li><li><p>If overwhelmed by emotion and experience, it&rsquo;s ok.   </p></li><li><p>Being given the lifeline and being told to just keep going helped. </p></li><li><p>Mike started writing throughout this process, and it has been therapeutic.  There is not a lot of material out there for fathers going through a similar experience. </p></li><li><p>Was the return to work a refreshing sense of normalcy? </p></li><li><p>Mike even enjoyed going on Sales calls after going back to work.  He&rsquo;s still having fun with it.  The mantra is &ldquo;do good work.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>Mike has been enabled to be an advisor and advocate for what the customer actually needs. </p></li><li><p>Solving difficult problems can be an organizational change (a process, etc.) and does not always align to a product. </p></li><li><p>Distractions are welcome.  Mike reconnected with his identity as a worker and provider with a very gentle onramp at his own pace. </p></li><li><p>Mike was able to dictate his own pace. </p></li><li><p>Adding the working routine in too early can be detrimental to your healing process.  It certainly didn&rsquo;t work for Mike. </p></li><li><p>Many folks say in a situation like Mike&rsquo;s there has to be a break from who you were entirely in certain areas. </p></li><li><p>Find where your experience fits again.  You find something to live for and pursue it. </p></li><li><p>Mike is grateful for what the loss opened his eyes up to, realizing the importance giving back. </p></li><li><p>We&rsquo;re happy to hear Mike is in a better place. </p></li><li><p>Nick was initially hesitant to approach Mike about this episode but so glad he did. </p></li><li><p>Mike agreed the topic needed to be discussed. </p></li><li><p>It is always valuable to share experiences. </p></li></ul><h2 id=contact-ushttpstwittercomnerdjourney-if-you-need-help-on-the-journey><a href=https://twitter.com/NerdJourney rel=noopener>Contact us</a> if you need help on the journey.</h2></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://graph.nerd-journey.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://graph.nerd-journey.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
