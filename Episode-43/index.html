<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/ rel=noopener>Nick Korte</a>â€¯(
<a href=https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/ rel=noopener>@NetworkNerd_</a>), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we&rsquo;d been given earlier in our careers. In today&rsquo;s episode we talk to
<a href=https://twitter.com/ecbanks rel=noopener>Ethan Banks</a>, co-founder of the
<a href=https://packetpushers.net/hosts/ rel=noopener>Packet Pushers</a> technical podcast network about becoming a podcaster and turning that hobby into a business.Â Â Â </p><p>Original Recording Date: 05-28-2019Â </p><p>Topics â€“ Beginning to Podcast and Turning Hobby into BusinessÂ </p><p>##Â  1:47 â€“ Getting into PodcastingÂ </p><ul><li><p>Podcasting for Ethan was an evolution of blogging.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>He started a CCIE blog in 2007 as a study guide while he was working through the certification.Â </p></li><li><p>There were not many networking podcasts out there, so Ethan thought it would be good topic.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>At the same time
<a href=https://etherealmind.com/ rel=noopener>Greg Farrow</a> was looking to recruit writers for his blog.Â  Ethan didn&rsquo;t want to write but wanted someone to help host the podcast.Â  Coincidentally, Greg had been talking to someone named Dan Hughes about recording a podcast.Â </p></li><li><p>The trio started recording together as a result.Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan had done some audio work for the church he attended and even mixed an album for a friend of his.Â  He had enough experience to put a good product out the door from an audio standpoint.Â </p></li><li><p>Early on, Dan had to leave the podcast due to his role, leaving Ethan and Greg to move forward together.Â </p></li><li><p>Fun fact â€“ Ethan took a brief break from co-hosting the podcast to take Divinity classes but decided it was not for him.Â  A friend that filled in for Ethan on the podcast stepped aside when Ethan was ready to return.Â </p></li><li><p>Managing work, blogging, and podcasting was brutal.Â </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Committing to a weekly show means you need to have a show every week.&rdquo;Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Coordinating schedules with guests can be challenging.Â </p></li><li><p>Shows have to be recorded and then edited before released.Â  An edit can take time depending on how comfortable the guest is on the air.Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan had a long commute on top of all of this (more than 2 hours per day).Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan was doing contract blogs for extra money as well as maintaining personal blogs.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>The podcast numbers took off, taking the subscribers from hundreds to thousands.Â  They felt pressure to get good guests and good content to avoid disappointing listeners.Â </p></li><li><p>People may not consider the burden to listeners before starting something that has potential to be very successful.Â </p></li><li><p>Being married with children on top of all of this made for a VERY busy week.Â </p></li><li><p>Missing the cadence with a podcast has a different impact than missing the cadence with a blog.Â </p></li><li><p>People who like a show like it because they bond to the personality of the hosts.Â  It&rsquo;s more personal than writing.Â  &ldquo;People feel like they know you.&rdquo;Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan gives the example of
<a href=https://packetpushers.net/the-network-break/ rel=noopener>Network Break</a> missing its scheduled release and the impact.Â </p></li><li><p>Check out the
<a href=https://packetpushers.net/podcast/show-200-state-pushers/ rel=noopener>Heavy Networking Weekly Show # 200</a> Ethan references.Â </p></li><li><p>In this episode, Greg and Ethan had an open conversation about the struggle to keep up what they were doing.Â </p></li><li><p>This resulted in community feedback telling Greg and Ethan how valuable their content has been to others.Â </p></li><li><p>There are many podcasts out there.Â  Once you lose a listener, likely they will not come back.Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s difficult to commit the time to something that does not come out regularly and predictably.Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan uses these same criteria when he&rsquo;s selecting a podcast for listening.Â </p></li><li><p>Show length can also impact the audience&rsquo;s willingness to listen.Â  Over an hour may be too long.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#2156--turning-a-hobby-into-a-business><h2 id=2156--turning-a-hobby-into-a-business><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>21:56 â€“ Turning a Hobby into a BusinessÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Most of Ethan&rsquo;s work identity had come from being a hot shot Network Engineer.Â </p></li><li><p>IT Operations can wear down a person over the years.Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan speaks to the logistics of technical side gigs, the time demands of being on call, and always being prepared to fix a problem for a customer (even if it interrupts family time).Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan needed to narrow down the things on his plate to one thing.Â </p></li><li><p>He remembers sitting at his desk one day and physically locking up because he had reached his breaking point.Â  It was like aÂ wake upÂ call.Â </p></li><li><p>Money was a big factor.Â  Finances have to be in order to go out on your own.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan pumped nearly everything he had made from extra endeavors into his mortgage, which greatly reduced the risks of starting a business.Â </p></li><li><p>He had previously turned down the chance to start his own consulting firm due to financial situation.Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan&rsquo;s employer (a medical startup) would not fund internal projects, and he was unhappy.Â </p></li><li><p>At the same time, Greg was ready to make a move as well.Â  Their motivations were enough to pour all of their energies into Packet Pushers.Â </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;It needed us to pay attention to it full time.&rdquo;Â </p></li><li><p>John thinks we&rsquo;re about to wrap up, but there&rsquo; more&mldr;on lessons learnedÂ </p></li><li><p>Ethan thinks maybe he should have taken a shot at being a business owner sooner.Â  It&rsquo;s possible he could have been bought out by a larger company.Â  But he chose to be conservative.Â </p></li><li><p>He should have gone for the CCIE sooner.Â  The intimidation got to him.Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan wishes they would have figured out pricing faster when they started Packet Pushers.Â </p></li><li><p>Being risk averse has benefits too.Â  No fund raising or investors were needed to start the business (which is debt free).Â </p></li><li><p>How does Ethan keep Packet Pushers fun?Â </p></li><li><p>He still enjoys writing and podcasting, especially script writing, as well as talking to people and researching.Â  There is no lack of challenges.Â </p></li><li><p>Breaking down complex topics in a way people can understand is not so much fun as something Ethan really enjoys that doesn&rsquo;t seem to get boring after doing it for 10 years.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Some of the administrative tasks of running a business just aren&rsquo;t fun (nor will they ever be).Â  The core of the job makes up for the operational drag.Â </p></li><li><p>As an owner, you are legally on the hook to make sure things are done right.Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan loves talking to people and enjoys having people on the show who have never previously been on it.Â  He emphasizes that everyone has a story to share.Â </p></li><li><p>Ethan taught Cisco classes at one point and was a school teacher for a year.Â  The education background factors into his current role as well.Â </p></li><li><p>What is John White&rsquo;s superpower?Â </p></li><li><p>Look up the
