# Peter Principle

## Concept Description
People tend to rise to the level where they are no longer competent. This is because people who are good at their jobs are promoted. Sometimes those promotions involve additional responsibilities which the employee hasn't demonstrated competence at. Thus, the point at which they are no longer promoted is the point at which they are no longer competent at all their responsibilities.

There is a contemporary idea that this is mitigated by assigning tasks that involve temporarily taking on those responsiblities to get a chance to do them as part of the process of being promoted.
