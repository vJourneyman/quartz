# Speaker Notes - Becoming a Top Level Individual Contributor

## Deep Work for Job Excellence
- [[Deep Work]] by [[Cal Newport]]
- Doing the best work requires that you have the ability to concentrate on hard problems without distraction. As the world becomes more distracting with social media and smart phones, the ability to concentrate will lead to premium positions and premium concentration.

- [[Episode 108]] Original mention by Nick as a book goal for 2021
   From a [[Deliberate Practice]] reading list by [[James Clear]]

## Smart Notes for Job Excellence
- [[How to Take Smart Notes]] by [[Sonke Ahrens]]
- Doing your best knowledge work requires that as you ingest information, you record the information in your own words, and store it in a manner, that allows you to recall, connect, link, and publish. This concept is a stand in for the idea that real understanding of concepts comes not only from consuming them, but also recording them and teaching them. The first student is a future version of yourself who only dimly remembers the context of the information in question.

- Example of the Nerd Journey podcast and the show notes, restating the discussions.
- Highlighting the Show Notes and extracted concepts in Obsidian
- Announcing that we'll publish the information and graph

- [[Episode 148]] [[Chris Wahl]] mentioned a note-taking system incorporating labels and color-coding to remember and find things which reminded John of a Zettelkasten. Everything goes into his notes system because he won't know what's valuable until later. He also describes that writing out concepts forces you to think more deeply about the topic and perhap even improve your understanding of it, structurally and contextually.
- [[Episode 156]] [[Episode 157]] [[Josh Duffney]] links Zettelkasten with Deep Work. He was so inspired that he wrote a short book about implementing the system in Obsidian.
- [[Episode 172]] [[Evan Oldford]] commented on the intensity of the notes that went into reading Deep Work. That was done using the Smart Notes methodology. We built the episodes by reacting to literature notes John wrote.
- [[Episode 178]] [[Stephanie Wong]] discussed how real learning comes from not just reading something, but retrieving the information, processing it, and teaching it back to others. Smart Notes are exactly this process, where the first student is the future you.
- [[Episode 186]] [[Phil Monk]] described the memory palace technique, which reminds John of the spacial or graph view of a Zettelkasten.
