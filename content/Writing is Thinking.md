# Writing is Thinking

## Concept Description
The process of organizing and writing out thoughts _is_ the process of thinking. Without the organization and recording, thoughts are fleeting and lack structure. Until one records the thought in a way that can be retrieved and understood at a future time, there is no understanding of the thought or it's connections to other thoughts.
