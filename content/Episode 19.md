Process over outcomes 

-   Cultivate an attitude that rewards or chastises yourself for your process rather than your outcomes. 
    
    -   You control your process, while your outcomes have influences you can't control.

Dreaming in Bands 

-   "Bands of possibility" 
    
-   "Working at Company X is my dream job." 
    
-   There's no single dream position and no singularly wonderful company to work for. 
    
    -   There are lots of great companies out there who share similar ethics, culture, and goals 
        
    -   There are lots of positions rolling out from each of these companies, as they tend to be growing 
        
    -   How should we define a dream job? 
        
        -   Individually, but in characteristics, not specifics 
            
        -   John 
            
            -   Smart people, who think differently than me 
                
            -   Mentorship 
                
            -   Menteeship 
                
            -   Opportunity to advance 
                
            -   Centering around virtualization

-   SE @ VMware was John's dream job 
    
    -   But he became one three years ago. What now?! 
        
    -   Get a new dream? Or should the dream have been more expansive to include a band of possibilities and a path 
        
    -   Was it good process for John to fix singularly on a single position in a single region at a single company? 
        
        -   NO! 
            
        -   AWS? GCP? Cisco? Resellers? 
            
        -   SE? Solution Architect? Pure sales? Post-sales consultant? 
            
        -   California, Arizona, Colorado, PNW, Nevada? 
            
-   What's John's dream now? 
    
    -   The bands of possibilities 
        
    -   Role, location, even company 
        
-   Why have a dream? 
    
    -   Too out of reach? 
        
    -   Too much fantasy while the reality of our jobs passes us by? 
        
    -   People might dream too far in the future without thinking about the intermediate steps 
        
    -   It's fine to use the word "goal" as a less lowered word 
        
    -   Have both short, intermediate, and long term goals 
        
    -   The further away the time frame, the more we should think about a band if possibilities 
        
    -   Maybe a dreamer is an expert goal-setter? 
        
    -   Having progression as a goal 
        
    -   Be open to possibilities
