# Working In-Office

## Concept Description
A company cultural or organizational preference for employees to work from a company office instead of working from home or working remotely. 

Complicated in a post-Covid19 world where people have discovered a preference and ability to work remotely. Also complicated in the interplay between those who have continuing concerns with catching Covid19 and those who don't (or those who see having workers in offices as more important than the risks of Covid).
