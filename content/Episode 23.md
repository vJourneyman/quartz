# Episode 23

Welcome to episode 23 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode, we discuss John's 3 Year Check-in at VMware, Part 1. 

Original Recording Date: 2019-1-26 

Topics – John's 3 Year Check-in at VMware, John's Observations 

========================================================================================================== 

## 1:30 Topics Begin 

* How did John fare at Michael Jordan trivia since this is episode 23? 

* John and Nick have hire dates that are roughly 2 years apart. 

## 4:31 What Has John Learned? 

* 4:31 Core job functions 

* Reached competence in year 1 

* Explaining the portfolio 

* Virtual desktop was a blind spot 

* Portfolio much larger than it once was 

* Understanding where these products have relevance to customer business problems 

* Coming up with a good company elevator pitch was important.  John gives the example of having to do this at a career fair. 

* Understanding customer business issues was new to John. 

* Building relationships within customer organizations and being relevant 

* How close does John see the role of the SE to the account representative? 

* We have to know where our solutions will definitely and when to rule them out based on the situation (first level technical qualification). 

* John supports two account reps. 

* An account rep will be focused on higher level relationships within the organization that a SE may not have. 

* 14:20 Extended job functions 

* Built up to competence in year two 

* Extending relationships with the VMware business units to product team members, technical support team members, etc. 

* Using large events like VMworld / others to build better relationships with customers 

* 18:16 Building an internal network / determining career trajectory 

* Competency in year three 

* Build stronger relationships with the partner ecosystem 

* John had to learn the value to the company from going through a partner / reseller. 

* Sometimes deals are better taken directly than through a reseller. 

* Partners may need to help with implementation or help customers manage support contracts.  John gives a nice example of when he leaned on a partner for help as a customer. 

* John cites participation in communities such as [Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/) as a way to get some information on how the ecosystem works. 

* Other organizations within the company like OCTO (Office of the CTO) 

* Relationships with tech marketing folks 

## 25:02 – What is the Job?  

* 25:02 Customer focus 

* It's very important to understand what the customer does on a very basic level (their product, how they sell, what their value is in the market, who their competition is, how they view themselves, etc.). 

* Customers need to know you're willing to help before sharing certain information with you.  It comes down to the types of relationships one has within the organization. 

* Understanding customer organizational structure and how they measure success is important before proposing any solutions. 

* Overcoming internal challenges like politics and personnel takes time.   

* John didn't see the big picture of making the organization / department successful as a customer and had to learn it after leaving the customer side.   

* John had to learn who in the organization has purchased from us, the level of success they have experienced, and how the expanding portfolio is addressing the expanding organizational challenges. 

* There's an education element to this job as well.  If customers don't know our capabilities, we cannot help them. 

* Listen to what John shares about multiple IT groups existing within organizations and the variance he's seen across the board. 

* 43:59 Customer business problem focus 

* Executive Initiatives 

* Business Initiatives 

* Technology Initiatives 

* VMware Solutions 

* This required John to train his mind in a new way of thinking. 

* Check out [Episode 16](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-016-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-1-before-applying/) and [Episode 4](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-004-company-culture-and-resume-writing/) for our discussions of how managers may / may not understand the big picture and where your work / project fits into the goals an organization. 

* John feels like this problem is more common in smaller organizations. 

* Putting structure into an IT organization may not be prioritized. 

* 50:56 Product focus 

* The portfolio continues to advance and expand (acquisitions, etc.). 

* Be aware of new operating models such as cloud, edge, and managed. 

* We must keep up to date to stay relevant to customers. 

* 53:21 Personal development 

* Expanded knowledge of the marketplace 

* John must maintain relevance in areas that are relevant to customers (AWS / GCP / Azure, storage, networking, security, compute). 

* Check out [Episode 6](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-006-the-ins-and-outs-of-training-why-how-what-and-when) and [Episode 7](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-007-professional-networking-and-training-revisited) on areas of training and training adjacencies. 

* Relevance to other employers may just be a side effect of what we do.  Organizations must focus on being employees engaged. 

* The next episode will be Nick grilling John.  It's coming....
