Topic – [[Burn Out]] and Recovery [[Josh Fidel]] [[Episode 76]] [[Episode 77]] [[Mental Health]] [[MOC - Mental Health]]

=================================== 

##  2:14 - Burn Out and Bail Out 

* Josh loved the job and the work he did within the Globals segment at VMware.   

* The pressure put on Josh and his teammates was immense.  Each was responsible for $15M in sales for the year. 

* The sales cycles in large organizations are lengthy, and planning has to happen in advance (possibly years in advance of when a purchase may be made). 

* Josh was thinking about what would happen in the next 1-2 years with these customers and not what would happen in the next two weeks to close a deal. 

* Everything was more visible to leadership. 

* The traveling was so much that Josh would get home on Friday and have to get back on a plane by Monday morning.  It was detrimental to his family life. 

* One day he woke up in a hotel room, did not remember where he was, who he was supposed to meet with, and what the meeting was about.   

* "This is insane." - Josh Fidel 

* He sat on the edge of the bed in frustration and realized he was destroying his physical and emotional health as well as the relationship with his family.   

* "This company won't look after me when I am old." - Josh Fidel 

* "I needed to take a step back." - Josh Fidel 

* Josh scheduled back surgery soon after this. 

* "I'm building these crystal palaces at the cost of what really matters." - Josh Fidel 

* After 3 months home with the family, Josh did not want to go back. 

* He got to do something awesome that few people will get to do but needed to take care of what was important. 

## 9:52 - A Look at Josh's Current State 

* The pressure is much less, and all the tools are in his toolbox now. 

* He is happier now and gets to spend more time with his family. 

* Looking back, Josh said his temper grew shorter before reaching the breaking point.  

* He would tolerate poor decision making less and would be more vocal about it. 

* Other people commented on him being "wound up." 

* People don't see these things while caught up in them.  He had a goal and became so focused that the signs were missed. 

* Josh thinks he may not have practiced mindfulness at the time.  He may not have come to such abrupt decisions. 

* It's much easier to stay up late working now and only lose 30 minutes of sleep compared to having to fly back home from another country. 

* John makes an interesting point about western culture and the expected role and perception of men. 

* Josh has learned to overcome toxic masculinity by being comfortable with him self and what he is doing. 

* Many people have a hard time being honest with themselves. 

* Some of the most competent people in technology Josh knows are a little quirky. 

* Maybe establishing the brand first allows you to be yourself later? 

* Josh is confident he won't have to worry about the next job because he is good what he does, and other people know it. 

* Josh is not afraid to speak up if management is doing something that seems wrong and gives a great example of how management at his current employer processes feedback from employees. 

* People in management may be slightly more educated, but at the end of the day we are just people. 

* Right now people are likely going to expect more from their management.  John and Josh cite a number of examples based on current events. 

## 26:00 - The Importance of [[Organizational Character]] and Being Selective 

* Character matters at all times but becomes especially important under stress. 

* The company Josh works for now has character.  The president took a large pay cut to sustain the company and asked people to take smaller pay cuts so everyone would succeed. 

* Josh is willing to forego quarterly bonuses to allow other people at the company to succeed (i.e. so a more junior person does not get laid off).   

* Inspirational leaders need to walk the walk and not just talk a big game.  Josh cites a specific example. 

* Maybe you cannot be selective about who you work for today (i.e. an organization led by a decent leader). 

* It is always easier to find a job while you have one than when you don't. 

* This is about knowing what you value in a manager / company leader and helps you evaluate the organization as a potential employer. 

* Great job interview question to ask a future employer - "what did you do for your employees during [[COVID-19]]?" 

* Josh mentions a number of interviews he had with leaders inside VMware before being hired, which helped him make a decision. 

* You as a candidate have the opportunity to say NO to a company after meeting anyone in the interview chain.  Don't forget that! 

* It's never wrong to ask to talk to someone's boss to help you evaluate whether a company is a fit. 

* Sometimes more money is not compensation enough for oppressive culture. 

* Think about the kind of person you would be happy to work for someday. 

* Does poor management / oppressive culture / a toxic system stifle innovation?  Listen to what Josh has to say, and you decide. 

* People are so tied to their job in this country (job as identity). 

* Is the current crisis that perfect opportunity to step back and turn introspective for people, organizations, regions, the world and make better decisions? 

* Take a critical eye to what you are, what you have become, and where you want to go. 

* As long as you are alive, there are options, even if they are not the best options.  

## 42:56 - Closing Thoughts 

* The story of Josh's burn out and change parallels where we are as a society. 

* "We are all sitting on the edge of our bed." - Josh Fidel 

* Hopefully we all take a step back, looks at what has happened, and makes some decisions that we will make the world a better place…but not at the cost of someone else.
