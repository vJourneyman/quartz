# Episode 50

Welcome to episode 50 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we have part 2 of our discussion with [Marisa Eckberg]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/marisaeckberg/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marisaeckberg/)). We discuss how the Human Resources department affects company culture, evaluating company culture from the outside, and when to go to HR with issues.

Topics – Part 2 with Marisa Eckberg - Human Resources and Company Culture  

## 03:01 – Human Resources and Company Culture 

* Senior leadership has different perceptions of HR.  This limits the overall impact. 

* Keeping them out of legal trouble 

* Champions of culture who offer management strategies, help encourage productivity, etc. 

* Help make this "a cool place to work" 

* Kill off the annual performance review 

* Need HR to be the police 

* There is a transition in HR in relation to titles 

* Chief People Officer 

* Human Capital Management 

* People Operations 

* Chief People Strategist 

* Note: Over the years this industry has changed from Personnel to Human Resources to People-centric 

## 08:12 – Detecting How a Company Values Culture 

* Check the company's social media pages as well as Glassdoor.  Are employees posting about what is happening at the company? 

* Marisa does "sleuth work" on new clients in this way. 

* Search for people who currently work for the company or some who have worked there in the past in similar roles. 

* Culture is organic.  HR is a facilitator of culture. 

* Maybe they facilitate a costume contest for Halloween or approach management with the idea to do it. 

* Marisa gives the example of [Zappos]([https://www.zappos.com/](https://www.zappos.com/)). 

* The company allows employees to do things they want to do to keep the environment fun. 

* Zappos looks for cultural fit in interviews and turns people away who are not a fit. 

* Book recommendation – [Built on Value by Ann Rhoades]([https://www.amazon.com/Built-Values-Creating-Outperforms-Competition/dp/0470901926](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Values-Creating-Outperforms-Competition/dp/0470901926)) 

* Do companies "culture wash" their speak to attract talent? 

* Company culture is definitely a buzz phrase, but it comes down to employee engagement (connection between the employee and the work they are doing for the company, feeling of constributing to something bigger). 

* Cool amenities are nice but do not promote employee engagement. 

* What do employees doing the work need to stay engaged? 

* Before you start looking for companies and applying for jobs, find out what you value.  Likely you want a company with similar values to get a good fit. 

* See [Episode 17]([http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-017-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-part-2-2-during-interviews-and-after-the-offer/](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-017-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-part-2-2-during-interviews-and-after-the-offer/)) on the idea of value match. 

* Who can help an employee change company culture? 

* If you have a good relationship with your manager, start there.  Ask if you should talk to HR. 

* You can certainly still talk to HR, but bring ideas (positive suggestions) and not complaints. 

* Come with suggestions to solve problems / improve the culture. 

* Maybe HR could help programmatize something that worked really well for your team so that it can help other teams. 

## 26:05 – Going to HR with Issues 

* When should employees go to HR with a problem? 

* Is HR only there to protect employer reputation? 

* Take policy violations to HR. 

* Personal conflicts with a coworker may be better suited for a conversation with your manager.  HR is probably going to ask you this. 

* HR is more of an escalation point...unless you don't feel comfortable speaking to your manager about it. 

* Don't make your first interaction with HR a situation where you are raising a problem.   

* Say hello when you see the HR team.  Built some rapport first if possible.
