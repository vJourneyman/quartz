# Climb the Individual Contributor seniority ladder or go somewhere where you can

## Concept Description
In many cases, individual contributors consider a management career because they view it as the only way to progress in their careers. However, good organizations should have a technical career path that allows people to advance in seniority and responsibility without taking on management responsibilities. 

An example seniority ladder might be: 
Engineer --> Senior Engineer --> Staff Engineer --> Principal Engineer --> Distinguished Fellow

If the organization one is in doesn't have a career path of increasing seniority and pay without taking on management responsibilities, it might be time to consider a different organization, which does. That can mean moving to a different organization with the same job role within the same company, but might mean moving to a different company. This is common in small organizations where increasing seniority and responsibilities might not exist, but can exist in larger organizations where there are no opportunities to move laterally.
