Welcome to episode 37 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss .

Topics – Jon Hildebrand 

===================================== 

## 2:26 – Jon's Background and Career Journey, The Cerner Years 

* Today Jon is a Principal Technologist at [Cohesity]([https://www.cohesity.com/](https://www.cohesity.com/)) and is located in Kansas City. 

* He spent 14 years with a specific company and moved to a service provider for around 4 years before getting "axed." 

* Jon realized early on that networking would be very important in his career.   

* Jon was part of the IT staff at the college he attended and landed a job at [Cerner](https://www.cerner.com/) along with several classmates.  His first role was that of a consultant. 

* How is working with college professors similar to working with seasoned IT professionals?  List to Jon's take on that. 

* One of Jon's major projects was tackling a Citrix environment in the early 2000s.  This was a 6-year endeavor and required heavy travel. 

* Jon then moved over to managing internal systems (VMware and others) to broaden the technology focus. 

* By the time he was close to finishing up at Cerner, he was part of a 4-5 person team that managed 80,000 to 100,000 virtual machines and 2500 – 3000 hosts. 

* The scale of the environment required learning automation skills, and Jon started exploring [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) and [PowerCLI](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/PowerCLI/), drawing on a background in software engineering. 

* Jon speaks to his discontent with sitting in the middle.  He began to get involved in user groups like [VMUG](https://www.vmug.com/).   

* He started to really enjoy presenting and realized he did not enjoy what he was doing at his day job. 

* Someone he knew from school let him know about a new opening at a service provider. 

## 12:46 - Moving to [LightEdge Solutions](https://www.lightedge.com/) 

* This role would expose Jon to learning networking, storage, and managing multiple global datacenters (not just a single datacenter). 

* He spent 4 years here and did some great work in process standardization. 

* Something as simple as building a server could change hands 8 times.  Jon was able to trim some of these processes like building a virtual machine down from weeks to just a few minutes. 

* The automation bug never really left Jon, and even now, he's still into PowerShell. 

* At Cerner he was hyper-focused on virtualization, but the role at LightEdge allowed him to touch and gain insight into other areas (or silos). 

* Jon speaks to other reasons for leaving Cerner in this light. 

* Jon transitioned to more of an architect than an engineer after being exposed to the pain points of the system as a whole. 

* One of the reasons this transition was easy for him to make was his ability to improve processes. 

* When you begin to analyze departmental silos, this is an analysis of environmental culture.  Jon speaks to the different mentalities on the organizational structure of technology departments. 

* John White weighs in on his experience with organizational structure. 

* Beware of "that's how we've always done it" in interviews. 

* What other red flags does Jon recommend you look for when interviewing?
