# Committing to Career Advancement

## Concept Description
Career advancement may happen accidentaly, but it makes more sense to commit oneself to putting focus on the subject. Analyze the gap between current state and your ideal state. Create an accountability system for yourself to work toward advancement. Start with small increments until it's a habit, then slowly increase them. [[Atomic Habits]] [[Episode 1]]
