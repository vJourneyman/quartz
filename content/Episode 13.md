19:07 - Nick remembers [BBigford's Spiceworks post](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1952694-cold-calling-for-jobs-empower-yourself) on searching door to door 

-   John thinks that's more a shotgun approach 
    
-   John labels Tom as a job hunting sniper 
    
-   Tom peels back the onion on his role in Indiana. 
    
    -   He fell in love with manufacturing, despite no formal education in it 
        
    -   First few positions were beneficial, but not a source of passion 
        
    -   The passion he developed spawned getting involved in the user community and sharing the passion 
        
    -   Desire to become a Subject Matter Expert 
        
    -   Learn to think like a problem solver 
        
-   Tom leveraged the [Epicor Users Group](https://www.epicorusers.org/) for information on companies using Epicor software in Dallas / Fort Worth. 
    
    -   He researched 10 companies and narrowed the list 4 that would be a good fit, making those part of a first wave 
        
    -   His wife works in the career services department for a college, so he had a built-in advisor 
        
    -   She drove the methodology behind finding a place to work and seeing if there was a fit for someone like Tom 
        
    -   The employer who hired Tom had no posted position at the time 
        
-   John wouldn't think to apply at a place without a listed position, but would advise his clients to have a process to grab rare talent on short notice if it's available 
    
-   Tom gives full credit to his wife for developing the methodology for the job search 
    

26:07 - Identifying Prospective Employers 

-   John digs into the idea of looking for a place you would like to work.  What were the criteria used to narrow down to 4 companies as a first pass, and how did you come up with it? 
    
-   Some of the criteria were… 
    
    -   Type of business 
        
    -   Process and product were interesting 
        
    -   Environment intriguing 
        
    -   Wouldn't feel bored or stale after a while there 
        
    -   Geography - location that could compliment wife's job location 
        
    -   In like with his passion 
        
    -   There were not as many online reviews of companies in 2008. 
        
    -   The goal was to start with a small initial group to be able to show he'd done deep research about them 
        
-   Two of four companies responded 
    
-   Once he got some responses, he didn't pursue the other two 
    
-   50% yield on blind submissions! 
    
-   Tom says "they weren't looking for me.   I was looking for them." 
    

31:44 - Nick's Recollection of Tom joining the organization 

-   Nick tells his version of the story of when Tom started 
    
-   Tom gives his take on stepping into a role with no real job description 
    
    -   Two execs offloaded their responsibilities 
        
    -   They were new to Epicor and saw an opportunity to bring in a subject matter expert 
        
    -   This turned into a collaboration with the business 
        
    -   This morphed into the birth of the IT department 
        
-   What do you think it took for those executives to take a chance? 
    
-   Have you learned any lessons from this? 
    
-   Tom discusses reasons executives took a chance on him through his entrepreneurial lens. 
    
    -   Find a way to take a chance on talent when you find it 
        
    -   Serious vetting 
        
    -   What is the risk to hire, what's the upside 
        
    -   Can the candidate contribute to the overall goal of the business? 
        
    -   Trust is a big factor 
        
    -   Trust feeds into management style 
        
-   Shoot from the hip and flexibility, but very invested in great outcomes 
    
-   Be flexible while ensuring employees / end customers are getting the best return 
    

38:55 - Closing Thoughts 

-   John re-read [BBigford's Cold-Calling for Jobs post](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1952694-cold-calling-for-jobs-empower-yourself) and thinks it's a little more focused than his initial reaction 
    
-   Nick notes that the post was a follow-up to [BBigford's post on getting terminated and hustling for a new job the same day](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1952671-out-of-the-ditch-and-up-the-mountain-i-go)
