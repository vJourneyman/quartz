# Episode 24

Welcome to episode 24 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode, we discuss John's 3 Year Check-in at VMware, Part 2. 

Original Recording Date: 2019-2-2 

Topics – John's 3 Year Check-in at VMware, Nick's Questions 

========================================================================================================== 

## 1:55 Topics Begin 

* Check out [part 1](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-023-johns-3-year-check-in-at-vmware-part-1/) of John's 3 Year check-in if you missed it last week. 

* John mentions sports research.  Was he prepared for what came next? 

## 2:54 What has Made John stay with the company? 

* John considered this a medium to long-term job once he joined.  

* He loves the technology VMware has and the innovations as well as the overall technology space. 

* John has enjoyed exposure to new customer problems and situations (technical, political, etc.). 

* The constant change keeps it interesting. 

* Building good relationships with customers is part of the job and a nice perk. 

* The overall experience has been enjoyable.  John describes this as a process of continual improvement (always considering ways to get better), which has involved self-study as well as collaboration with others. 

* The goal is to always do the right thing for the customer to maintain a long-term good relationship, even if it means advising them not to buy something. 

* Everyone has more expertise than someone else and less than others.  John is a relative Yoda rather than an absolute Yoda 

## 10:32 Is John where he thought he might be after 3 years at the company? 

* John applied a number of times before getting into the company.  He had applied for a technical marketing role around the same time as applying for the SE role. 

* He had to sell the company on the fact that his career progression was not tied to a specific position or role.   

* Mentoring was something he wanted – to be a mentor and to be mentored. 

* He's been able to be more active in social media, attend events, podcast, etc.   

* A specific title was not part of the goal.  He focused more on the controllable steps to achieve what was needed to accomplish a promotion. 

* Nick's book recommendation – [Chasing Excellence](https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Excellence-Building-Fittest-Athletes/dp/1619617285) by [Ben Bergeron](https://benbergeron.com) 

* Check out our episode on [Process over Outcomes](http://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/) as well. 

* Figure out the process.  Do the things you can control.  If your measure of success is promotion to a specific title, you will be disappointed. 

* John has been iterating. 

* If there's nowhere for you to go at your current employer, you may not get recognized as you think you should be.  Maybe the goal should be to get a better job elsewhere.  Being excellent at what you do will always be in demand. 

## 21:45 Favorite memory from the time at VMware 

* John tells a story about being nerd famous. 

* Giving someone else a tour of the VMware Palo Alto campus for the first time was a great experience. 

## 24:42 How does John stay relevant while working for a vendor? 

* Relevance can be measured in different ways. 

* The ability to help customers solve problems over the long term is one way to measure it. 

* John also cites ramping on the growing product portfolio and knowing the value of each as another way to be relevant. 

* John cannot be a pure technical expert at everything, but he knows the right technical resources to engage when needed.  

## 28:04 Does John missing being a customer? 

* He misses having 100% input and control over technology solution decisions.  It was easy to do as part of a small business, but there is probably not a job he can go into to get that level of control. 

* He's currently able to be an influencer at a number of different levels within multiple organizations. 

## 31:53 What's the least glamorous part of working for a vendor? 

* The nuts and bolts of the Sales process and being part of Sales meetings is not always 100% enjoyable.  "Not every part of dinner is desert." 

* Knowledge of the Sales process can be valuable for anyone in an organization.  Check out [Episode 5](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-005-sales-skills-for-it-and-questionable-advice/) for more on this. 

* Nick had to learn about this after moving to the SE role. 

* [The IBM Sales process model](https://www-154.ibm.com/sales/salesconnect/olh/en_us/olh/prod/mysa/opportunity_management/opportunities/opportunity_basics.html) 

## 38:46 How has the amount of travel been since joining?  Do you have any travel tips? 

* Amount of travel is ultimately dependent upon the role.  Even for those with the same job title, the amount of travel is different. 

* John is flying about once per quarter and usually has to drive 3 days per week. 

* John's travel essentials: 

* Packing lists for everything (good way to lower stress) 

* Different lists for local vs. long distance travel 

* Nick pressures John to write a blog on this. Send us a Tweet if you want to see it happen! 

* Sign up for [GlobalEntry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry) if you are flying with any kind of frequency (includes [TSA Pre Check](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/how-do-i-apply-tsa-precheck)). 

* Sign up for travel rewards programs. 

* Dongle from [automatic.com](https://automatic.com/) to capture mileage 

* Capture expense receipts with your phone camera to avoid loss 

## 48:58 If this is your dream job, how do you determine what's next? 

* Should John become a full time career coach? 

* His dream for 5 years was to be a SE at VMware.  On day one of the job, he realized it was time to figure out a new dream. 

* John deconstructed what he enjoys doing: 

* Mentoring other SEs 

* Figuring out best practices across segments, specialties, etc. 

* Peer collaboration 

* More one-to-many conversations (i.e. outside of just his customers) 

* Speaking at [VMUGs](https://www.vmug.com) / conferences 

* Giving more presentations 

* John talked through the Principal program but mentioned he cannot just success / failover based on this alone. 

* These items lend themselves to a number of roles. 

* Figure out what he has time to work one, and see if other roles present themselves. 

## 55:47 Would you consider a move from generalist to specialist? 

* Nick cites examples like technical marketing for a specific product or SE specialist in a particular area. 

* John mentioned the challenge as a generalist to get deep enough in a specific product area. 

* He would probably need to be open to moving wherever the role is available (i.e. large concentration in his area). 

* He's keeping his eyes open but not committed to any specific path. 

## 58:40 When did you start co-hosting the [VMware Roundtable Communities Podcast](https://www.talkshoe.com/show/vmware-communities-roundtable)? 

* John started going to VMware meetup events and ran into [Eric Nielsen](https://twitter.com/ericnipro). 

* Eric was looking for a podcast co-host with experience in the field, and John fit the bill. 

* The opportunity presented itself because John went to meetups in the first place. 

* John had an idea for doing a podcast that eventually morphed into the Nerd Journey podcast. 

## 01:03:06 What's a lesson learned the hard way? 

* Not everyone is reasonable or sees the company as an important partner. 

* John has had some confrontational interactions.  It's challenging to not take this kind of thing personally. 

* You can only control your reactions to situations. 

## 01:05:14 How has work-life balance been over the years? 

* Nick was out of balance when he first started and still has spurts. 

* In some ways working from home has been incredibly freeing. 

* John says the most difficult thing has been managing how much he's working. 

* There is always something to do. 

* It takes time to get better at this? 

* Sometimes you have to choose to go to sleep and take care of yourself. 

## 01:08:28 What would make you leave the company tomorrow? 

* Ethical mismatch with what the company was doing 

* Cultural gap between expectations and reality (i.e. "bro culture", discriminatory culture, etc.) 

* Career issues 

* Not being valued / recognized as a good team member 

* Career dead end (builds up over time) / unable to progress 

* Family issues 

* None of these have ever been an issue.
