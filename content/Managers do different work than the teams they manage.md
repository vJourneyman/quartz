# Managers do different work than the teams they manage

## Concept Description
Managers of teams have a job that is almost completely different from the teams they manage, requiring very different skills. Their major tasks involve resource management, performance management, hiring, firing, and acting as an interface between their team and upstream management.

When considering a career change from individual contributor to people management, consider whether you'd be happy no longer doing what you're doing now, and doing something extremely different.
