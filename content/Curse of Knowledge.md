# Curse of Knowledge

## Concept Description
The idea that people who know information deeply might not be the best teachers of that information, as they've lost connection with being a beginner. It's difficult as someone who's expert in a field to know what contextual and supporting knowledge a beginner won't have.

[[Teachers Need to Understand Information To Teach It]]
[[Apprentice, Journeyman, Master]] process, where apprentices typically had to learn a catalog of contextual information without understanding the future context where they'd need the information. This was often copying versions of a Master's notes from his apprenticeship. This clearly depends on a chain of knowledge and additions as Masters added to their notes. And clearly depended on the Master caring about maintaining that chain.
