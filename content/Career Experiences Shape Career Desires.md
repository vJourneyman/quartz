# Career Experiences Shape Career Desires

## Concept Description
Going through experiences we do and don't like in our careers helps us to define what we want and don't want in our dream workplace. On the negative side, unless one experiences lack of communication, micro-management, or undefined goals (for example), it's difficult to articulate exactly how important avoiding those things are. On the positive side, unless one has experienced something positive such as a good team culture, helpful management, and great collaboration, it's difficult to articulate how important seeking those things are.
