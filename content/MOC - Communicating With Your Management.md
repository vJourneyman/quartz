# MOC - Communicating With Your Management

## General
- [[Episode 83]] [[Episode 84]] [[Brad Pinkston]] Transitioning to a new manager; Find out how your new boss prefers to be communicated with (improves relationship)
- [[Episode 172]] [[Evan Oldford]] Daily Report to management as a shutdown routine (report containing no more than 5 concise points that add insight and could be read while waiting to get coffee at Starbucks) with BLUF (bottom line up front) to ensure no one misses (i.e. danger of missing a project deadline, context of customer CSAT issue, etc.).  No manager has complained about too much reporting, and this allows gaining visibility within an organization. Side benefit of de-stressing [[Visibility Through Reporting]]
- [[Episode 45]] Career Conversations with Your Management - importance of regular 1-1s and determining whether the environment is right for career conversations to happen, managers as a broker for what's next (i.e. help find internal role), agree on goals
- [[Episode 114]]  [[Brad Christian]] Help your boss realize your worth by drawing attention to what you are doing.  Let others know too.  If you don't sell yourself, no one will.  Brad struggles with getting his people to cheerlead for themselves. He tells his team to make a folder and call it I Love Me. Every time you get an e-mail complimenting you, save all of that to help you remember what you did successfully, and use it to help your managers.
