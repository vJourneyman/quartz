# Show Your Work for High Performance

## Concept Description
More detail on this subject can be found in the book [[Show Your Work!]] by [[Austin Kleon]].

A path to improving your performance and *perception* of your performance is to "show your work". Participate in communities of people in your industry or job description. Be an active, positive participant in the community. Learn from the community. Give back to the community by teaching what you're an expert at as well as what you're in the process of exploring and learning.
