Topics - Asking for more money as a raise and when you're being hired 

=================================================================================== 

## 4:52 Asking for a Raise

* Stand Up And Stand Out 

* Do the job that the next level deserves 

* How do you know about whether there are different levels of seniority when you're interviewing? 

* Balance against exploitation 

* Make sure you're taking on work that matters to your management team 

* Measurable accomplishments 

* Solicit feedback on tracking towards review/raise periods 

* This requires planning over the year running up to a review period 

* Be Assertive 

* Some managers will only give higher raises when it's asked for - John's reaction: Yikes! 

* Back Up Your Claims 

* Track your performance to measurable things 

* Have it a regular topic in your 1-on-1s, so it's not a surprise 

* (Manager Tools: Professional Success Section)[https://www.manager-tools.com/map-universe/professional-success] 

* Prepare Answers To Possible Questions 

* Document and have it ready 

* Go over accomplishments before the review period to arm your manager 

* Include money you made or saved the company to combat "We just don't have the budget" excuse 

* Nick points out that documenting extra responsibilities also serves as resume points if the company thinks that your awesome extra effort doesn't deserve a raise 

## 30:42 Negotiating a Starting Salary 

* Source: (How Much Salary Negotiation Is Too Much?)[http://jobs.washingtonpost.com/article/how-much-salary-negotiation-is-too-much-/] 

* Respect the Line 

* Set a Target Range 

* Do Your Research 

* Your relevant experience, education, and success stories 

* Market rate: Glassdoor or other sites 

* Cost of living 

* Pay band should have been discussed earlier with the recruiter 

* Is the negotiation with the recruiter or the hiring manager 

* When dealing directly with an org 

* Initial qualification with the recruiter 

* Final negotiation with the hiring manger 

* When recruited by a 3rd-party recruiting company 

* That person is like an agent interested in placement 

* Then they're interested in placing at the highest salary possible 

* Don't disclose your minimum; They're not an impartial party in the negotiation 

* [Geek Whisperers Episode 137 – Advice for the Job Hunt with Recruiter Liz Bronson](http://geek-whisperers.com/2017/09/advice-for-the-job-hunt-with-recruiter-liz-bronson-episode-137) 

* Be sensitive to making the hiring manager use a lot of political capital to get you your max salary 

* Should be about your requirements and needs, not ego 

* John's anecdote 

* Can mean your expectations are to out-perform from the beginning 

* Can mean you're not getting a raise for a while 

* Weigh Salary Against Benefits 

* Perhaps there are things you can negotiate instead of budget 

* e.g. Vacation seniority 

* What if their healthcare plan is cheaper than your current one 

* Are you moving to a lower cost-of-living area? 

* Are you closer to where you're going to be working? 

* Do Not Anticipate A Fixed Number Of Rounds 

* Getting your number right away isn't worse than a tough negotiation for it 

* Don’t presume the first offer is a low-ball 

* How often has John negotiated his entry salary?
