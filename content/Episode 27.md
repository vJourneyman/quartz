## 12:37 How does the SE role fit in with the sales organization? 

## 14:29 Any way to shorten the learning cycle? 

* Avoid spray-and-pray 

* Should've asked manager to shadow good SEs 

* Forgot the SE skills for the product skills 

## 16:09 What did Ramzi's career journey look like? 

## 17:05 Transitioning to the SE role; Did you feel yourself losing your technical hand? How about losing technical credibility? 

* Didn't know the title acronyms 

* Relationship credibility vs technical credibility 

## 20:36 Ever miss support role? 

* No 

* Paid on performance 

* Learning from variety of different customers 

## 23:44 Advice for people who are thinking about changing role due to being under-appreciated 

* Start looking before you're extremely unhappy with your current one 

* Finding a new job takes time; Learn new job skills while on your current job 

* Get better at presenting by presenting to informal lunch groups 

* Or do demos 

* Practice interviewing 

* Apply before you feel qualified 

## 27:16 How do you distinguish between companies you do and don't want to work for? 

* Tech might not be interesting, though people being interesting might change your mind 

* Bad communication during interview process 

## 28:40 Is it fair to judge a company by how they treat you during the hiring process? 

* Yes, it's fair 

* Speed of responses shows how interested they are 

* Remember you have the power not to take the offer 

## 31:40 Ever seen the stall or delay during the process? 

* Could be a committee process 

* Could be some other internal process 

* Perhaps they didn't see your value; OR you didn't show your value 

* They might just be slow; Follow up with the hiring manager 

* You're just interviewing, not hired; Keep looking until you accept an offer 

## 34:54 What does your view of the SE career path look like? 

* SE coach, mentor, manager 

* Most SEs stay SEs forever 

* SE Management is an option 

* Product management seems like an option, but they also seem to be paid less than SEs 

* Maybe it's worth it if you see lots of advancement in the PM role 

## 36:43 Decomposing the things you like about the role and finding that role that does that 

* Most SE soft skills are done outside the company 

* Ramzi starts turning the tables and asking John what he's seen 

* John's experience matches that, except for straight sales skills 

* SEs who are good at the soft skills tend to get pushed into sales roles 

* Though SEs with technical and soft skills are way more valuable 

## 39:56 How has your appreciation of the pure sales role vs. the SE role evolved 

* Used to complain about them 

* Had to cover sales for a territory once and hated it 

* John - finding the right people to get the meeting with is a skill 

* Repeated inspection by sales management at the end of the quarter 

* John says he tells his sales team he won't ask at the end of the quarter 

## 44:30 Ramzi asks John about how common career and retirement/financial planning is 

* Most people don't plan careers, they only have emergency reactions 

* There are some jobs which have a clear linear path, but most jobs aren't like that 

* Breaking people out of that blinder is a major goal of the Nerd Journey podcast 

* We need to overcome the blockers like feeling disloyal, feeling unlucky, fear, and discomfort 

* Financial planning is more common 

## 48:00 Ramzi's experience coming out of University 

* Didn't know about the various job roles coming out of University 

* Didn't know about paths once hired 

* Expecting people to stay in the same role for 20 years is ... delusional 

* John thinks positive organizational culture values people to the point of keeping them in the company, rather than the role, emphasizing career path 

* Ramzi hasn't seen that 

## 50:28 Ramzi was in a role where the manager lost 6 people, and was surprised every time 

* If the manager had actually invested in the team, they might have been more invested in finding/training their replacements 

## 51:41 John talks about his positive experience 

* Career path as an entry discussion, Chad Sakac impact radius, and IC career and compensation path 

* Ramzi asks if the company actually followed up after that entry discussion 

* Discussion of great 1 on 1s 

## 55:41 John's observations on how Product Management seems more of a mature, set, career path 

* Ramzi hasn't seen that at his orgs 

* Ramzi observes that not having a traditional background shouldn't stop you from applying 

* We discuss the fallacy of feeling the need to meet every part of a job description before applying 

## 59:27 Not so lightning round 

* Most important tool for career planning 

* Invaluable book for career 

* [Mastering Technical Sales](https://www.masteringtechnicalsales.com/)
