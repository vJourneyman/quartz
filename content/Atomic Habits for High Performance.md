# Atomic Habits for High Performance

## Concept Description
More detail on this subject can be found in the book [[Atomic Habits]] by [[James Clear]]

The path to improvement isn't sudden, large jumps forward. It is comprised of small, iterative improvements that accumulate over time. *Perceptions* of that improvement might appear from a distance to be large leaps. There can even be large leaps in understanding of concepts. 

Improvement of practical skills, unfortunately, must be done one step at a time, consistently, until it is a habit. The iterative process of building on these small habits is what accumulates to large improvements.
