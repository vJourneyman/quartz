# Smart Notes for High Performance

## Concept Description
More detail on this idea in the books [[How to Take Smart Notes]] by [[Sonke Ahrens]] and [[How to Take Smart Notes in Obsidian]] by [[Josh Duffney]] 

Capture the things that you learn every day into an organized personal knowledge management system. You won't know what's important to you later, so capture everything you can. 

Later on, organize the things that you learn and make connections between them. Digest the ideas into your own words, making them something you can teach someone else. The first person you'll be teaching is yourself in the future, when you've forgotten the information. The next useful thing for this information is as a chunk of a work presentation, internal knowledge base, or conference talk. 

Writing out the information in your own words and teaching the information to others is a process which will deepen the knowledge you have. Otherwise you might think you know the information, but only vaguely remember general points about it in the future. Useful information is information written in your own words, and linked to other thoughts in a way that allows you to find it an query the entire system for new insights.

Smart Notes will accellerate the rate at which you can generate content by allowing you to arrange pre-written concept blocks, pre-linked to their sources, as a general outline of your content, only needing to write connections between the pre-written blocks, or to identify the blocks that need to be researched and written in order to complete the content.
