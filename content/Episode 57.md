* Getting rid of high interest debt can save the most money. 

* Dave Ramsey 

* Try the debt snowball – start by focusing on the smallest debt, then use that same money to pay off the next largest until everything paid off except the house. 

* This is more psychologically rewarding and changing to help build the habit. 

* Should you stop saving for retirement to pay off debt? 

* David Bach 

* It is more beneficial to start saving for retirement as early as you can. 

*  Tackle the highest interest debt first if you can, but the snowball method is also acceptable. 

* Make your bill payments automatic so there is no need to make a decision to do it every month. 

* Nick and John's Advice 

* Stick to it, and get your spouse / family on board with the plan to succeed.

* Dave Ramsey  

* Determine where you spend your money first. 

* David Bach 

* [The Latte Factor](https://www.thelattefactor.com/#podcast) is real.  What small changes can you make now to improve your financial state?    

* Nick and John's Advice

* If the psychological reward of paying off debt is not enough, treat yourself now and then (within your means) to stay focused.

* Personal Finance for Dummies 

* Avoid financial products carrying commissions and expenses. 

* Invest the majority of your long-term money in ownership vehicles that have appreciation potential, such as stocks, real estate, and your own business. 

* Bogleheads 

* Look at... 

* [Target Retirement Date](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Target_date_funds) funds 

* This types of funds are auto-balanced as you get closer to retirement to decrease risk.  It is far more difficult to select a single stock for investment than leveraging something like this. 

* [Three Index Fund Portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) for Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, etc. 

* ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) from Blackrock, Schwab, Vanguard, State Street, etc. 

* Employer matching funds (guaranteed rate of return) 

* John and Nick's Advice 

* Remember employee stock purchase programs (ESPP) and access to RSU (restricted stock units – vest based on tenure with the company) are investments as well. 

* Putting more money into ESPP is a way to get a greater return down the road for further investment or payment on debt if needed. 

* Diversify your investments.  Investing in stock of only your employer may be too much risk to carry. 

## 36:41 Home Ownership 

* Personal Finance for Dummies

* John and Nick's Advice 

* John's pay as if method 

* Think about the type of down payment needed, what you have, price of house you are targeting, HOA fees, insurance and tax rates 

* Boil down to a monthly payment, and compare with your current rent. 

* If you could make up the difference between the two right now, start saving the difference. 

* If you can't make the payment today, how can you make it when you own the home? 

* Maybe you can't afford to own a home in the area where you live currently.  Is relocating a better financial option? 

## 43:15 When You're Doing Well 

* The sources we gave give advice in these areas too (not to be covered in this episode) 

* College funds 

* Broader insurance coverage 

* Charitable giving 

## 44:03 Closing Thoughts 

* Living debt free allows you to make better career decisions in bad situations (or even in good situations). 

* There are financial workshops out there as well as Dave Ramsey's [Financial Peace University](https://www.daveramsey.com/fpu). 

* Search YouTube for free videos on financial topics. 

* Talk to your mentees about finances to make sure they are making wise decisions.  Not every family teaches this to their children. 

* Credit cards can be like financial cocaine. 

* Promise yourself you will pay down debt and make smart decisions.  This makes your existing take home pay higher and gives you a raise. 

* John learned the "live as if" methodology from his mother.  Maybe it can provide a lesson for you.
