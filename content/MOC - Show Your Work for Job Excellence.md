# MOC - Show Your Work for Job Excellence

## Disclaimer: Sample Bias
The lessons we're seeing are patterns based on interviewing people who have been willing to be interviewed on a podcast. In almost all cases, we're going to have become aware of them by reading their blog posts, watching their presentations, watching their videos, or some other "in public" activity. We just want to acknowledge that.
