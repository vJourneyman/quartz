# Deep Work for High Performance

## Concept Description
More detail on this subject can be found in the book [[Deep Work]] by [[Cal Newport]].

High performance at high-value tasks generally requires blocks of deep, uninterrupted concentration. This is the mark of highly concentrated knowledge work. At the same time, society and employers are making it more easy to interrupt you and putting implicit pressure on individuals to accept interruptions. The path to high performance is to fight to remove interruptions and increase one's ability to deeply concentrate on the task at hand.
