# Paths to Management

## Concept Description
[[Kelly Schroeder]] described the coincidnece of his technology degree being embedded in a school of business, so having to take business related clasess like Accounting, Marketing, etc. That gave him some academic background in business along with the technology education and experience. He discovered in an exposure to a management role that he enjoyed the roles of developing members of his team, making idea and solution connections within the organization, and the hiring process. He started to care less about the implementation details or being the one to carry them out, as long as they were being handled well. [[Episode 58]]

[[Brad Pinkston]] had no inclination to become a manager until he was exposed to management that inspired him. He first stated that, "You don't have to be a manager to lead people." A good organization should have a lot of opportunity to provide leadership and mentorship without being a manager.  [[Management vs. Leadership]] [[Episode 83]]
