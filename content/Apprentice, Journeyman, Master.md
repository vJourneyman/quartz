# Apprentice, Journeyman, Master

## Concept Description
Historical use
	Historical progression from unskilled laborer to professional to master, as practiced in guilds of artisans. Master craftsman "employed" unskilled youths in an indenture-like environment; Minimal pay was provided, but room, board, and training in the craft were the bulk of compensation.
	When an apprentice was judged skilled enough, he was granted journeyman status, which allowed him to travel to other areas and train under other master craftsmen. Eventually, a journeyman could be voted a master by the local guild via money and the production of a masterpiece.
Modern use
	Modern unions and trades still use a similar terminology, though the indentured labor is replaced by pay rates based on third party skill testing. Apprentices are no longer exclusively tied to a single master tradesperson, thus the journeyman designation serves more as a level of professional certification indicating a high skill level.
	**There is also a movement in white collar industries to adopt similar training programs where there hasn't historically been a university degree track for the job area.
