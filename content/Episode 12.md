# Episode 12

Original Recording Date 2018-09-23 

## 2:47 – Effective 1-on-1 Meetings with Your Manager 

-   John stresses the importance of an agenda (to be created 24 hours or more ahead of time) 
    
-   Both parties can contribute to the meeting agenda (manager and employee) 
    
-   Meeting structure suffers without an agenda 
    
-   How many listeners out there have weekly 1-on-1 meetings with their manager?  Let us know on social media! 
    
-   A yearly performance review won't be a surprise if effective weekly 1-on-1 meetings are happening 
    
### What constitutes giving your manager an action item? 
    
-   Don't just bring problems / complaints.  Bring something you need help with and what you have already tried. 
-   Helpful asks – leveraging a manager's experience, leveraging a manager's relationship with other department 
-   Be prepared for feedback from your manager on any request 

## A 1-on-1 meeting is not the same as a project check-in meeting 
    
-   The 1-on-1 is about your professional development / career journey (how to get better) 
	
-   Keep project update meetings separate 
        
##  Career path questions 

^05e048

-   What is the individual contributor career path or management career path for you? 
-   How can you get better at what you are doing? 
-   I have new interests / am requesting new challenges 
-   Pay raises are a separate conversation from career conversations 
   
## Whose job is it to bring up career progression first (yours, your manager's, both)? 
-   In a good company culture, managers should be encouraged to have regular 1-on-1 meetings with direct reports 
-   A manager not bringing this up may just be oversight on his / her part and not intentional 
-   A lack of career progression conversations period could be a lack of organizational maturity 
-   Development of employees could reflect well the manager 

## Cadence for a 1-on-1 should be weekly but bi-weekly at a minimum 
-   Stick to the cadence! 
    
### What are organizational barriers that prevent regular 1-on-1 meetings? 
    
-   Proximity 
	
	-   Manager and employee working in different locations 
		
		-   Manager may have less visibility into employee day-to-day work 
			
	-   Manager and employee working in the same location 
		
		-   More difficult to have a long-term strategy 
			
		-   Talking over the cube wall is usually a project update 
			
-   Managers with large number of reports 
	
	-   Possible indication of lack of managers in the organization 
		
	-   Not scalable for the manager 
		
	-   Could cause infrequent conversations and feedback and frustration for both parties 
		
-   Culture 
	
	-   Are 1-on-1s being encouraged from the top down?

        -   Spiceworks Thread: [Dear SpiceRex: What's my escape route?](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2152547-dear-spicerex-what-s-my-escape-route) 
            
    -   Get your next position before leaving 
        
    -   Don’t bad-mouth people on the way out 
        
        -   Just say you've been happy and it's time to move on 
            
        -   Repeat until they stop asking 
            
        -   Nick reminds us that the things you do on the way out can ruin your reputation at the organization you're leaving 
            
    -   You need buffer cash in case you're walked out the door 
        
        -   What if your new position offer is rescinded 
            
        -   What if your new position's pay day is further away than you thought? 
            
        -   Have an emergency fund of 6 or more months  
            
    -   Assume you'll lose access immediately 
        
    -   Copy reasonably 
        
    -   Prepare a Key Project Report - Transition File 
        
    -   Make lunch appointments with friends and colleagues you want to stay in touch with 
        
-   Manager Tools - What To Do With A Counter Offer 
    
    -   [https://www.manager-tools.com/2011/11/what-do-with-a-counter-offer](https://www.manager-tools.com/2011/11/what-do-with-a-counter-offer) 
        
    -   Don’t take a counter offer! 
        
    -   If you have reasons to leave, will more money really change all the other things? 
        
    -   You're alerting your current employer that you need to be replaced, even if you accept the counter 
        
    -   Ideally you'd leave on your timeline, not your employer's 
        
    -   Taking a counter burns the relationship with the recruiter, hiring manager, and prospective new employer 
        
    -   If it's just money, you should have had a different conversation 
        
    -   If they only give you a raise after you have an offer, that's not a healthy place 
        
    -   If additional compensation was dangled in the past without follow-through, there's no reason to believe they'd follow-through with what's promised in a counter 
        
    -   What if you take the counter and they don't follow through again? 
        
    -   If an employer refuses to give you compensation until the counter-offer 
        
        -   Either calculated that they could get away with not compensating you at the level they valued you 
            
        -   Or they're keeping you in the position short term while they search for your cheaper replacement.
