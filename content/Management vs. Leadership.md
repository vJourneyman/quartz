# Management vs. Leadership

## Concept Description
[[Brad Pinkston]] says, "You don't have to be a manager to be a leader." Leadership is inspiring, teaching, mentoring, coaching, and supporting your colleagues. Management adds the tasks of hiring, firing, performance management and excercise of role power to support the team. A leader might have power from networking and relatinoships, but not role power. A manager may have role power but lack a network and relationships.  [[Episode 58]]

[[Don Jones]] also says that mangement and leadership are two separate things. You can lead as a peer, without being the boss. Managers handle resource allocation, measurement, etc. [[Episode 137]]

[[Scott Lowe]] also re-states the point about leadership being different than management. Part of the leadership task is helping others be more effective in their roles without being their manager. [[Episode 152]]
