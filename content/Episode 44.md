# Episode 44

Welcome to episode 44 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss the one year anniversary of our podcast launch, a review of topics we have covered, and where we plan to go from here. 

* Check out [Nick's one year reflection post](http://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2019/06/30/the-journey-continues-one-year-later/) for more insight on what the past year co-hosting a podcast has been like. 

* Check out [John's one year reflection post](http://vJourneyman.com/one-year-of-podcasting-the-nerd-journey-podcast) for his additional thoughts on the origins and evolution of the podcast. 

Original Recording Date: 06-01-2019 

# Topics – The First Anniversary Review 

## 1:33 – One Year Since Launch! 

* Did you notice the change to the intro? 

* Reflecting on the launch 

* John tells the story of how the podcast came to fruition and how it morphed into having a career-centric focus.  

* This was an attempt to give advice and speak to some of the things we heard others in the industry saying about the need to progress but feeling like they have reached a dead end. 

* Until we stepped out of IT operations, neither of us understood all career path options for those in IT operations. 

* As   John says, when you start doing something, you will definitely be bad at it.  We decided to just start podcasting.  Listen to how many episodes we needed for practice before releasing. 

* Can you find the episode Nick mentioned having "release candidate" mentioned in the intro? 

* The opening has evolved from its humble beginnings.  John discusses specific changes and the reasons for them. 

* Fun Facts  

* The Nerd Journey logo was created by Nick's wife.  What two cities form the skyline in our logo?  Tweet us the answer for a chance to be on the show! 

* The intro and transition music was created by John's wife (who happens to be a musician).   

* In the beginning, we had some concerns. 

* Could we sustain a weekly cadence?   

* John went to local podcast meetup groups for ideas on this.  Would it have been best to release a season at a time? 

* Many of our ideas were the result of life experience and continuing to doing the podcast regularly.

* Interviews 

* The first 12 episodes were just us talking. 

* Preparation for recording was very different when guests were involved. 

## 33:15 – Lessons Learned 

* Nick 

* Carrying a topic on the air is more challenging than he thought.  Preparation is required, and it can't be all improvisation. 

* Being on the podcast has been like taking a master's program in the evenings. 

* Nick is always on the lookout to promote the podcast to different groups and in different circles. 

* John (#shallowjohn) 

* Organization and preparation really does help.  The vast majority of our time is spent coming up with the ideas (brainstorming) and then developing a structure around it. 

* The idea that we could do this on the fly was squashed. 

* Being accountable to someone else was helpful to keep things on track. 

* The process and practice of interviewing people is different than John thought it would be. 

* The nitty gritty of producing a podcast (engineering, editing, etc.) was new to us. 

* There is an endless hole of audio engineering one could pursue, but we went for "good enough." 

## 38:33 - Proposed Topic Report Card 

* Potential future topics we mentioned in previous episodes...did we cover them? 

* Preparing for your next role 

* This one is pretty constant throughout the episodes.

* Mentioned in [Episode 11](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-011-questions-to-ask-in-an-interview-and-hero-complex/)

* Decision to move from individual contributor to being a manager 

* Strategy for using PTO 

* Things we hope to do better 

* Conducting interviews 

* Work on asking focused questions instead of wandering off topic 

* May require studying others and how they handle it 

* Chasing the squirrels brought out some very interesting content we didn't expect 

* Interviewee prep 

* When we ask someone to come on an episode, we need to clearly communicate the thesis of our podcast and the general listening audience.   

*Ask potential guests to give options on some of our most popular topics  

* Resume writing, interviewing (early / late process), 1-1 manager meetings, asking for more money or a promotion, etc.

* We need to help them with their idea for a show through the lens of our thesis. 

* It's on us to help the guests structure their thoughts. 

* We're open to having people share their stories. 

* If we approach you about being on the podcast, don't be nervous.  It's just a conference call with John and me. 

* If you have a podcast topic but don't want to be on the show, please let us know! 

* Listener number goals 

* Should we look to grow from over 100 downloads on the most popular episodes to 1000? 

* Our hope is that the content is relevant and helpful to listeners.
