Joseph Griffiths Interview - Part 1 of 2 

What does a Solution Architect do? 

-   VMware structures it differently than other organizations.  The primary role is to identify business problems and help come up with innovative solutions that solve these problems to ensure a desired outcome. 
    
    -   Example – solving provisioning vs. impact of provisioning on revenue 
        

How does Solution Architect contrast with the Solution Engineer role? 

-   Architect tries to build a solution based on business outcomes 
    
-   Engineer takes specifications from architect and builds them 
    

Time travel with us back to VMworld 2007 

-   Read more on this from Joseph's Blog 
    
-   The discussions on innovation (i.e. private clouds, etc.) opened Joseph's eyes and encouraged him to get outside his comfort zone. 
    
-   He chose to make a pivot to stand out to future employers and started him down a "hyper" path of certifications. 
    
-   Mindset change depends on the person you are. 
    
    -   Everyone has different life experiences and a unique way of looking at the world. 
        
    -   We all need to realize how much we have to learn. 
        
-   Not only were his thoughts about the organization challenged, but he pursued the challenge to make a change. 
    
    -   Joseph immediately became an advocate for implementing a private cloud and found other internal champions. 
        
    -   The efforts failed due to too much focus on technology and not enough focus on people and process, but this set him up for success at the next organization. 
        
-   Did certifications teach valuable career skills? 
    
    -   Yes – it started with [VCP](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification.html) and proceeded to VCAP (separate design and deploy exams, with the design exam being most valuable in learning architectural concepts) 
        
    -   Certifications force you to learn new things and look good on resumes. 
        
    -   See Joseph's [blog post](http://blog.jgriffiths.org/do-it-certifications-really-matter/) on whether IT certifications really matter. 
        
    -   Joseph is a double [VCDX](http://advice%20to%20vcdx%20candidates%20from%20a%20double%20vcdx/). 
        
-   Joseph shares the story of someone intentionally working toward the role of CEO by holding various roles within the company. 
    
-   Joseph switches jobs when he becomes comfortable. 
    
-   Listen to Joseph's taco shell story and its implications to your situation. 
    
    -   Guard against letting what you want becoming what other people want. 
        
-   John draws a parallel between IT's alignment with various internal organizations and its overall value to the company. 
    
    -   When looking at the value of IT, Joseph encourages us to think of this as a journey and stresses the importance of understanding how we got to where we are and how we can fix where we are. 
        
    -   The creation of multiple roles leads to better consistency, more efficiency, and a better product. 
        
    -   This has moved IT workers into siloed teams to the point where they lose touch with the priorities of the business. 
        
    -   The reality of the world is that IT is driving businesses today and can be a competitive advantage. 
        
    -   Joseph points to optimizations and efficiencies in areas which may not provide an impact to the business.  
        
-   Nick draws a parallel to Joseph's automation talk from the Dallas / Fort Worth SpiceCorps in February 2018 (full video [here](https://community.spiceworks.com/meeting/notes/2598)). 
    
    -   Joseph stresses the importance of public speaking for professional development and cites leveraging local user groups and conferences to practice.  Feeling uncomfortable is natural. 
        
    -   Joseph shares an example of process automation in IT and its relationship to business value. 
        
    -   John mentions workers often worry about automating themselves out of a job. 
        
    -   The introduction of automation in the automotive industry actually increased the need for workers. 
        
    -   Employee willingness to adapt and change important. 
        
    -   John gives the example of installing and configuring a software package not being as valuable as other tasks. 
        
-   Joseph goes back to the eye-opening VMworld story.
