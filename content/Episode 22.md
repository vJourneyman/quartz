# Episode 22

Welcome to episode 22 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode, we discuss Nick's 1 Year Check-in at VMware, Part 2. 

Original Recording Date: 2019-1-19 

Topics – Nick's 1 Year Check-in at VMware, Part 2, John's Questions 

========================================================================================================== 

## 4:04 Extracurricular activities 

* How has the new role affected the frequency of and type of engagement in community groups? 

* Nick is still the co-leader of the [DFW SpiceCorps](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps/dallas-fort-worth), a group that has no affiliation with VMware. 

* Attending [VMUGs](https://www.vmug.com/) when possible 

* Presented on vSAN in October 2018 in Dallas (video is [here](http://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2018/10/24/if-vsan-powered-the-matrix-extended-edition/)) 

* Posting in [Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com) and [MangoLassi](https://mangolassi.it/) when possible 

## 6:55 Transitioning from IT operations to Sales 

* Nick was nervous about losing technical skills coming into the role. 

* There are some aspects of IT operations he misses. 

* Meeting with and learning from customers is fun! 

* Are you technical enough?  It depends. 

* Tailoring the technical level of the conversation to the audience is very important. 

* How has carrying a quota affected Nick's honest opinion?  You decide. 

## 13:44 Company culture check 

* In past roles... 

* Most folks in same department in same office 

* Worked with folks in other offices and saw them now and then 

* Current Role 

* First conversations with people (everyone but manager) were via phone / e-mail / chat 

* Face-to-face interaction creates a deeper rapport with co-workers 

* John's aside on [Matrix organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management) 

* Frequent communication is important when working with remote peers 

* Some people may work better when in a face-to-face environment 

## 18:19 Training Pace 

* Nick’s previous employer had a learning platform [Lesson.ly](https://www.lessonly.com/), but it was not as regimented as the quarterly training plans. 

* Some of the training must be done on your own to ensure effectiveness. 

* Online communities can help you stay relevant as can learning from other customers. 

## 20:44 Management 

* Nick wasn’t sure what to expect here and had to get past the “walking into the principal’s office” feeling when a manager calls unexpectedly. 

* The management style is different than it was when Nick was in an operations role. 

* It’s been more like having a coach. 

* Listen to our [episode on effective 1-1s with your manager](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-012-effective-1-on-1-meetings-with-your-manager-and-gracefully-leaving-an-organziation/) 

* Managers can give feedback on things you don’t notice.   

* John describes a manager as someone to guide you on your journey. 

* This was Nick’s first time to work for a manager in a different city.  Consistent 1-1s are key. 

* Still adjusting to the flexibility 

## 25:02 Skills Nick Wishes He Had Coming into the Role 

* Networking – not a routing and switching guy (despite the [NetworkNerd](https://community.spiceworks.com/people/networknerd) community name). 

* Containers – need to be deeper on this  

* Presentations – do more of them, continue  

* Had to ramp on industry-specific regulations 

* Is John moonlighting as a developer? 

* John cites presentation skills as something that needs to be well practiced.  You will be bad at it when you start. 

* Gearing the presentation for a specific audience is much like education.  The ability to pivot at any given moment is something to master. 

## 31:09 Getting Hired was not the First Time Nick Applied at VMware 

* Nick didn’t really know what a SE was for a long time or that it was a potential career path for someone in IT operations. 

* Nick cites the Geek Whisperers episodes about the Silicon Valley VMUG (listen to [this episode](http://geek-whisperers.com/2016/04/geek-whispering-at-the-silicon-valley-vmug-tues-apr-12/) first followed by [this episode](http://geek-whisperers.com/2016/04/investing-in-career-insurance-vmware-user-group-recap-episode-110/)).  Knowing the types of roles that exist as a logical next step from where you are is a helpful first step. 

* Nick’s VMware experience was extremely limited when he applied in 2016.  His experience grew considerably throughout 2017 after a job change at the end of 2016.  Using more of the technology, blogging, and speaking on the technology helped to build a [body of work](http://blog.thenetworknerd.com) someone else could use to evaluate Nick’s experience more than what is merely on a resume. 

## 35:46 Recommendations for others 

* Don’t sell yourself short.  See what jobs exist.   

* Consider your relatable experience. 

* Start building a body of work today.  Use online / in-person communities to help you get there, and include these on your resume. 

* There is no chance to get a job to which you have not applied.  Reach out to peers who do the job you think you want to get their feedback on whether you are qualified.   

* John beats Nick to the punch again!
