# Building a Brand

## Concept Description
[[Brad Pinkston]] notes that part of the process of getting promoted to management (or possibly just promoted in general) is a brand building exercise. Most people have a neutral brand; The people in the interviewing and hiring process have no instinctual response to thinking about that person for a role. Building a positive perception shouldn't be too hard. Decide what you want people to think of when they hear your name. Will they know what your skills and strengths are? Will they know your [[Career Goals|career aspirations]]? If you want them to think something specific (eg. thought leadership), what have you taken on in that area to demonstrate that characteristic? Is it a high enough profile accomplishment? Is it well documented? Do you have [[Sponsors]] mentioning it to others when you're not in the room?
