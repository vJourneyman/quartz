Topics – Nick's 1 Year Check-in at VMware, Part 1 - Nick's Observations 

========================================================================================================== 

## 5:06 – Context And Working From Home 

* Nick went from math teacher to business analyst to IT operations to pre-Sales Engineer.  The observations are meant to be about the transition from operations to pre-Sales more so than to be an advertisement for VMware 

* Adjusting to working from home instead of going to an office every day 

* Coordinating lunch with a homemaker spouse 

* Training children to adjust to a parent working from home can be challenging. 

* Being present at "home" during the day is for work.   

* Listen to Nick's daily routine.  If you work from home, what is yours like? 

* John mentions pre-planning meals as a pro tip. 

* Don't work through lunch.  Put it down while you eat (away from your desk) to have a mental break. 

* Working from home lends itself to working more.  Can it wait until tomorrow? 

* Should the daily routine be strict or flexible? 

* Nick cites exercise classes as a forced work stoppage 

## 14:57 Adjusting to travel 

  * Local, out of state, special functions) 

  * Expense reports were new to this role.  It took practice to make them routine. 

    * John mentions that he uses [Automatic](https://automatic.com/) to track business mileage 

    * Have a system, and stick to it 

    * Consider the aggregation of marginal gains from [Chasing Excellence](https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Excellence-Building-Fittest-Athletes/dp/1619617285) by [Ben Bergeron](https://benbergeron.com/) 

  * Travel to special trainings events can be voluntary 

  * Planning meals and customer visits takes time and effort 

  * Administrative catch up is necessary after travel days 

## 21:36 Expectations coming into the role 

* Read [Nick's blog post](http://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2017/12/04/a-letter-to-the-dreamer-be-brave-enough/) about the process involved in getting the job at VMware 

* Nick was so focused on getting in the door he essentially had no expectations for day 1 

* You can't know all the questions to ask if you have never done the job 

* John and Nick work in different segments and regions even though they have the same title, and their day-to-day experiences are different as a result 

* Control what you can; be prepared for what you cannot control 

* Nick was initially concerned about his product knowledge coming into the role (i.e. not knowing enough to be effective) 

* "Everyone here is as good as or better than you." 

* Saying I don't know is acceptable and can give insight into future areas of personal development 

* John gives an analogy of the general contractor vs. plumbers, electricians, etc.  

* Sitting in on specialized conversations is a way to learn new things 

* Staying on top of new products and releases is challenging 

* Meeting a co-worker who lives in the same area 

* This is a good networking tactic, even if people are outside your immediate / extended team, in a different role, etc. 

* Connections with others inside the organization (whether local or remote) are important to nurture 

* Influence in a field facing role 

* Influence on customers and products 

* Feedback from customers can be passed to product teams to improve the products 

* People in the technology field may be unaware of the various roles at companies that produce and sell a product (i.e. product managers, etc.) 

* John talks through deal registration as it relates to the purchasing process in channel sales
