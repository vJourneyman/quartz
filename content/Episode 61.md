Topics – [[Amy Hervey]] On [[Blogging and Self-Marketing]] [[Episode 60]]

================================================== 

## 03:03 – Thoughts on Blogging 

* People want to want to blog.  It is hard to write something and put it out on the web for all to see.  The fears are real. 

* What if no one notices or reads it? 

* What if I am misunderstood? 

* Amy has supported numerous people that have written for the corporate blog by offering editing, proofreading, and help with search engine optimization.  Sometimes that is the push they need. 

* For those who do not have a blog, LinkedIn is a free platform for publishing articles tied to your profile.   

* This creates a body of work you can point others to later. 

* Don't overcommit to blogging too frequently. 

* Try finding someone / multiple people to hold you accountable for publishing something once per month as a starting point.   

* Tag those accountability partners when you publish and ask for feedback. 

* You can comment on someone else's post at any time. 

* Sharing an article on LinkedIn is good, but write a few sentences to frame your perspective for sharing. 

* John mentions blog posts he has read that are an aggregation of helpful posts and why they were helpful.  This gives insight into how a person thinks, which is really a reflection of their brand. 

* You're not doing this for the kudos. 

## 11:31 – Recommended Reading on Marketing 

* Evaluate your own presence on social media.  Where do you want to be, and why did you choose that platform?  Each one is different, so choose wisely.

## 14:08 - Self Promotion Gone Overboard 

* If you're not having the interactions you want and are not growing your following, something is off.   

* Don't shout a message without engaging with your audience. 

* Some people just repost what their company has posted without ever commenting.  That gives no insight into what the person thinks and why it matters to them.   

* Listen to Amy's analogy on reposting exactly what someone else or a company posted. 

* Use your own expertise and comments to add value when posting something.  Make it an opportunity to start a conversation. 

* Repeating does not imply amplification. 

* Listen to John's reasoning on things that become noise. 

* Misuse of the platform can cause a loss in credibility. 

* Even people with polarizing opinions to whom we can relate keep our attention. 

* Remember you cannot be all things to all people. 

* Can a company or co-workers perceive promotion of personal brand as threatening? 

* They shouldn't. 

* Make it clear that your statements on social media are your own and not on behalf of the company unless otherwise authorized. 

* Publishing an article on your personal blog doesn't mean it represents the opinions of your employer. 

* If there are concerns, talk with leadership about your personal branding. 

## 24:31 - Closing Thoughts 

* Know yourself.  Evaluate your skills, strengths, and weaknesses. 

* Capitalize on strengths. 

* Take the plunge and write an article.  Repeat.  Repeat. 

* Repeat until removal of the byline or logo still allows the audience to identify the work as yours.
