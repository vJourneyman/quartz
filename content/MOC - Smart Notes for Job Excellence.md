# MOC - Smart Notes for Job Excellence

```query
"teaching is understanding"

1) [[Episode 148]] [[Chris Wahl]] mentioned a note-taking system incorporating labels and color-coding to remmeber and find things which reminded John of a Zettelkasten. Everything goes into his notes system because he won't know what's valuable until later. He also describes that writing out concepts forces you to think more deeply about the topic and perhap even improve your understanding of it, structurally and contextually.
2) [[Episode 156]] [[Episode 157]] [[Josh Duffney]] links Zettelkasten with Deep Work. He was so inspired that he wrote a short book about implementing the system in Obsidian.
3) [[Episode 172]] [[Evan Oldford]] commented on the intensity of the notes that went into reading Deep Work. That was done using the Smart Notes methodology. We built the episodes by reacting to literature notes John wrote.
4) [[Episode 178]] [[Stephanie Wong]] discussed how real learning comes from not just reading something, but retrieving the information, processing it, and teaching it back to others. Smart Notes are exactly this process, where the first student is the future you.
5) [[Episode 186]] [[Phil Monk]] described the memory palace technique, which reminds John of the spacial or graph view of a Zettelkasten.
