# Bonus Episode 10

Welcome to bonus episode #10 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss how to support colleagues of color during these turbulent times.

Topics – How To Support Colleagues of Color [[Allyship]]

=========================================== 

We’re experiencing a time of social upheaval and [protest in the aftermath of the police killings of George Floyd ]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests)) and [Breonna Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Breonna_Taylor) among others. So what can we do to support our colleagues of color who might feel especially burdened? 

## 5:19 Do’s and Don’ts 

* General guidance: Invest in your relationships ahead of time 

* John gives the example of he and Nick being able to support each other through losing parents because they had invested in their relationships ahead of time. 

* Don’ts 

* Don’t add to their burdens 

* Don’t ask your colleagues to explain the why’s of the situation to you 

* Don’t ask them to support you emotionally 

* Don’t wait to be an ally 

* Speak out against racial and gender bias immediately  

* It’s the other person who made it awkward;  

* Nick references [Crucial Conversation’s](https://www.vitalsmarts.com/resource/crucial-conversations-book/) notion of safety in conversations [[Crucial Conversations]]

* Be able to receive a critique as well if the person being called out is you. This is a very difficult thing to do, but important for growth. 

* Do 

* Offer Support 

* Maybe let them know your offer of support doesn’t require a response as you offer it 

* Offer Allyship 

* Perhaps join an employee resource group as an ally 

* Is this kind of conversation more loaded if there’s a manager-report relationship? 

* For peers, there’s no explicit power dynamic 

* It’s important for managers to have created a safe space to discuss a variety of issues (race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, mental health, parental status) 

* Managers _should_ have more training to be a source of support for difficult topics 

* If managers have only positioned themselves only as a point of accountability, then they’ve made a mistake. 

* Nick is reminded of [Fierce Conversations](https://fierceinc.com/fierce-conversations) guidance to interrogate reality [[Fierce Conversations]]

## 21:29 Context on the State of Race Relations 

* Context on the Context 

* John’s goal is to provide context that you might not have, not sound preachy or accusatory 

* We’re also linking to additional resources 

* 23:24 The [murder of George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd)is outrageous, but not an isolated/new occurrence [[George Floyd]] [[Black Lives Matter Protests]]

* African-Americans live with the reality that they could be killed by the police all the time 

* [The Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_talk_(parenting)) [[The Talk]]

* The [murder of Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile) happened in the suburbs of St. Paul Minnesota in 2016. [[Philando Castile]]

* The [murder of Michael Brown]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown)) in 2014 in Ferguson, MO [[Michael Brown]]

* [Covid-19 is disproportionately affecting African Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html) [[COVID-19]]

* 30:37 The hypocrisy of identifying violence and looting as the problem: America opposes non-violent protest 

* [FBI COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO) illegal surveillance and disruption of the Civil Rights movement [[COINTELPRO]]

* The [Civil Rights Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement) was a movement was met with violence and mass incarceration [[Civil Rights Movement]]

* The modern [US National Anthem protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick) were met with  [[National Anthem Protests]]

* [Drew Brees](https://www.espn.com/blog/new-orleans-saints/post/_/id/23063/drew-brees-wholeheartedly-disagrees-with-colin-kaepernicks-method-of-protest) opposed non-violent protest in 2016; [Drew Brees’s opposition to kneeling as non-violent protest was unchanged in 2020](https://twitter.com/YahooFinance/status/1268206174073126915) until it wasn’t. [[Drew Brees]]

* Nick wonders if people are quicker to be offended with what we think people mean instead of asking. 

* John finds that difficult to believe; It feels as if it’s intentionally misunderstanding the protest, perhaps as a defense against facing the difficult issue of police brutality. Or maybe it’s just racism. Or maybe people can’t just back off their statements. 

* 39:14 [Video Montage of Police Brutality at Protests Against Police Brutality]([https://youtu.be/iGxfNl9C6CQ?t=2804](https://youtu.be/iGxfNl9C6CQ?t=2804)) [[Police Brutality]]

Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength."

## 1:00:53 Brief Explanation of “[[Defund the Police]]” 

* Misconception is that it’s calling for completely disbanding the police 

* Many poor African-American neighborhoods have such poor response times and experience with the police that they are effectively unpoliced 

* Main policy goal is to disaggregate the many functions served by the police department and fund them in separate organizations 

* Mental health intervention by specially trained teams 

* Homeless services to transition and serve that population 

* Community safety 

* etc 

* We’ve had most of two centuries to reform the police force 

* [[Marketplace Podcast]]: [What it means to defund police]([https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0cGxhY2Uub3JnL2ZlZWQvcG9kY2FzdC9tYXJrZXRwbGFjZQ/episode/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0cGxhY2Uub3JnL3Nob3dzL21hcmtldHBsYWNlL3doYXQtaXQtbWVhbnMtdG8tZGVmdW5kLXBvbGljZQ?hl=en&ep=6](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0cGxhY2Uub3JnL2ZlZWQvcG9kY2FzdC9tYXJrZXRwbGFjZQ/episode/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0cGxhY2Uub3JnL3Nob3dzL21hcmtldHBsYWNlL3doYXQtaXQtbWVhbnMtdG8tZGVmdW5kLXBvbGljZQ?hl=en&ep=6)) 

* The vast majority of police department calls have nothing to do with a major uniform crime (from context, [UCR Part 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Crime_Reports#UCR_crime_categories) crimes:  Aggravated assault, forcible rape, murder, robbery, arson, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft) 

* Mostly auto accidents, noise complaints, substance abuse issues, and mental health issues 

* NPR Throughline: [American Police](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/03/869046127/american-police) 

* “...Tension between African American communities and the police has existed for centuries. This week, the origins of American policing and how those origins put violent control of Black Americans at the heart of the system.” 

* [The End of Policing](https://www.versobooks.com/books/2426-the-end-of-policing) by [[Alex S. Vitale]] [[The End of Policing]] 

* “This book attempts to spark public discussion by revealing the tainted origins of modern policing as a tool of social control. It shows how the expansion of police authority is inconsistent with community empowerment, social justice—even public safety. Drawing on groundbreaking research from across the world, and covering virtually every area in the increasingly broad range of police work, Alex Vitale demonstrates how law enforcement has come to exacerbate the very problems it is supposed to solve.” 

* [[NPR Planet Money]]: [Police Unions And Police Violence](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/05/871298161/police-unions-and-police-violence) 

* “Police unions are a bit different from other unions. Normally, unions exist to empower workers through collective action. Police already have a kind of power other workers don't. Today, we look at the data on police unions how their very existence might lead to more people being killed by police. Also, why other unions are distancing themselves from police unions.” 

* After officers gain access to collective bargaining rights, there was a “substantial increase” in killing of civilians, almost all of whom are non-white. 

## 1:04:23 Wrapping Up 

* The conversation was difficult to record 

* Hopefully this helps you understand some of the context 

* We don’t all have to agree on every point, hopefully just understand each other a bit better 

* It’s also difficult to offer support when we might be close to our own emotional limits 

* We hope this was easier to listen to than it was to record! 

* We hope you’re all in a good place and getting the support you need
