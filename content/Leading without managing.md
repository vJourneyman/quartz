# Leading without managing

## Concept Description
While leadership and managmenet are terms that often get used interchangably, they're not the same thing. Leadership is acting to inspire others, helping others grow, or providing support for others.

Leadership can help gain [[relationship power]]. 

Management is a job role tasked with managing resources, performance, hiring, and firing of a team.

Managers implicitly have [[role power]] over their direct reports.

Good managers will also provide leadership. But not all leadership needs to come from managers.
