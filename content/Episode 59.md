# Episode 59

Welcome to episode 59 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we have part 2 of an interview with Kelly Schroeder about the technical management career and advice for the would-be manager.

Topics – Kelly Schroeder Interview [[Kelly Schroeder]] [[Episode 58]]

=================================== 

## 02:19 – Kelly's Current Role as a Manager - Observations and Lessons 

* How is this role different than his previous positions? 

* The organization is a different scale with over 2000 employees.  The IT Department is 80 people, and Kelly has 15 people under him (2 supervisors and 4 direct reports). 

* This is wildly different than what he has done in the past.  With a team this large, he cannot do anything technical (no room to fit into his day). 

* Kelly was hired into this job to replace someone on the way out.  He replaced a quality person who had built a great team and considers himself of a maintainer than a builder. 

* Kelly realized the person he was replacing had truly cared about the wellbeing of her team.  She understood them, knew them on a personal level, and helped shape them to be better people. 

* John mentioned some of the great managers he's had exhibited the same qualities. 

* At Kelly's level, he can know all the people on his team and interact with everyone.   

* Even though he manages managers today, the fundamental principle of caring for his people does not change. 

* If he was a level or two higher and over a larger team the connection with each person would not be feasible. 

* We're not sure how more senior level leaders handle this, but maybe we need to have one on the show. 

* When managing managers, Kelly can set an expectation / vision and ask managers to communicate to their teams, but it's extremely difficult to step back and avoid micromanagement. 

* John shares a fun anecdote about how to properly raise a flag in the military. 

* 12:44 – John White School of Mentoring Plug 

* Pulling back from micromanagement comes down to respect. 

* It feels disrespectful for him to do someone else's job.  When he gets the urge, he thinks about the way he would want to be treated and changes course. 

* Is managing like parenting?  Listen to Kelly give some great advice here. 

## 16:02 – Advice for the Would Be Manager 

* Know what your leadership looks like.   

* Some feel leadership looks like a charismatic leader of a large organization (Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc.).  Because of this misconception, Kelly originally doubted his ability to be a leader. 

* Kelly took a [StrengthsFinder](https://www.gallup.com/press/176429/strengthsfinder.aspx) training and realized he could leverage his relational strengths to lead instead of trying to be like someone who he thinks is a leader. 

* The StrengthsFinder assessment is just another personality assessment that focuses specifically on your strengths rather than on what you lack. 

* The episodes on management with [[Charlie Nichol]] inspired Kelly to share his perspective with our listeners of coming from the SMB world.        

* [Episode 51](http://nerd-journey.com/individual-contributor-to-manager-with-charlie-nichol-pt-1/) [[Episode 51]]

* [Episode 52](http://nerd-journey.com/considering-a-management-career-and-learning-to-develop-teams-with-charlie-nichol-pt-2/) [[Episode 52]]

* Final thoughts... 

* For those in IT and introverted...everyone has the potential to be a leader in some way. 

* Leading is mostly about ownership and vision, which you can have over your own responsibilities as an individual contributor. 

* Don't be a afraid of your ability to influence others. 

* There are career paths for individual contributors to remain non-managers but still be in leadership roles.  Lack of a role like this in your organization may be a sign it is time to make a move to a larger company.
