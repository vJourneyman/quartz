20:35 - The Ins and Outs of Training...Revisited 

-   This started from a conversation between Nick and John on personal training plans. 
    
-   We gave some ideas on the "what" aspect of training in episode 6 (need to add a link here) but did not address adjacencies. 
    

-   What is an adjacency? 
    
    -   An area outside of your main focus 
        
-   Nick shares some examples of adjacent areas under the IT umbrella. 
    

-   Why are adjacencies important? 
    
    -   Know what is important in the adjacent areas that affect your core competency. 
        
    -   Knowledge of adjacencies can build rapport between teams. 
        
    -   Customer example – a member of the development team moved to operations to help improve processes and better support developers. 
        

-   What if you get really interested in an adjacent area? 
    
    -   An adjacency that's interesting enough could eventually be a specialty. 
        
    -   Dip a toe into another area without leaving where you're comfortable. 
        
    -   Knowledge of other disciplines makes you more valuable and better able to support other teams. 
        
    -   John says "take their job now." 
        
    
-   Ideas on "How" to train for adjacencies 
    
    -   Leverage specialist teams to cross-train other teams to a baseline level of knowledge.   
        
    -   Train to understand the areas of concern in adjacent disciplines. 
        
    
-   Ideas for "What" 
    
    -   We talked about technical adjacencies earlier in this segment, but what about the non-technical adjacencies? 
        
    -   John stresses the importance for technical people to understand how Sales organizations think and operate. 
        
    
    -   Understanding how your boss is being measured helps with prioritization alignment. 
        
    -   Train on concerns of business executives to better position and get funding for IT projects. 
        
        -   revenue 
            
        -   expenses 
            
        -   risk 
            
        -   time to market 
            
        -   quality of service 
            
        -   Networking 
            
    -   Individual contributors can learn about managerial skills. 
        
        -   Helps in getting hired later 
            
        -   Or promoted in place 
            
        -   Or hired diagonally within the organization 
            
        -   Understand how performance is measured 
            
    -   Most people think about training for certifications or in another area under the IT umbrella.
