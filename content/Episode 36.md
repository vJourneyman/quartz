Topics – Customer Advocacy Programs 

===================================== 

## 2:43 What are customer advocacy programs and their benefits? 

* What are they, exactly? 

* The idea is a vendor has created a program that incentivizes customer to be highly engaged advocates of the solution. 

* This is not to be confused with customer advocate roles within a vendor. 

* This is part of the arm of a vendor's marketing organization. 

* John never thought of customer advocacy programs as advocacy programs. 

* What is the benefit to the vendor? 

* Customers become advocates for the product / solution. 

* The vendor is promoting and gets valuable thought leadership. 

* People are way more influenced by their peers than by any other avenue. 

* Social media widens the reach of the vendor. 

* Advocates can re-broadcast company content. 

* Vendors can get qualified feedback on things not working well as it relates to the product. 

* What are the benefits to the participant? 

* The participant's employer gets free marketing exposure out of it (speaking at conferences, etc.). 

* The employer has industry thought leadership because the participant is on staff. 

* Free software is often a benefit. 

* Access to technical vendor resources is more intimate to allow feedback / a greater influence on product features. 

* Special briefing programs / advanced information / beta program 

* Nick tells the story of beta testing [Arctic Wolf]([https://arcticwolf.com/](https://arcticwolf.com/)) and later becoming an early adopter. 

## 14:33 Downsides to Participation 

* Being a member of a vendor's customer advocacy program may be perceived as being biased by the vendor's technology vision. 

* Isn't making a recommendation to someone else about a product the same as being an advocate? 

* There may be a perceived pressure to contribute in the program. 

* Is feedback on products or a certain time commitment expected? 

* Lack of participation in some form will likely lead to not being part of the program in the future. 

* It's free sales and marketing for the vendor, and people may want to shy away from that. 

* John weighs in on IT professionals and popular opinions on interacting with sales and marketing organizations. 

* Are we (John and Nick) biased toward advocacy programs because we work for a vendor? 

## 19:34 Qualification Process and Popular Programs 

* Normally  people have to apply to be a part of the program and show evidence of technical prowess and participation in the proper areas. 

* Blogging, podcasting, and community participation (speaking engagement, online forums) are seen as helpful evidences.  [[Show Your Work]]

* The designation of being part of the program is for a specific period of time and will require re-applying at a later time. 

* As your career changes, it may make sense to no longer participate in a specific advocacy program. 

* Popular Programs 

* [Cisco Champions](https://blogs.cisco.com/perspectives/cisco-champions-2019-applications-now-open)

* [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/pages/what-it-takes-to-be-an-mvp)

* [Nutanix](https://next.nutanix.com/blog-40/welcome-to-the-2019-nutanix-technology-champions-ntc-31459) 

* [MongoDB](https://upshotstories.com/stories/why-joining-mongodb-s-advocate-community-has-been-the-best-career-choice-of-my-life) 

* [Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/)!!!  

* Local user-advocates were given the chance to speak to companies thinking about advertising inside the product. 

* John mentions [Influitive](https://influitive.com/), a vendor that helps companies create and develop advocacy programs. 

## 27:38 Career Benefits of Advocacy Programs [[Community Participation for Career Advancement]]

* Use the program as you like.  The choice is yours. 

* There is a tight network of people in these advocacy programs, and this can be leveraged to broaden your network of peers. 

* Definitely put customer advocacy programs on your resume! 

* Designation as a technical expert from a vendor gives a different way for future employers to evaluate you (that can be verified). 

* Tinkering with free software for home use can help you learn skills to get to the next level (learning a new technology, moving into an adjacency, etc.). 

* The qualifications for advocacy programs act as a roadmap for furthering your career. 

* Even without the designation, the participation in community is key to advancement. 

* Are advocacy programs just for customers? 

* Vendor employees can take part in these programs depending on the vendor. 

* There may be separate advocacy programs just for employees separate and apart from the customer advocacy program. 

* Taking part in these programs as an insider can bring a fresh perspective to the organization.
