Topics – Preparing for Unexpected Career Opportunities, Part 4 

=============================================================================================================================================== 

## 1:53 – A Review of the Series to Date 

* Go back and listen if you missed these episodes... 

* [Part 1 - Preparation](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-1/) 

* [Part 2 - Contact](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-2/) 

* [Part 3 - Agreeing to a Discussion](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-3-agreeing-to-discuss-opportunities/) 

## 2:20 - Decision Time 

* An offer letter is an official document describing terms of employment (with compensation package) for the potential employee to sign. 

* Likely you do not want to make a company put this together unless you're considering taking the offer. 

* John mentions the decision point should likely come before you receive an offer letter. 

* 4:20 Review of questions to ask yourself during the process  

* Is this opportunity interesting enough to keep pursuing? 

* Am I interested in what the company is doing / the products it has, etc.? 

* Have I become more interested as a result of going through the process? 

* If at any point during the interview process you became disinterested, politely end the process. 

* Did you rank your priorities (money, travel, flexible schedule, area, support for family life, etc.)?   

* What is most important to you that would motivate you to make a change?   

* What tradeoffs would you be willing to make? 

* Review podcasts on reasons not to pursue an opportunity 

* [Episode 16 - Before Applying](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-016-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-1-before-applying/) 

* [Episode 17 - During Interviews or After the Offer](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-017-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-part-2-2-during-interviews-and-after-the-offer/) 

* 11:58 The company making you an offer has to sell you on making the change.  It should be a better match to your priorities than you have today. 

* Don't forget to consider how the change will affect your family (spouse, children, etc.).   

* Nick and John share anecdotes on being in close proximity to family. 

* 16:22 Should you leverage the offer for a raise at your current company, even if you are thinking about taking the job? 

* Again, the answer is likely no. 

* If this offer has exposed gaps at your current company, ask your employer to address them without posing the threat of leaving. 

* A perception of one foot out the door could be created. 

* 18:19 What if you turn down the offer? 

* Maintain professionalism no matter what. 

* Maybe the company making the offer just cannot meet your needs. 

* The art of saying no requires practice and can be difficult. 

* 20:29 What if you take the offer? 

* How soon should you let your current employer know you plan to leave?  What about navigating wait time for a background check process? 

* Ensure you capture ALL steps that need to happen before coming an employee at the new company.   

* Some companies may do a background check before an offer.  Others may do it after that step. 

* Whatever notice you give to your employer needs to be after the go / no go point (all parts of process complete to be an employee at the new company). 

* Two weeks is customary notice when leaving an organization.  More may be needed in certain scenarios. 

* There is a possibility your last day will be the day you give notice.  It doesn't hurt to ask the new employer if you can start early if this happens. 

* Are you financially ready for a gap in pay if that happens? 

* 28:13 Ensuring a great transition 

* Go back and listen to [Episode 12](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-012-effective-1-on-1-meetings-with-your-manager-and-gracefully-leaving-an-organziation/) on gracefully leaving an organization for additional tips. 

* John shares a story about a colleague who helped him transition into some accounts as a SE and what he wanted a successful transition to look like when leaving VMware. 

* Make it a point to keep in touch with former colleagues. 

* Disseminating the fact that you are leaving is up to your manager.   

* Be courteous about this, but let him / her know you would like your colleagues to know before your last day. 

* Is there something we missed in this series?  Please let us know by sending a Tweet or message on LinkedIn.
