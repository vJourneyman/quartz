Master craftsman \"employed\" unskilled youths in an indenture-like environment; Minimal pay was provided, but room, board, and training in the craft were the bulk of compensation.\n\tWhen an apprentice was judged skilled enough, he was granted journeyman status, which allowed him to travel to other areas and train under other master craftsmen. Eventually, a journeyman could be voted a master by the local guild via money and the production of a masterpiece.\nModern use\n\tModern unions and trades still use a similar terminology, though the indentured labor is replaced by pay rates based on third party skill testing. Apprentices are no longer exclusively tied to a single master tradesperson, thus the journeyman designation serves more as a level of professional certification indicating a high skill level.\n\t**There is also a movement in white collar industries to adopt similar training programs where there hasn't historically been a university degree track for the job area.\n\t\n\t\n## Related To\n[[Certification]]\n[[Career Progression]]\n\t\n## Bibliography\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild#Organization\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship_in_the_United_States#White-Collar_Apprenticeships\n[[Episode 138]] [[[Don Jones]]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.01858871Z","tags":null},"/Atomic-Habits":{"title":"Atomic Habits","content":"\n![cover|150](http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XfFvDwAAQBAJ\u0026printsec=frontcover\u0026img=1\u0026zoom=1\u0026edge=curl\u0026source=gbs_api)\n# Atomic Habits\n## Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results\n\n### Author\n[[James Clear]]\n\n### Cover\nhttp://books.google.com/books/content?id=XfFvDwAAQBAJ\u0026printsec=frontcover\u0026img=1\u0026zoom=1\u0026edge=curl\u0026source=gbs_api\n\n### Amazon Link\n\n\n### Website\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.01858871Z","tags":null},"/Barriers-to-Effective-Feedback-Conversation":{"title":"Barriers to Effective Feedback Conversation","content":"\n# Barriers to Effective Feedback Conversation\n## Subtitle\n\n### Author\n\n### Amazon Link\n\t\n### Website\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.01858871Z","tags":null},"/Behind-the-Bastards":{"title":"Behind the Bastards","content":"\n# Behind the Bastards\n\n### Host(s)\n[[Robert Evans]]\n\n### Feed Link\n\n### Website\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.01858871Z","tags":null},"/Ben-Bergeron":{"title":"Ben Bergeron","content":"\n# Ben Bergeron\n\n### Title\nAuthor\n\n### Company\n\n\n### LinkedIn URL\n\n\n### Twitter\n\n\n### Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.01858871Z","tags":null},"/Bill-Kindle":{"title":"Bill Kindle","content":"\n# Bill Kindle\n\n### Title\n\n\n### Company\n\n\n### LinkedIn URL\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/billkindle/\n\n\n### Twitter\n\n\n### Website\nhttps://adamtheautomator.com/author/bill/\nhttps://4sysops.com/members/bill-kindle/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.01858871Z","tags":null},"/Blake-Johnson":{"title":"Blake Johnson","content":"\n# Blake Johnson\n\n### Title\nOwner\n\n### Company\n[[Manifest Fit]]\n\n### LinkedIn URL\n\n\n### Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/vivalablake\n\n\n## Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/vivalablake/\n\n\n### Website\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/blake-johnson-104367104/\n\n\n### Blurb\nOwner of Manifest Fit and also a sales associate at a car dealership.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.01858871Z","tags":null},"/Bonus-Episode-1":{"title":"Bonus Episode 1","content":"\n# Bonus Episode 1\n\nTopics \n\n2:10 VMworld 2018 Experiences \n\n-   Customer experience vs Employee experience \n    \n    -

In today's episode we discuss how to support colleagues of color during these turbulent times.  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-06-2020 \n\nTopics – How To Support Colleagues of Color [[Allyship]]\n\n=========================================== \n\nWe’re experiencing a time of social upheaval and [protest in the aftermath of the police killings of George Floyd ]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests)) and [Breonna Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Breonna_Taylor) among others. So what can we do to support our colleagues of color who might feel especially burdened? \n\n## 5:19 Do’s and Don’ts \n\n* General guidance: Invest in your relationships ahead of time \n\n* John gives the example of he and Nick being able to support each other through losing parents because they had invested in their relationships ahead of time. \n\n* Don’ts \n\n* Don’t add to their burdens \n\n* Don’t ask your colleagues to explain the why’s of the situation to you \n\n* Don’t ask them to support you emotionally \n\n* Don’t wait to be an ally \n\n* Speak out against racial and gender bias immediately  \n\n* It’s the other person who made it awkward;  \n\n* Nick references [Crucial Conversation’s](https://www.vitalsmarts.com/resource/crucial-conversations-book/) notion of safety in conversations [[Crucial Conversations]]\n\n* Be able to receive a critique as well if the person being called out is you. This is a very difficult thing to do, but important for growth. \n\n* Do \n\n* Offer Support \n\n* Maybe let them know your offer of support doesn’t require a response as you offer it \n\n* Offer Allyship \n\n* Perhaps join an employee resource group as an ally \n\n* Is this kind of conversation more loaded if there’s a manager-report relationship? \n\n* For peers, there’s no explicit power dynamic \n\n* It’s important for managers to have created a safe space to discuss a variety of issues (race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, mental health, parental status) \n\n* Managers _should_ have more training to be a source of support for difficult topics \n\n* If managers have only positioned themselves only as a point of accountability, then they’ve made a mistake. \n\n* Nick is reminded of [Fierce Conversations](https://fierceinc.com/fierce-conversations) guidance to interrogate reality [[Fierce Conversations]]\n\n## 21:29 Context on the State of Race Relations \n\n* Context on the Context \n\n* John’s goal is to provide context that you might not have, not sound preachy or accusatory \n\n* We’re also linking to additional resources \n\n* 23:24 The [murder of George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd)is outrageous, but not an isolated/new occurrence [[George Floyd]] [[Black Lives Matter Protests]]\n\n* African-Americans live with the reality that they could be killed by the police all the time \n\n* [The Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_talk_(parenting)) [[The Talk]]\n\n* The [murder of Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile) happened in the suburbs of St. Paul Minnesota in 2016. [[Philando Castile]]\n\n* The [murder of Michael Brown]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown)) in 2014 in Ferguson, MO [[Michael Brown]]\n\n* [Covid-19 is disproportionately affecting African Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html) [[COVID-19]]\n\n* 27:50 The Prison system disproportionately affects the African American community \n\n* [13th on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfcq5pF8u8) [[13th]]\n\n* [The New Jim Crow](https://newjimcrow.com/) [[New Jim Crow]]\n\n* 30:37 The hypocrisy of identifying violence and looting as the problem: America opposes non-violent protest \n\n* [FBI COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO) illegal surveillance and disruption of the Civil Rights movement [[COINTELPRO]]\n\n* The [Civil Rights Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement) was a movement was met with violence and mass incarceration [[Civil Rights Movement]]\n\n* The modern [US National Anthem protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick) were met with  [[National Anthem Protests]]\n\n* [Drew Brees](https://www.espn.com/blog/new-orleans-saints/post/_/id/23063/drew-brees-wholeheartedly-disagrees-with-colin-kaepernicks-method-of-protest) opposed non-violent protest in 2016; [Drew Brees’s opposition to kneeling as non-violent protest was unchanged in 2020](https://twitter.com/YahooFinance/status/1268206174073126915) until it wasn’t. [[Drew Brees]]\n\n* Nick wonders if people are quicker to be offended with what we think people mean instead of asking. \n\n* John finds that difficult to believe; It feels as if it’s intentionally misunderstanding the protest, perhaps as a defense against facing the difficult issue of police brutality. Or maybe it’s just racism. Or maybe people can’t just back off their statements. \n\n* 39:14 [Video Montage of Police Brutality at Protests Against Police Brutality]([https://youtu.be/iGxfNl9C6CQ?t=2804](https://youtu.be/iGxfNl9C6CQ?t=2804)) [[Police Brutality]]\n\n* Entire episode of [Some More News]([https://youtu.be/iGxfNl9C6CQ](https://youtu.be/iGxfNl9C6CQ)) [[Some More News]]\n\n* Violence at protests seems mostly done by police, not protesters \n\n* Scary statements from our political leaders \n\n* 41:55 The problem with the President of the United States saying, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” \n\n* [History of the phrase](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/05/29/when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts-trump-walter-headley/) \n\n* [The President threatens military action against the American civilian population](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/01/politics/donald-trump-national-address-race/index.html) \n\n* [[Tom Cotton]]’s “[No quarter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/04/tom-cottons-ugly-screed-hints-terrible-backlash-come/)” statement \n\n* [De Blasio Defends NYPD Officers Who Drove Into Demonstrators]([https://gothamist.com/news/de-blasio-defends-nypd-officers-who-drove-demonstrators](https://gothamist.com/news/de-blasio-defends-nypd-officers-who-drove-demonstrators)) [[Bill De Blasio]]\n\n* [Joe Biden’s history authoring the war on drugs](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/25/18282870/joe-biden-criminal-justice-war-on-drugs-mass-incarceration) including the [Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986) [[Joe BIden]]  \n\n* 100:1 sentencing ratio of crack to powder cocaine \n\n* Had the effect of treating black offenders more harshly than white offenders \n\n## 48:59 [[Revisionist History]] Presents: The Limits of Power \n\n* Listen At \n\n* [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revisionist-history-presents-the-limits-of-power/id1119389968?i=1000476517088) \n\n* [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmZlZWRidXJuZXIuY29tL1JldmlzaW9uaXN0SGlzdG9yeQ/episode/YTg4ZGExZmUtYTQ2Ni0xMWVhLTg1MTAtMTNmMGMwYzQ3ZmE1?ved=0CAkQzsICahcKEwiYrpjXtu7pAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ) \n\n* [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Wa7kdgXNl8ChF8UdDLze6) \n\n* [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/pushkin-industries/revisionist-history/e/70106575) \n\n* The British Army sought to bring order to the streets of Northern Ireland by making the cost of protest (that's a euphemism for police violence and mass incarceration) so high that people would logically not protest.

In today's episode we have a contemporaneous discussion of our experiences at VMworld 2019 in San Francisco.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 08-29-2019 \n\nJohn mentions the post-VMworld interview he did with Ramzi Marjaba of We the Sales Engineers [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poNOEmldS9k\u0026t=4s) or [audio](https://wethesalesengineers.com/preparing-for-customer-conferences/).  \n\nTopics – Sharing Experiences at VMworld US 2019 \n\n=============================================== \n\n## 4:20 Opening Banter \n\n* John comments on this being our second take on recording. \n\n## 5:55 How has the show been? \n\n* Nick didn't go to many evening events, especially those where it is too loud to have a conversation. \n\n* Nick and John were at the vExpert party on one of the events (a quieter event) and had some great conversations. \n\n* Neither of us has reached [Al Rasheed]([https://twitter.com/al_rasheed?lang=en](https://twitter.com/al_rasheed?lang=en))'s level of professional networking capabilities. \n\n* We met [Brian Trainor]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/briantrainor/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briantrainor/)) and [Chris Schott]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-schott-57b453103/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-schott-57b453103/)) and had some great conversations. \n\n* Most of the people we met at the conference were there to... \n\n* Attend keynotes, some sessions, and check out the solutions exchange \n\n* The people in the vCommunity / vBrownBag area placed a much higher priority on networking than the average attendee.  This kind of priority is a career accelerator. \n\n* Nick thinks many people come to conferences to look for jobs (even though you may not know it). \n\n* Once you have career advancement on your mind, it never really leaves your mind.  John makes it a point to visit with other people inside his own company he might not otherwise meet. \n\n* 11:43 Vendor Expo \n\n* Nick spent the better part of an afternoon walking around the solutions exchange.  He enjoys learning about new vendors, the markets in which they play, and the problems they solve. \n\n* If you are part of a [VMUG](https://www.vmug.com/), point your local VMUG leaders to interesting vendors for potential meeting sponsorship. \n\n* Nick's pitch to new, interesting vendors is to sell them on [SpiceCorps]([https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps)) sponsorship. \n\n* Nick ran into Ian Eyberg, CEO of [NanoVMs]([https://nanovms.com/](https://nanovms.com/)).  Nick had heard him on [Datanauts Podcast # 54]([https://packetpushers.net/podcast/bib-054-create-deploy-unikernels-with-nanovms/](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/bib-054-create-deploy-unikernels-with-nanovms/)) discussing Unikernels. \n\n* Are you talking with vendors when attending a conference?  If not, you may handicapping yourself at a later time. \n\n* John doesn't take much vendor swag at trade shows these days. \n\n* Nick carried his full laptop around the show but would set it down on the ground when talking with someone in the solutions exchange.  Many people go tablet or with just their phone to lighten the load on their back. \n\n## 17:26 Sessions \n\n* Nick and John were only able to attend 2 sessions each on the final day.  When you work for the vendor putting on the conference, your time is not your own. \n\n* The recorder battery ran out. \n\n## 19:25 Presentations – following up on [Episode 41](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-041-presentations/) \n\n* John \n\n* Check out John's VMworld session \"Save the IT Department: Add the Development Platform to Your Portfolio\" [video](https://videos.vmworld.com/global/2019/videoplayer/28263) and [slide deck](https://cms.vmworldonline.com/event_data/12/session_notes/CODE3333U.pdf).   \n\n* [This is where John's SpiceWorld 2013 presentation used to be](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/446548-smb-storage-right-way-wrong-way-spicy-way-spiceworld-2013). \n\n* It was a 30 minute session, and John had to submit his slides several weeks in advance of the presentation. \n\n* John recommends running through the slide deck you will use a few times in advance to make sure it flows well. \n\n* John had people ask questions after the session was over.   \n\n* Should John post his presentation video and tag it #ForTheGlory? \n\n* How many new followers did John get as a result of the presentation? \n\n* Nick   \n\n* He did a 12-minute vBrownBag talk this year. \n\n* In both scenarios, you are using a computer that is not your own. \n\n* Nick tried to put minimal speaker notes in his presentation but ended up not being able to see any notes while giving the presentation (oops). \n\n* Nick practiced a couple of times to ensure his presentation fit inside the time period (did not want it to be too long). \n\n* Sometimes when presenting, he gets ideas he had not thought of while preparing the presentation.  Does that happen to you? \n\n* Nick cites a very good presentation by Joseph Griffiths on [Removing Operational Debt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfU5IGET4nY).  The presentation was mostly pictures, but Joseph had a backup copy of his speaker notes just in case. \n\n## 28:34 Would attending a conference where no one knows you make for a new and interesting experience? \n\n* Nick recently attended [DevOps Days Dallas]([https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-dallas/welcome/](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-dallas/welcome/)) and manned a booth for part of the time.   \n\n* Nick comments on what working the booth was like and the interesting conversations he had. \n\n* The DevOps Days Dallas video play list can be found [here]([https://www.youtube.com/c/DevOpsDaysDFW/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/c/DevOpsDaysDFW/playlists)) if you are interested. \n\n* John mentioned it would be interesting to go to a conference as just an attendee. \n\n## 31:41 John weighs in on a special SRE forum he attended at the conference. \n\n* This was a panel discussion composed of a Google SRE manager, folks who had transitioned to the SRE role, and someone from VMware who had run DevOps workshops. \n\n* Google wrote the [SRE handbook]([https://landing.google.com/sre/books/](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/)). \n\n* John said there was a noticeable difference in the SRE mindset and the mindset of some of his customers, but he's not yet certain how to help bridge the gap. \n\n* Nick referenced a talk from DevOps Days Dallas by Damon Edwards on the transition from SysAdmin to SRE.  Check it out [here]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyjetwgyLv8\u0026list=PLYPbg15kUYAUA0xTGRzDJZhlcqu4l_Ilf\u0026index=4\u0026t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyjetwgyLv8\u0026list=PLYPbg15kUYAUA0xTGRzDJZhlcqu4l_Ilf\u0026index=4\u0026t=0s)). \n\n* John feels the SRE mindset is the future of IT for companies offering services at any kind of scale. \n\n* The definition of an outage may be different than we might think. \n\n* How do error budgets and instability affect change? [Embracing Risk from the Google SRE Handbook](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/embracing-risk/) \n\n* How does the SRE think about maintenance windows? \n\n## 39:32 General conference advice / feedback \n\n* How many people go to a conference that grows their mindset in new ways? \n\n* This happened to John when he attended the SRE forum mentioned previously. \n\n* Is SRE a career path for John? \n\n* Go to a session on a topic that is completely new to you.  Don't fill the schedule with everything in one focus area. \n\n* Nick and John mention [The LevelUp Project]([https://twitter.com/tech_levelup?lang=en](https://twitter.com/tech_levelup?lang=en)) as a fantastic resource for those new to the vCommunity. \n\n* Nick mentions something similar for [Spiceworld Austin](https://www.spiceworks.com/spiceworld/) called the [Spicebuddy Program]([https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2224493-this-has-been-a-long-time-coming](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2224493-this-has-been-a-long-time-coming)). \n\n* Should Nerd Journey do a special meetup at a future conference? \n\n## 47:00  Closing thoughts... \n\n* Attending a conference can accelerate your career.  Plug into communities ahead of time for best results. \n\n* If attending a conference with a co-worker, don't go to the same sessions. \n\n* Get together at meals to debrief one another on what you learned. \n\n* Get some sleep during the conference.  Don't be the person who comes home sick. \n\n* Don't commute to a conference.  That wore John out this year.  Target an AirBnB early for a good price. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Bonus-Episode-7":{"title":"Bonus Episode 7","content":"\n# Bonus Episode 7\n\nWelcome to Bonus episode 07 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss the influence of family on career and the influence of career on family.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 11-13-2019 \n\n* Note that John sneaks in his top 5 delivery pizza places at the beginning (mentioned in [Bonus Episode 2](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-bonus-02-thankful/) from last Thanksgiving). \n\nTopics – Thanksgiving, Family, and Career \n\n## 2:05 – Influence of Family on Career \n\n* Who in your family can be an influence on career? \n\n* These are the people in our lives that model career, how they balance, work, life, and family. \n\n* Sometimes it is chosen family and not birth family. \n\n* The level of influence depends on the amount of time spent with the person.  \n\n* 5:12 - What specific kinds of influence does family have on career? \n\n* Family businesses are often passed down for multiple generations to keep it going.  Nick gives a specific example here. \n\n* Growing up in and around a family business can soak in, making it feel normal.  Some will love this, while some will not. \n\n* Not everyone is qualified to take over a family business, but being exposed to it may influence a person to work in that specific type of industry. \n\n* Sometimes everyone in a family works in the same field (i.e. a family of teachers, a family of doctors, etc.).  John shares an example from his wife's family. \n\n* The career field can become ingrained in children in this type of environment. \n\n* John shares a realization about his current career field. \n\n* Behaviors \n\n* What if family members appear to constantly work or work takes them away from important events and special family time? \n\n* 10:34 – John White School of Mentoring Plug \n\n* Nick shares his daughter's perception of his work. \n\n* Avoidance of work is something that can also be modeled. \n\n* Work / life balance \n\n* If family members have a poor work / life balance, it could cause resentment of a specific job or job field. \n\n* We react to what is modeled around us, regardless of what it is. \n\n* Kids socialize about what their parents do and how present they are. \n\n* Nick got some feedback on time spent working from his brother-in-law.  He did not realize at the time that things were out of balance. \n\n* Being on call is a part of some jobs.  It just is. \n\n* Shift work \n\n* Nick shares a story about his aunt that worked 2nd shift and the effort she made to spend time with family. \n\n* Shift work can lead to the perception of an absentee parent.   \n\n* These types of jobs need to be staffed by someone, and it has an impact on that person's family. \n\n* Pressure to perform \n\n* Do you put pressure on yourself to perform in your career that started with academic pressures when you were younger?  It can happen. \n\n* John shares a story of his parents modeling the importance of education. \n\n* Academic excellence and trying to beat everyone else are two different things. \n\n* Sometimes we don't realize the influence of past experiences on our current attitudes and behaviors until reflecting carefully upon it. \n\n* A high performing sibling can have an impact on other children who are not performing well academically (can be negative or positive). \n\n* Nick shares a story from his time in education. \n\n* Think back to [Episode 19](http://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/) on process over outcomes. \n\n* 21:22 - Why do we think family members are able to influence career? \n\n* Proximity to a specific field or career might make it seem like a safer choice. \n\n* Passion is contagious.  As a result people work hard and get better. \n\n* John has been influenced by a number of extended / chosen family members and is passionate about self-development (perhaps the genesis of The John White School of Mentoring). \n\n* A negative perception of a field or specific job can affect your perception later (i.e. this job took mom / dad away and is not worth me pursuing). \n\n## 24:54 – Career Effect on Family \n\n* Negative effects \n\n* Forced relocation \n\n* John remembers having to relocate many times as a child.  It became something he did not like, but he eventually lost the fear of making new friends, etc. \n\n* Breaking into social circles in a new area can be challenging for adults as well.   \n\n* Consider the challenge of having a parent that was active service military.  It could be a relocation every year or possibly more. \n\n* We would love to hear from listeners who grew up this way (many relocations) and how it affected your level of social interaction with others, perception of career, etc. \n\n* Heavy travel / late hours \n\n* If a job requires heavy travel, you're going to miss time with family.  That has an impact. \n\n* Will childcare be available if one spouse has to travel and the other is working? \n\n* Family members may despise the job because it takes someone away from them too much. \n\n* What about loneliness? John speaks to tremendous workload affecting upkeep of any and all relationships. \n\n* Inflexibility \n\n* What if you can't take time off work to help with a sick family member? \n\n* What if the family only sees you stressed as a result of work and this leads to burn out? \n\n* Go pack and listen to [Episode 58](http://nerd-journey.com/path-to-management-and-hard-resume-lessons-with-kelly-schroeder-pt-1/) and Kelly Schroeder's experience with burn out. \n\n* What if there is no time off for holidays?  Your significant other can become disgruntled as a result. \n\n* Aspirational activities \n\n* Think blogging, attending user groups, and podcasting.  What if these activities take away from family time?  Other family members can see this in a negative light. \n\n* Young children don't understand why you're not available and that investment in career advancement outside of work will help in the long run. \n\n* John mentions the unique approach his family took to these types of activities. \n\n* Sometimes having a discussion can go a long way to mitigate damage. \n\n* Being distracted \n\n* Physical presence and emotional presence are not the same.   \n\n* 38:24 - Positives \n\n* Flexibility \n\n* John's new job changed his level of flexibility. \n\n* Can you go in to the office late, take a long lunch, etc. and make up the time later? \n\n* Working from home occasionally can allow you to be available when needed. \n\n* Modeling good behavior \n\n* You can show your kids what a good employee looks like.  Nick gives an example. \n\n* Modeling boundary setting is important (to keep work in check and to prioritize family time). \n\n* Quality time, even if it is brief, is better than more time with you distracted / working on something else. \n\n* Model your passion / aspirations positively.  \n\n* Money \n\n* We talked about personal finance in [Episode 57](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-5-personal-finance/). \n\n* John's parents modeled use of money and personal finance that he will always remember.  The discussions about this began when he was young. \n\n* Smart money management is necessary in any career.  The answer is not always \"I must make more money.\"  You must get control of your finances. \n\n* John refers to the Open Account podcast episode, [Passing the Torch—And the Wealth: A Conversation with Velma Davis \u0026 Kenya Davis Hayes](https://www.umpquabank.com/blog/open-account-podcast-money-velma-davis-kenya-davis-hayes-passing-down-wealth-real-estate/), where the issue of \"spending fasts\" came up. \n\n* Corporate perks \n\n* Corporate car \n\n* Retain rewards points for corporate travel (the flip side of heavy travel). \n\n* Children don't always understand cause and effect. \n\n* Should we do a career cause and effect podcast? \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Bonus-Episode-8":{"title":"Bonus Episode 8","content":"\n# Bonus Episode 8\n\nWelcome to Bonus Episode 08 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

An unstated reaction against the [Great Man theory of history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory) \n\n* Human progress is incremental \n\n* What seems like giant leaps forward are often the collision and integration of many incremental advances \n\n* YouTube Video: [Faith in Numbers](https://youtu.be/z6yL0_sDnX0?t=2103) - From the cam to the automated loom to the census to the computer \n\n* Nick points out that career progression can look like giant leaps forward which hide small incremental improvements over time \n\n* [Connections on DVD](https://www.amazon.com/Connections-1-5-Disc-Set/dp/B000NJVY3U/) \n\n## 14:11 [Outliers](https://books.google.com/books/?id=3NSImqqnxnkC) - [[Malcom Gladwell]] [[Outliers]]\n\n* The Story of Success \n\n* The Matthew Effect (Matthew 25:29) \n\n* What looks like innate success can often times be attributed to early advantages which are maximized over time \n\n* The [[10,000 Hour Rule]] \n\n* Ultimately, the myths we have about success should be questioned \n\n## 25:19 [The Talent Code](https://books.google.com/books?id=gIHSN-ht0xQC) - [[Daniel Coyle]] - Greatness Isn't Born.

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we have the second of two bonus episodes about the books that shaped our thinking. This week, Nick talks about his book list. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 12-21-2019 \n\n# Topics – Books that shaped our thinking - Nick Korte [[MOC - Book Episode]]\n\n## 1:33 – [Hope and Help for Your Nerves](https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Help-Nerves-Claire-Weekes/dp/0451167228) by Dr. [[Claire Weekes]] [[Hope and Help for Your Nerves]]\n\n* Go back and listen to [Bonus Episode 08](http://nerd-journey.com/most-influential-books-on-my-thinking-john-white/) for the books that shaped John's thinking. [[Bonus Episode 8]] [[John White]]\n\n* Sometimes Nick gets nervous and anxious about things.  Someone he went to church with gave him a copy of this book after recognizing these qualities. \n\n* The book talks about the mind / body connection when it comes to nervous illness. \n\n* One specific idea is the temptation to choose the nearest confidant when you need advice, can't make a decision, or are too overwhelmed. \n\n* Wait, and go to a close friend (someone who knows you need advice) who can listen and talk you through the situation. \n\n* John says this temptation is likely there for anyone who likes to work things out by talking through it. \n\n* This one is a short, easy read.   \n\n## 4:23 - [The Real-Life MBA](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Life-MBA-Winning-Building-Growing/dp/0062362801) by [[Jack Welch]] and [[Suzie Welch]] [[The Real-Life MBA]]\n\n* This book was mentioned in [Episode 20](http://nerd-journey.com/episode-020-reasons-to-quit-area-of-destiny-and-finding-your-area-of-destiny/) to frame the area of destiny concept. [[Episode 20]]\n\n* Nick got this book at a conference, and it has a career section.  In that specific section is where the area of destiny concept was explained and explored.  Here are some nuggets from that section: \n\n* Is it work-life balance or work-life choice?  The distribution of work time vs. personal time is different based on the individual. \n\n* The book cites reasons that careers stall (attitude, nowhere to go within the company, etc.). \n\n* The book emphasizes retention of top talent even through times that require a reduction in force to the point of offering top talent more money. \n\n* Top performers have the ability to leave by way of the fact that they are top performers. \n\n* Loving people on the way out just as you loved them on the way in is important regardless of circumstance. \n\n## 7:34 - [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) by [[David Epstein]] [[Range]]\n\n* The book starts with an interesting comparison between [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Roger Federer]] and how each became a specialist in their respective sports. \n\n* A late blooming generalist can eventually become an excellent specialist despite the lack of a head start. \n\n* Epstein compares kind learning environments vs. wicked learning environments. \n\n* There are multiple examples in the book about expertise from one domain being applied into a different domain. \n\n* This reminds Nick of previous episodes like the one with Jimmy T. ([Episode 35](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-035-jimmy-tassin-minecraft-and-building-community/)) about experience from the Minecraft community. [[Episode 35]] [[Jimmy Tassin]]\n\n* John chimes in and mentions this is cross-disciplinary application is what was stated in something he recommended from [last week's episode](http://nerd-journey.com/most-influential-books-on-my-thinking-john-white/). \n\n* John has read [The Sports Gene](https://www.amazon.com/Sports-Gene-Extraordinary-Athletic-Performance/dp/161723012X) by David Epstein as well. [[The Sports Gene]]\n\n* This book came across as an Audible recommendation. \n\n* Is specializing too early a mistake? \n\n* Nick makes a reference to synthesis from the cognitive domain of [Bloom's Taxonomy][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy). [[Bloom's Taxonomy]]\n\n## 13:03 – [Made to Stick](https://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others/dp/1400064287) by [[Chip and Dan Heath]] [[Made to Stick]]  \n\n* This book defines itself as a compliment to [The Tipping Point](https://www.amazon.com/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference-ebook/dp/B000OT8GD0), which John mentioned [last week]((http://nerd-journey.com/most-influential-books-on-my-thinking-john-white/)). \n\n* The characteristics of sticky ideas are \n\n* Simple \n\n* Take a story from Southwest Airlines as an example of commander's intent. \n\n* Unexpected \n\n* Concrete \n\n* Credible \n\n* Emotional \n\n* Story \n\n* These principles can help others understand why a project needs funding. \n\n## 15:48 – [Switch – How to Change Things When Change Is Hard](https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Change-Things-When-Hard/dp/0385528752) by [[Chip and Dan Heath]] [[Switch]] \n\n* The specific things that are required to encourage and support change are: \n\n* Direct the rider (logical / rational) \n\n* Motivate the elephant (emotional) \n\n* Shape the path (supporting the continued change) \n\n## 17:54 – Nuggets from [Adrian Cockcroft's Reading List](http://a.co/79CGMfB) \n\n* [A Seat at the Table](https://www.amazon.com/Seat-Table-Leadership-Age-Agility/dp/1942788118) by [[Mark Schwartz]] [[A Seat at the Table]] \n\n* This is geared more toward those in IT.  Read this before the next book. \n\n* [War, Peace, and IT](https://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Business-Leadership-Technology/dp/1942788711) by [[Mark Schwartz]] [[War and Peace and IT]] \n\n* This is written more for non-technology business leaders. \n\n* Both books discuss the contractor / control model of IT (projects dictated, budget dictated) and its shortcomings. \n\n* Are requirements actually requirements or just hypotheses? \n\n* Plan for a plan to change.  Use agile methodologies instead of waterfall methodologies. \n\n* Do any of us know what technology will look like in 24 months, for example? \n\n* What if delivery takes so long that no feedback can be given to help keep the work on track to providing a valuable outcome?  Get successes or failures quickly so you can adjust. \n\n* Only successful projects should have funding terminated. \n\n* [[Mark Schwartz]] also wrote [The Art of Business Value](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Business-Value-Mark-Schwartz/dp/1942788045), which Nick has not yet read. [[The Art of Business Value]]\n\n## 25:08 – [The Power of When](https://www.amazon.com/Power-When-Discover-Chronotype-Lunch/dp/0316391263) by [[Michael Breus]] [[The Power of When]]\n\n* The author is a sleep psychologist, and the book helps readers classify their normal sleep patterns and how these can affect many aspects of our lives.  \n\n* Nick started moving his caffeine intake to later in the morning as a result of this book. \n\n## 27:38 - [Enneagram](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/what-is-enneagram) Wisdom \n\n* [The Road Back to You](https://www.amazon.com/Road-Back-You-Enneagram-Self-Discovery/dp/0830846190) by [[Ian Morgan Cron]] and [[Suzanne Stabile]]  [[The Road Back to You]]\n\n* This book gives some questions to ask yourself that can assist you in determining your number on the Enneagram.  It also highlights what each number is like when they are healthy, average, and under stress. \n\n* [The Path Between Us: An Enneagram Journey to Healthy Relationships](https://www.amazon.com/Path-Between-Us-Enneagram-Relationships/dp/0830846425) [[The Path Between Us]]\n\n* There are stories about people who fit into each number category but also tips for interacting with people who fall into each number category. \n\n* [[The map is not the territory]]. \n\n* [[Kelly Schroeder]] mentioned [StrengthsFinder](https://www.gallup.com/press/176429/strengthsfinder.aspx) as an option in [Episode 59](http://nerd-journey.com/management-career-observations-lessons-and-advice-with-kelly-schroeder-pt-2/).  [[Episode 59]]\n\n## 30:41 – [Chasing Excellence](https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Excellence-Building-Fittest-Athletes-ebook/dp/B0743MP21F) by [[Ben Bergeron]] [[Chasing Excellence]]\n\n* This book made Nick want to work out more often but did not make him want to do Crossfit.  It is told through the story of the [Crossfit Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit_Games). \n\n* The separators between world class athletes are those of character, which Ben Bergeron believes can be learned. \n\n* Making goals defined by results lead to disappointment.  Create goals based on effort (i.e. being able to do 100 sit-ups instead of doing them faster than someone else). \n\n* Nick's favorite part is The Process, which is not so different from our episode on [process over outcomes](http://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/).  [[Process over Outcomes]] [[Episode 19]]\n\n* Can you become hyper-focused on the \"right now?\" \n\n* This reminds John of the two modes of thought (experiencial and storytelling). [[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning]]\n\n* The book talks about how many people visualize the ideal version of success.  Visualizing failure helps you prepare for any scenario.  Preparing for ultimate success does not mean you should plan for everything going perfectly. \n\n## 36:02 – [Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805) by [[Chris Voss]] [[Never Split the Difference]]\n\n* The writer was a FBI negotiator who developed an entirely new curriculum for negotiations. \n\n* Labeling situations / emotions forces the other person to evaluate whether something applies to them. \n\n* The tactics described in the book are extremely practical and helpful. \n\n## 38:42 – Books by [[Eliyahu Goldratt]] \n\n* Both books are written as narratives. \n\n* [The Goal](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951) [[The Goal]]\n\n* This is about the theory of constraints and lean manufacturing. Read it before pursuing The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project. \n\n* [Critical Chain](https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Chain-Eliyahu-M-Goldratt/dp/0884271536) [[Critical Chain]]\n\n* This is about the theory of constraints as it relates to project management. \n\n* John is looking to read two books per month in 2020 and wants to add some of these to his list. \n\n## 41:08 Wrap Up \n\n* Nick's favorite book was...Range by David Epstein! \n\n* 42:03 We are working on a Nerd Journey bookshelf with books both we and our guests have recommended (currently under construction). \n\n* We plan to setup an affiliate link for the bookshelf (due to the way Wordpress plugins work).  Money that comes in will likely be for hosting our site and potentially travel to user groups in different areas. \n\n* If you see affiliate links in descriptions on our site, you will know. \n\n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Brad-Christian":{"title":"Brad Christian","content":"\n# Brad Christian\n\n### Title\nProduct Marketing Manager\nFormerly a Solution Engineering Manager in the Networking and Security Business Unit at VMware\n\n### Company\nDataStax\n\n### LinkedIn URL\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/vhipster/\n\n### Twitter\n\n\n### Website\n\n\n### Blurb\nWhen we talked to Brad Christian, he was a Solution Engineering Manager in the Networking and Security Business Unit at VMware.

Most people have a neutral brand; The people in the interviewing and hiring process have no instinctual response to thinking about that person for a role. Building a positive perception shouldn't be too hard. Decide what you want people to think of when they hear your name. Will they know what your skills and strengths are?

Reflecting on The Beginning \n\n* John pitched Nick on the idea to start a podcast right before he began working for VMware (November / December 2017). \n\n* The original thesis was following Nick through the transition from IT Operations to a Technical Pre-Sales role at a vendor. \n\n* Thinking back, this was probably just a couple of podcast topics and not an entire podcast thesis. \n\n* John had been the co-host of the [VMware Communities  Roundtable Podcast](https://www.talkshoe.com/show/vmware-communities-roundtable) for a while and had thought about ways to improve his VMware social footprint.   \n\n* He had maintained [a blog](http://vjourneyman.com/) and frequented the [Spiceworks community](https://community.spiceworks.com/) with some measure of success. #Spiceworks \n\n* Nick's transition to VMware reminded John of his transition from IT Practitioner to Pre-Sales and made him think of those in IT who might need some guidance on where they could take their career. \n\n* In a roundabout way, this eventually helped form our mantra to give people the career advice we wish we had been given earlier in our careers. \n\n* Some of our first topics were going to be \n\n* SE tools \n\n* Tech opinions and news (VMware and other industry news) \n\n* If you're thinking about expanding your sphere of influence, starting a podcast is a great way to do it! \n\n* Being part of this podcast has allowed John and Nick to meet and learn from people they otherwise likely would not have.  Doing this together has also strengthened their friendship. \n\n* John started attending a podcasting meetup and heard about the concept of pod fade. \n\n## 10:50 - Fun with Statistics \n\n* Without knowing the stats before we recorded the show, can John guess the top 10 episodes by download? \n\n* John's Guesses \n\n* Something from the Management Series / Leadership \n\n* Charlie Nichol \n\n* Brad Pinkston \n\n* Brad Tompkins \n\n* Paul Green \n\n* Specific Guests \n\n* Mike Burkhart \n\n* Josh Fidel \n\n* Cody de Arkland \n\n* Yadin Porter de Leon \n\n* Al Rasheed \n\n* Top 10 by the Numbers \n\n* 10 (191 downloads) -

[[Lessons Learned]] from 100 Episodes \n\n* Set a dedicated time each week to do planning and recording. \n\n* We can sometimes put content together independently, but we often need to collaborate and finalize. \n\n* The launch comes back to John's mind. \n\n* It took us a long time to launch…probably much longer than we wanted. \n\n* Many of our practice episodes were WAY too long and had to be chopped up into small pieces. \n\n* Some of our \"segments\" didn't fit the topic we landed on for the podcast. \n\n* We learned that 90 minutes is way too long.  We probably still skew a little on the long side (kissing an hour regularly and should probably be 30-45 minutes). \n\n* The barrier to launch became a mental block for John.  He knew editing wouldn't be too bad, but the technology platform selection turned into a rabbit hole. \n\n* None of that stuff really mattered to the podcast.  We really needed to own the domain and the RSS feed. \n\n* John's podcast meetup group talked through the editing process and different ideas on that.  Some encouraged not editing at all.   \n\n* John didn't want editing to be a 40 hour per week job. \n\n* We still struggle with not using filler / weak words during our dialogues. \n\n* We wanted to sound more energetic and decided on less scripting for the show. \n\n* Most people starting a podcast ask about the technology platforms, microphones, etc.   \n\n* We use some pretty inexpensive #ATR-2100 microphones that are good enough. [[Podcasting Equipment]]\n\n* We use [[Squadcast.fm]] for recording our shows and Audacity for editing after the fact. \n\n* We publish to [[Wordpress]] with the [[Blubrry]] plugin. \n\n* Our issue has been more process than technology. \n\n* Will we ever run out of ideas?  No way! \n\n* Do you have an idea for a guest whose point of view we need on the show?  Please tell us. \n\n## 42:05 - The Next 100 Episodes \n\n* It's all about the stats…not!  Are we being helpful to our listeners?  That is the ultimate measure. \n\n* Nick really likes recruiting people to be on the show and listening to their stories, their perspectives, and their reasons for changes in career. \n\n* We need more diversity on the podcast (need more female guests - only 3 so far but more in the can). \n\n* We want to ensure we have enough quality episodes in the can to hit weekly releases.  If you have an idea for an episode or a guest, please let us know! \n\n* John has noticed there are some podcasts in a similar / related genre that might be nice to revisit. \n\n* [IT Reality Podcast](https://itr-it-reality.zencast.website/) [[IT Reality Podcast]]\n\n* [The Pre-Sales Collective](https://www.presalescollective.com/podcast) [[Pre-Sales Collective]]\n\n* Follow up with [[Ramzi Marjaba]] \n\n* [[IT Career Energizer]] \n\n* There are many people out there who don't know they have a story to tell.  If you've changed jobs a few times, you know something that can help the rest of us.  Don't be shy! \n\n* John's favorite show formats… \n\n* He's always interesting in learning other perspectives (speaking with guests about their journeys). \n\n* Discussing books with Nick and our different perspectives, even discussing articles \n\n* We have not done a career click bait article lately.  Maybe it's time to reboot that! \n\n* Nick's all time favorite episode is [Episode 9](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-009-blowing-an-interview-and-dressing-for-an-interview/) where John goes into a #rant on how to dress for an interview. [[Episode 9]]\n\n* Nick wishes we had tracked episodes with #stingers.  Check out the [stinger tag search](https://nerd-journey.com/tag/stinger) for the full list. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-101":{"title":"Episode 101","content":"\n# Episode 101\n\nWelcome to episode 101 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we discuss making big career changes and reluctant entrepreneurship.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-29-2020 \n\nTopics – The Architect Who Built Something New \n\n=========================== \n\n## 4:22 - Introductions \n\n* Our guest this week is [[Randall Cook]], owner and founder of ShieldWolf Wellness. \n\n* Randall is a recovering Architect who has transitioned to Integrated Wellness Coach. \n\n* Randall worked as an Architect (the building / construction type) mainly focused in the healthcare space (hospitals, emergency rooms, clinics, etc.). \n\n## 6:14 - Some Background \n\n* Randall studied for 7 years in college to be an Architect.  After working the job he landed for 2-3 years, he had some health issues.   \n\n* On top of this, his wife also had some health issues.  \n\n* Despite enjoying the company and the work, it was extremely demanding.  In the first few years, when Randall took vacation, he made it up after the fact in time needed to get caught up on work while away. \n\n* The company was very lean on manpower so they could keep the workforce even in times of a lull in business.  This was a highly stressful situation for Randall. \n\n* Randall noticed if he wanted to progress in his career (which he did), it would take a great deal more time away from his family.  As such, he began looking for something else. \n\n* He initially looked into Security (doing surveys of buildings, etc.).  For 6 months, Randall tried networking to find a way in but had little luck.  After hearing this new line of work could require heavy travel, he realized it was not want he wanted (different field, same problems). \n\n* Once again he began searching for something else. \n\n* Randall calls himself a reluctant #entrepreneur.  Three years ago he never would have expected to be where he is now. \n\n* Randall never really wanted to be his own boss but eventually found the flexibility he desired was only possible via this path. \n\n* Because of the severe health trouble, Randall visited a number of doctors without a real solution / understanding of what was happening.  He did not want a quick fix but was looking for a real fix. \n\n* After devouring as much information as possible through podcasts and other sources, an opportunity with [C.H.E.K. Institute](INSERT LINK) presented itself. \n\n* After prayer and thoughtful consideration, this seemed like a good way to get a foothold into a new industry that fit with Randall's passions. \n\n* CHEK stands for Collective Holistic Exercise Kinesiology, which integrates movement and lifestyle. \n\n* 8:28 - Randall's interest in this did not peak until he got sick.  Though never really considering himself in bad shape before this, he recounts how he kept going until it became a crisis. \n\n## 13:35 - Walking away from Investment in Architecture \n\n* It was a complicated decision.  Architecture was never a passion of Randall's, and he even though about quitting part of the way through due to the intensity of the program. \n\n* To really enjoy it he would have needed to throw himself in at the expense of his family, which was the big decider. \n\n* He spent his entire career (7.5 years) at the same company with much of the same management and co-workers.   \n\n* The company had a reputation of being a great place to learn architecture but a terrible place to be an architect (very high stress environment). \n\n* The company ran lean to ensure people were not laid off.  It seemed like they took on a lot of small projects that were not needed but which cost them the ability to produce some larger projects. \n\n* After spending so much time there, Randall could not see himself moving elsewhere and stepping back in intensity while feeling like he was doing the right job. \n\n* John speaks to staffing levels being an issue in an area outside of technology (something we have not really heard on the show until now). \n\n* Randall said there was a lot of turnover at the company, which is a reflection of company culture. \n\n* At one point the company was acquired.   \n\n## 18:49 - Looking into Other Options \n\n* By the time he had left his job as an Architect, Randall had been doing studies with the CHEK Institute for about 16 months and had two certifications under his belt (holistic lifestyle coach and integrated movement science, each level 1). \n\n* This took a great deal of extra effort on his own time, and it was tough trying to accomplish this without taking away from family time. \n\n* In March / April of 2019, Randall's employer allowed him to work 4 days per week instead of 5 (cut back to 32 hours).  This allowed more time for study and focus on starting his business. \n\n* Randall mentions the [[Ramp Time]] in the Architecture field can really take time when someone new joins the company.  Short projects might take 9 months from start to end of construction (which is an accelerated timeline), and processes may be different at different firms. \n\n* John references his own [[Ramp Time]] as a result of the move to Google Cloud despite having previous industry expertise.  Check out [this episode](https://nerd-journey.com/one-year-as-a-google-cloud-engineer-part-1-with-john-white/) for more details. \n\n## 22:42 - A Reluctant Entrepreneur \n\n* The transition has been a struggle, especially in 2020.  Randall had a number of history blocks which needed to be overcome (ideas about his own abilities and capabilities).  Getting started was a challenge.  \n\n* When you're telling yourself a story you're not even aware of that \"you can't do this,\" then you don't even start. \n\n* Nick referenced a recent [video on mindset](https://www.facebook.com/shieldwolfwellness/videos/263094291408898/) he watched from the [Shieldwolf Wellness page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/shieldwolfwellness/videos). \n\n* Randall said one of the reasons he likes the CHEK school of thought is that it starts with mindset (what you want to do and why). \n\n* Keep in mind how badly you want something, and continue to tell yourself failure is not bad.  This is especially challenging for the self-defeating perfectionist, and Randall shares his struggles here. \n\n* He eventually had to adopt a [MacGyver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver) mindset.  \"What do I have and what can I do with it?\" \n\n* Randall's biggest enemy as an architect was his perception of his own competence in the field (despite others saying he was very good). \n\n* Things didn't seem to turn out the way he had pictured they would in his mind.  He felt he was often only a step away from disaster. \n\n* It took some expensive mistakes to break this cycle.  After the mistakes were made, he was still looked at as a competent architect by his employer. \n\n* John shares his theory about employers who budget for employee mistakes (i.e. error budgets). \n\n* Randall mentioned even the owners at the architecture firm provided encouragement after some costly mistakes. \n\n## 34:20 - Telling the Family \n\n* Randall said he got a good job right out of school (at the architecture firm) and was given a raise every year without needing to ask for it.  It was high stress and long hours. \n\n* Some nights it might only be a few hours of sleep near the end of a project to ensure it was completed on time. \n\n* With his wife's poor health, the two wanted something more for their family. \n\n* Randall mentioned his kids crying every day when he would go to work and thinking \"this can't be right.  This can't be the way life is supposed to be.\" \n\n* Randall's wife was 100% supportive of his desire to make a change.  In many ways being at that job (with the architecture firm) was slowly killing him (emotionally and physically). \n\n* Something in the office where Randall worked seemed to aggravate his allergies. \n\n* For a period of about a year, he had to fly to Colorado every other week.  It was challenging to stay hydrated, and the schedule was very tight. \n\n* Feel free to contact Randall via his [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/shieldwolfwellness/), on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shieldwolfwellness/), or on his [website](https://shieldwolfwellness.com/). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. \n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-102":{"title":"Episode 102","content":"\n# Episode 102\n\nWelcome to episode 102 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss our relationships with food, life, and work in the second half of our conversation with Randall Cook.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-29-2020 \n\nTopics – Food, Life, and Work [[Randall Cook]]\n\n============================= \n\n## 04:07 - It's All Part of the Practice \n\n* Randall is a coach.  He does not treat people but rather coaches them (and helps people help themselves). \n\n* It starts with gaining clarity on what people want out of engaging with Randall. \n\n* Many want to lose 10 pounds, for example.  While this is a goal, it is not the destination. There is usually something behind that people want. \n\n* Goals should align with your vision for the life you want.  Staying focused on a goal can make you obsessed with reaching it to the point where you forget why you are chasing it. \n\n* John shares a good illustration of the difference between a goal and a metric used to represent a goal.  Is your goal just a metric? \n\n* Randall has some detailed questionnaires which allow for objective assessment of where a person is. \n\n* As an example, one of the questions is \"how often do you buy your food?\"  Buying less often while good for budgets may not be so good for nutrients.  \n\n* After going through the assessment together with a client, Randall works with the person to determine 1-3 things to change (no more than 3).  When trying to make changes to your life and your habits, it can get overwhelming very quickly. \n\n* Changing too many things at once may cause you to hit a trigger you did not realize existed. \n\n* 46:20 - Food is a big trigger for people.  Also, food can be very emotional. \n\n* Randall gives the example of a professor who wakes up thinking about making coffee. \n\n* John shares a story about a specific kind of tea reminding him of his mother. \n\n* For some people turkey could remind them of fights around the Thanksgiving table, while it may remind others of being at home. \n\n* Without an acknowledgement of food associations, people cannot successfully change their eating habits. \n\n* Randall mentions his struggles with soda. \n\n## 16:46 - Food Choices Aren't Right or Wrong \n\n* One of the biggest things for Randall was realizing his food choices are not right or wrong.  But, think about whether that choice will help achieve the goal you want. \n\n* You can get trapped in a cycle of feeling remorse after eating something you feel you shouldn't and unconsciously seek out ways to make yourself feel bad. \n\n* Get clear on what you want out of your life, and then understand what the food you eat will do to you. \n\n* When Randall got sick, there were days where he would sit at work and accomplish nothing because his brain just was not working / he could not think straight. \n\n* The afternoon slump is real, but with the wrong choice you can push it to all day. \n\n* Think about what you want from your food.  Randall does not believe there are wrong choices.   \n\n* He shares the example of using donuts and coffee to cope with high stress near the end of his time at the architecture firm and paying the price as a result. \n\n* John mentions using conscious choice rather than operating on autopilot. \n\n* If you want your food to provide energy or help you perform optimally, you must become aware of what it does to you. \n\n* Millions of chemical reactions happen inside our bodies at any given second, and the way they affect us is different for everyone. \n\n* One way to gain insight here is to keep a food journal - what you eat and when you eat it, what you drink and when you drink it, how you feel during the day (i.e. document energy slumps with specific time of day, other side effects like a cough or an itch). \n\n* When someone starts working with Randall, he asks them to fill out a 10 day diet log, the kind of exercise they did, how they slept, how bowel movements have been, etc.  \n\n* Part of what Randall looks at is the variety of foods.  The average person may only eat about 10 different foods on a regular basis. \n\n* Looking at this data should present a pattern that can be manipulated carefully. \n\n* 58:53 - Randall had to go to a holistic doctor at one point.  This person identified 5 foods causing him problems - egg yolks, beans, casein, gluten, and solanine (compound found in [nightshades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae)). \n\n* It's really hard to find food without one of these in it.  For example, at Chipotle Randall could have lettuce, rice, and the pork. \n\n* Limiting foods like this is mentally taxing, and Randall needed support from his wife to stay vigilant. \n\n* To a large degree, Randall still avoids those foods.  He shares different ways he has been able to adapt food choices to eat as cleanly as possible. \n\n## 29:09 - Foods to Avoid, Tactics to Embrace? \n\n* Milk in the US is pasteurized (all enzymes killed that would help with digestion) and homogenized (put through tiny filter that slices up all fat cells). \n\n* Organic food is better for many reasons.  You are only as healthy as the food you eat, which is only as healthy as the food it eats. \n\n* Cattle in the US are typically fed very poor diets to fatten. \n\n* The amount of fat you need in a diet depends on you (genetic heritage, health, digestion). \n\n* Fat has two purposes - storing energy and isolating toxins the body cannot dispose of \n\n* Our choices of what to buy at the supermarket can create a gap in dietary needs. \n\n* 1:07:49 - Things We Can Do and Eat to Sharpen Mental Acuity \n\n* There is how much food you eat and what you eat.  Too much food means the body has to devote more resources toward digestion. \n\n* You are trying to manage blood sugar level (insulin).  When under a lot of stress, the body converts protein into sugars and spikes insulin. \n\n* Healthy fats are helpful if you are not under stress. \n\n* Randall shares a hack with coffee and MCT oil which allows the body to help digest the coffee and boost brain function at the same time. \n\n* John and Randall talk about the idea of [Bulletproof Coffee](https://www.bulletproof.com/recipes/bulletproof-diet-recipes/bulletproof-coffee-recipe/). [[Bulletproof Coffee]]\n\n## 36:59 - Taking Control \n\n* Getting control of your health starts with awareness…awareness of the choices you're making and the effect they have on your life.  Until you have this, you are basically throwing darts at the wall. \n\n* John mentioned that this reminds him of the [Quantified Self](https://quantifiedself.com/) methodology. [[Quantified Self]]\n\n* As you change your diet, eating habits, and sleeping patterns the body will change.  And its needs will change. \n\n* If you're eating the same way in a few years as you are tomorrow, you probably aren’t helping yourself as much as you might think. \n\n* Randall mentioned when he saw the holistic doctor he relied on that doctor to \"fix it.\"  He was not given the tools to fix it on his own. \n\n* Randall's goal as a coach is to give people the tools they need to take control of their lives so they don't need him any longer. \n\n* You can do this on your own, but it's challenging to do without the power of outside eyes. \n\n* This reminds Nick of the episode on [Inner Game of Stress](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-the-inner-game-of-stress-by-gallwey-hanzelik-and-horton/) from several weeks ago. [[The Inner Game of Stress]]\n\n## 40:51 - Easing Decisions about Food and Closing Thoughts \n\n* Do your research on restaurants.  You cannot wait until you pull up to a drive through to start the research. \n\n* Most companies have ingredients listed to avoid food allergies which can be found online. \n\n* Panda Express, for example, has gluten in just about every dish.  The teriyaki chicken sauce is made with flour, but you can order it without the sauce.  Many people do not want to modify their order. \n\n* Randall was a picky eater as a kid and did not like to modify his order even then, which still affects him when placing an order today. \n\n* Put in the work to research restaurants in the area you are likely to visit and what you can eat from them so you don't have to decide when you drive up / walk in. \n\n* Optimal grocery shopping would be twice per week for produce.  Randall says it's important to keep grocery shopping a low stress endeavor.  If needing to make a second trip in a week would add stress, the return likely is not worth it. \n\n* When you start getting stressed, you stop digesting food. \n\n* Don't watch something stressful before you eat. \n\n* Don't watch something too exciting before eating (i.e. something that spikes adrenaline). \n\n* Digestion starts in the brain with the mental acknowledgement that you are about to take in food. \n\n* If you are busy watching something, reading something, etc. you may not even taste your food.  You may not as a result be producing all the enzymes needed for digestion.  The more focused you can be with eating the better. \n\n* It all starts with becoming aware that there is a problem and then wanting to change it - whether it is career or health. \n\n* This cannot be forced. \n\n* Feel free to contact Randall via his [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/shieldwolfwellness/), on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shieldwolfwellness/), or on his [website](https://shieldwolfwellness.com/). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-103":{"title":"Episode 103","content":"\n# Episode 103\n\nWelcome to episode 103 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we discuss Nick's 3-Year Check-in at VMware, part 1.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 12-18-2020 \n\nTopics – Nick's 3-Year Check-in at VMware, Part 1 [[Nick Korte]] #VMware [[Year Check In|X Year Check-In]] [[Sales Engineering]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 1:05 - Revisiting Nick's Journey at VMware \n\n* We're picking up a topic we started back in [Episode 1](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-001-career-advancement-and-nicks-first-week-at-vmware/).  That episode covered Nick's first week at VMware.  This episode marks 3 years for him at VMware. [[Episode 1]]\n\n* Nick wrote [this blog post](http://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2017/12/04/a-letter-to-the-dreamer-be-brave-enough/) describing how his career at VMware started in late 2017. \n\n## 2:32 - Still Living the Dream \n\n* Nick started in December 2017 in the commercial segment at VMware as a Systems Engineer (or Solution Engineer as it later became), supporting 3 salespeople as their pre-Sales technical counterpart. \n\n* Each of the salespeople had territories containing hundreds of customers across North Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. \n\n* Nick would travel to Oklahoma probably once per month.  The frequent trips out of town were relatively new. \n\n* Even when in meetings all day while on the road, e-mails continued to come in that needed to be addressed.  Separating urgent from important was a requirement for keeping up and getting enough rest. \n\n* When not visiting customers, Nick would work from home. \n\n* The team of SE peers Nick joined was made of people scattered across the south central United States. \n\n* The team was extremely welcoming.  Nick felt comfortable calling other team members when he needed help navigating the VMware organization. \n\n* Much like teaching math and working the help desk, Nick loved the dynamic aspect of SE life in this segment. \n\n* We might not talk to the same customer very many times (maybe only the very top tier). \n\n* There may not be a lot of time to do research on the customers before meetings. \n\n* Many times Nick would meet with people who had a similar background to his as a customer (not always but much of the time).  This made it easy to relate to what these customers did every day. \n\n* Work-life balance was off for a little while.  This took some figuring out with travel, the need to be responsive to customers, and the need to support other teammates. \n\n* Nick also had to learn when to utilize internal specialists in customer conversations. \n\n## 9:44 - A Change in Segment \n\n* In February 2019, Nick transitioned into the Enterprise segment.  He moved from supporting 3 salespeople to 1 and from supporting almost 1000 customers to supporting 3.   \n\n* These customers were different.  We're talking global companies with technology teams in different locations and business units who might not talk to one another. It's almost like many customers in one. \n\n* This involved a number of transitions.  Nick supported a (new to him) salesperson, team of SE peers, set of customers, a new manager.   \n\n* If you follow the podcast you probably got a clue as to when this happened (since we have done shows on some of these topics). \n\n* Nick didn't understand how he could possibly stay busy with just 3 customers but found out quickly they were plenty to keep him very busy!  \n\n* In this segment, Nick did not have to travel as much out of state.  Most customer visits were within driving distance. \n\n* One customer would require out of state travel every now and then. \n\n* There were still days when Nick would be gone all day (out visiting customers).  He had to plan gaps in the day and stops for meals and was very intentional about it.  See [EP 102](https://nerd-journey.com/food-life-and-work-with-randall-cook/) for some tips on how to make better decisions at restaurants. [[Episode 102]]\n\n* Nick's new team of SE peers were all local to Dallas / Fort Worth except one who lived in Austin and visited Dallas pretty often. \n\n* Nick's manager was in Dallas rather than completely remote (the case during the Commercial days) and liked to come in to the VMware office a few days per week. \n\n* Nick began coming into the office as well to get face time with the boss and teammates.  The extended team of specialists would come to the office as well. \n\n* On occasion, there were customer meetings at the VMware office. \n\n* In Enterprise, the number of resources (i.e. specialists) at Nick's disposal went up exponentially.  He had to learn how to use these resources wisely. \n\n* This segment seemed to bring with it increased pressure. \n\n* There were meetings with high ranking technical officials who shape the overall strategy. \n\n* If you're not used to communicating with these types of people, it can be a challenge.   \n\n* Check out the episodes with [[Brad Tompkins]] for more on this challenge: \n\n* [Journey to Executive Leadership with Brad Tompkins of VMUG](https://nerd-journey.com/journey-to-executive-leadership-with-brad-tompkins-of-vmug/) [[Episode 71]]\n\n* [Board and Executive Relationships with Brad Tompkins of VMUG](https://nerd-journey.com/board-and-executive-relationships-with-brad-tompkins-of-vmug/) [[Episode 72]]\n\n* Larger organizations had Enterprise Architecture teams, Technology Review Boards, VPs of SaaS and other red tape that was not present in the commercial segment. \n\n* The challenges and mindsets of these teams was pretty new and not as relatable. \n\n## 19:37 - Reflecting on Other Changes \n\n* VMware continues to grow as does its portfolio, whether via organic growth or acquisition.  That means more to learn as a generalist! \n\n* As for extracurricular activities, Nick has continued as co-leader of the [Dallas / Fort Worth SpiceCorps](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps/dallas-fort-worth) but ended up missing squeezing in a meeting for Q4.  #Spiceworks \n\n* Nick has been more involved in #VMUG this year.  In fact, he and John did a career session for the VMUG December Virtual Event. \n\n* This year Nick co-presented with [[Mark Foley]] at #VMworld.  You can watch the recording of that session [here](https://www.vmworld.com/en/video-library/video-landing.html?sessionid=1589574792283001qUJ4). \n\n* Nick has been trying to write one blog per month but doesn't always hit that mark.  He did start up a [blog series](http://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2020/02/28/a-first-voyage-into-azure-functions-and-function-apps/) on Azure Functions and Tanzu Observability to learn something new and its ties into a VMware product. \n\n* This involved writing code, learning Azure DevOps, and CI / CD. \n\n* It is important to get outside the vendor bubble.  Nick continues to remind himself of this. \n\n* Nick also joined the DFW Azure Meetup group. \n\n* He was recently accepted into the [CTO Ambassador program at VMware](https://octo.vmware.com/).   \n\n* This opens a number of new doors within the company.  Nick will have to report back on the types of projects in which he is involved. \n\n* This will require better time management. \n\n* The changes in segment and change in customer base has helped Nick develop a very wide network both inside VMware and beyond. \n\n* When Nick talks to customers, he tries to encourage them to be a part of online communities and do presentations. \n\n* Nick has been thinking a lot about mentoring. \n\n* When he started at VMware, he was given a dedicated mentor (a peer you can ask questions you might not feel comfortable asking your boss). \n\n* In wanting to provide this help to others, Nick has worked with the Academy SE program to provide mentorship to folks learning how to become Solution Engineers.  It's extremely rewarding. \n\n* John has some questions for Nick, but you'll have to wait until next time to hear the answers! \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-104":{"title":"Episode 104","content":"\n# Episode 104\n\nWelcome to episode 104 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we have the second half of our discussion with Nick on his 3 years at VMware.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 12-18-2020 \n\nTopics – Nick's 3-Year Check-in at VMware, Part 2 [[Nick Korte]] #VMware [[Year Check In|X Year Check-In]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 1:10 - Let the Grilling Begin \n\n* Last week we heard Nick's reflection on 3 years at VMware.  This week is John's chance to grill him! \n\n* What has made Nick stay for 3 years? \n\n* He still loves the company, what it does, and the technology it makes.  He still appreciates the time using VMware technologies as a customer and has enjoyed seeing the growth of the company since that time and since he joined. \n\n* There are many career opportunities inside the company not available to Nick when he worked as a customer. \n\n* The work is dynamic, which Nick loves.  The people he works with appreciate what he does, are helpful, and the managers have been very encouraging and supportive. \n\n## 3:19 - A Follow up on Feedback from the One-Year Check-In \n\n* See [Episode 21](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-021-nicks-first-year-at-vmware-part-1/) and [Episode 22](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-022-nicks-first-year-at-vmware-part-2/) for Nick's first year reflection. [[Episode 21]] [[Episode 22]]\n\n* What about the adjustment from going to an office and working from home?  What has this adjustment been like for Nick and his family? \n\n* Nick's daughter did not like when he had to travel for several days.  She now appreciates that he does not have to leave town very much. \n\n* Nick tries to communicate his schedule in advance (even during the times he only traveled locally to visit customers / go into the office) to ensure there's no conflict with family schedules or that things can be adjusted accordingly. \n\n* What about the daily routine? \n\n* Now it is all work from home.   \n\n* In the early days there were full days at home, partial days at home, entire days traveling (locally or in another state). \n\n* Just before the pandemic there was less travel out of state and more within driving distance. \n\n* There is still an element of catch up when you're out visiting customers and traveling. \n\n* Now that he is 100% work from home, we plan accordingly to engage customers as needed. \n\n* How has Nick adjusted to the career strategy?  He was so focused at getting into VMware in the beginning that he lost sight of what was next. [[After You Get In]]\n\n* Nick has had conversations with each of his managers to get feedback on his strengths / where they think he should go. \n\n* Some of the advice was don't specialize too early.  Become very good at what you do not, and take that specialty into something more technical.  See also [Episode 26](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-026-generalist-specialist-divide/) on the differences between being a generalist and a specialist. [[Episode 26]] #Generalist \n\n* Nick has also thought about [[Technical Marketing]] since he enjoys blogging and presenting.  But he also likes meeting with customers. \n\n* He likes mentoring others.  Nick says his wife thinks he would be a great manager, but he is not sure that is what he wants (not sure if it is his [Area of Destiny](https://nerd-journey.com/episode-020-reasons-to-quit-area-of-destiny-and-finding-your-area-of-destiny)).  Each manager has told Nick he could certainly do management if he desired with the proper training.   [[Area of Destiny]]\n\n* Right now, he is riding the track of staying on the generalist SE (Solution Engineer) path. \n\n* Nick is focused on [[Deliberate Practice]] in this SE role but also taking a step back to figure out how he can broaden knowledge about tech in general but also get deeper in certain areas of the portfolio.  Perhaps certifications would be a good help here. \n\n* John says it sounds like Nick has a good philosophical basis for his career.  The tactical next things to shoot for maybe are not as important.  The concrete next step / short term goal of progressing up the SE ladder sounds like the way to go. \n\n* Nick likes the idea of staying fluid in future plans (allowing himself to fall into something new if it is the right way to go) but focus on getting better every day. \n\n* What did Nick have to learn about the hard way? \n\n* Some technical and business leader personas were very new to Nick.  There were times when he got very nervous (and felt a lot of pressure) about having conversations with these folks. He eventually decided not to be afraid to mess up and make mistakes because he knows it will happen.  Too much pressure before one of these conversations doesn't help.  Nick wants to define success in terms of something he can control rather than the outcomes.  \n\n* John mentioned having to do research on what C-level folks care about and how important it was to know this going into the conversation.  It's not really products. \n\n* Seeking to understand is a great approach. \n\n* What has it been like to experience the growth and change at VMware over these years? \n\n* Some products are now SaaS and on-premises.  Despite the same features, they have different license models.  You have to know which one will be better for the customer.  Each product is a wealth of information. \n\n* The experience of getting educated in each area is like spinning plates.  It can be challenging to stay up to date in all areas. \n\n* Nick has probably studied up more than needed in certain cases.   \n\n* John mentioned finding the right level of depth is difficult. \n\n* Some of the learning came from finding the answers to questions from customers (out of necessity).  These can also be good opportunities to learn a customer's business better. \n\n* What about the philosophy of training and balancing the internal skills training with external interests? \n\n* Nick points this out as an opportunity for improvement.  There is still a quarterly week of enablement. \n\n* There are live trainings and recorded trainings, some optional and some required.  Customer facing activities are the priority. \n\n* The balance is hard to keep. \n\n* What about interaction with the larger account team? \n\n* Think of Nick as the technical quarterback of the account.  He works with other internal groups and pulls them in at the right time and for the right purpose. \n\n* This requires some kind of synchronization meeting with the specialist teams. \n\n* You try to make the right call for engaging these specialists. \n\n* Nick thinks of it like this… \n\n* Do the right thing for the customer. \n\n* Be helpful to internal teammates.  One way to do that is getting them involved to help when valuable to the customer, the account team, and the specialists themselves. \n\n* Many customers don't often realize how big their account team is. \n\n* How has the business of technology influence been for Nick? \n\n* Some of it comes from exploring the VMware tech and using it himself.  Nick has, for example, shared his explorations with Azure Functions and Tanzu Observability with customers. \n\n* Having a body of work to support what you're talking about helps provide credibility. \n\n* Influence can also come from pushing people forward in their career.  This can come from helping others build skills and encouraging them to share with the greater community. \n\n* Nick initially had some discomfort in being perceived as being in a Sales role as opposed to being looked at as a technologist.  How has that gone? \n\n* Nick tries to operate with integrity in all circumstances. \n\n* As John has stated previously, the Solution Engineering organization does sit within a greater Sales organization but is separate. \n\n* Nick has to be concerned about whether the technology will solve the problem the customer has, if it will work, if the right version and licenses were selected, etc. \n\n* Part of this is a due diligence to the company and the customer.   \n\n* Being a truth teller is important. \n\n## 28:50 - Culture Check-In \n\n* How has the change in teams, managers, and segments helped Nick's career? \n\n* He likes to learn how others do the job, how they interact with their customers, how they interact with others internally, etc. \n\n* Aggregating the bright spots / what is working for others can be adapted to your own style so you're still you. \n\n* These changes have helped build a support network of peers who are willing to help. \n\n* Big time collaborations have often get kicked off by sharing with teammates and getting to know one another on a personal level. \n\n* Nick shares the story of a teammate who vetted an idea he had for VMworld that was eventually accepted. \n\n* What about manager changes specifically? \n\n* It's good to get those different perspective from leaders and hear what they believe is important.   \n\n* The coaching methodology has remained the same from management.  You just have to get used to the manager's style, the metrics they want to collect, how involved they want to be, etc.  Adapting to someone else helps you grow. \n\n## 32:51 - Reflections from before VMware \n\n* Nick wishes he would have been able to describe the benefits of his projects to the company.  He's not sure he was as attentive to what leadership cared about as he should have been. \n\n* Nick was not reading a lot of books outside of work at that time.  He wishes he had done more reading and been less consumed by tactical things. \n\n* He participated in the Spiceworks community, but he's become better after job changes at connecting in the vExpert community, on Twitter, and in other communities. \n\n* Nick wishes he would have spun up a home lab back then, but he never seemed to have the time (or the resources for that matter).  \n\n* How could Nick have made it to VMware faster? \n\n* Nick was not sure how much he was going to like IT when he first fell into it and definitely was not mindful of all the options available in the field. \n\n* The folks that Nick started connecting with outside of work most of the time did the same job as him.  He didn't have the kind of exposure to the types of roles that existed and should have spent time asking people about the career opportunities available. \n\n* He got so busy that he never really wondered if he was on the right path / if the job at the time was what he wanted to be doing. \n\n* Advice for the would be SE? \n\n* Talk to people who do the job at different companies because it does not mean the same thing everywhere.  Know the full scope of what it is. \n\n* Make sure you are comfortable with the technical depth. \n\n* You need to believe in the products / services your employer provides. \n\n* You should like working with people.  The SE job isn't for you if you don't like interacting with people. \n\n* Reach out to Nick or John if you need help / advice! \n\n* The life of a SE is hard to describe.  No one can be told what the matrix is.  \n\n* For anyone out there, take some time to step out of the day-to-day and spend time in reflection about what you do, what you like about it, where you work, etc. \n\n* John cites how important it is to have a written job description for the role you have. \n\n* These are all things we probably just didn't take time to think about.   \n\n* The best time to plant a tree is 15 years ago, and the next best time is today.  It's never too late to start. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-105":{"title":"Episode 105","content":"\n# Episode 105\n\nWelcome to episode 105 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we talk to Steven Murawski's career journey through the Microsoft ecosystem.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 11-17-2020 \n\nTopics – [Steven Murawski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/usepowershell/) of Microsoft [[Steven Murawski]] #Microsoft \n\n=========================== \n\n## 02:32 - Meet Steven Murawski \n\n* Steven is a #Principal Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.  The Cloud Advocate team's mission is to help people out in the community be successful with Azure - regardless of tooling, company size, or person's role. \n\n* Steven focuses more on #DevOps type tasks with Microsoft. \n\n* His background is split between development and operations and tries to bridge between the product teams at Microsoft and the greater community.  This enables him to give feedback and be a voice of community members to influence products. \n\n* This is not confined to [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops) specifically.  It's anything Azure and anything in the DevOps space related to it. \n\n* We're talking about anything involved in going from business idea to business value from initial story and product ideas throughout the process. \n\n* Steven's journey into IT set him up well to journey into DevOps.  This (IT) is his 3rd career.  That previous experience set him up well to do what he does today. \n\n* This involves working with folks in Marketing, Product Management, and other areas. \n\n* If we don't all work together, our organization will not be as successful and functional as it could be. \n\n## 08:01 - Steven's Journey \n\n* He owned a garden center / flower shop for 8 years and then went back to school to become a police officer. \n\n* At the police department Steven worked as a clerk, a dispatcher, an auxiliary officer, and his boss eventually found out he knew something about computers. \n\n* When he was a business owner, it was mainly Quickbooks and Excel.  At the police department he was able to dip his toe into a number of different areas. \n\n* DevOps wasn't something super popular in the 2005 - 2006 time frame. \n\n* Ultimately Steven's goal was to become a police officer.  He worked as a clerk at the police department and other jobs while going to school. \n\n* Steven talked about seeing the flow of paperwork through courts, observing prisoner transports and exchanges with other police departments, and he was able to see the flow of work through the entire organization. \n\n* All of this business process flow observation and knowledge made him so much more effective when transitioning to work as an IT person for the police department. \n\n* Some of the knowledge and the idea of learning how technology enables the business transferred easily to other roles. \n\n* Steven mentions reading [The Goal](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951) by [[Eliyahu Goldratt]], which made all of this \"click.\"   [[The Goal]] \n\n* There's another audiobook called [Beyond The Goal](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Goal-Eliyahu-M-Goldratt-audiobook/dp/B000ELJ9NO) in which Goldratt talks about organizations adopting technology to diminish some limitation, but they rarely go back to evaluate the business process that exists to deal with that limitation.   [[Beyond The Goal]]\n\n* Steven mentions the police department adopting a computer aided dispatch and record management and having to analyze every single process (why they were doing it, whether the software allowed them to change it, if they needed new software capabilities, etc.). \n\n* This is the missing key we get in DevOps.  If we don't change processes adopted to deal with the fact that the technology did not exist previously, we cannot realize the true benefits that DevOps / scripting / whatever capability we're trying to adopt. \n\n* At the public safety software company where Steven later worked, his title (Director of Research and Development)  did not indicate all of his responsibilities.   \n\n* Steven did Pre-Sales, Post-Sales, training, etc.  He spoke both geek and cop and was able to do translating. \n\n* He helped customers analyze processes to see what could be improved. \n\n* As he would do this, he got a real appreciation of the role of a Pre-Sales Engineer. \n\n* Even as he went on into other roles at Chef and Microsoft, he really enjoyed being a part of these conversations to see how the end state changed.  Many times companies were not realizing the value / outcomes that other organizations were talking about. \n\n* This gave him a very good appreciation of what customers were going through and ways to provide better direction. \n\n* Listen to Steven's story about when he was at Chef but had someone call him regarding [PowerShell Desired State Configuration](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sysadmin/powershell/powershell-desired-state-configuration-the-basics/) for advice. #Chef\n\n* He was able to speak frankly about what someone would learn from going down the PowerShell route, when they would run into challenges, and how it would set them up to adopt other tools. \n\n* If Steven had not been through analyzing changes in organizations with technology adoption, he would not have earned as much credibility in the next discussions. \n\n* Steven worked for a data services company (Edgenet) because they had the ability to implement and work with cool stuff because it was cool. \n\n* If there was a pre-production build from Microsoft, they were running it in production well before the release dates and working with Microsoft to test and give feedback on it. \n\n* In this case, there was not an immediate tie back to business capabilities.  He was, however, able to work with people in a number of different departments.  This allowed him to build strong relationships and get IT Operations into the conversation much sooner. \n\n* He started by attending developer meetings (in listen only mode first) and eventually began talking to the developers about some of the platforms and capabilities they (IT) had. \n\n* Opening the dialogue enabled developers to be more collaborative.  They pointed fingers less after this experience. \n\n* Steven's desire to be in the developer meetings were fairly well received.  He knew a number of them from the .NET user community. \n\n## 26:06 - A Late Start and The Need to Catch Up \n\n* Steven realized he had many years to catch up on when he got into IT (starting around the age of 30). \n\n* He read everything he could.  For example, one of his favorite books was [The Practice of Systems and Network Administration](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-System-Network-Administration-Second/dp/0321492668) by [[Tom Limoncelli]]. [[The Practice of System and Network Administration]]\n\n* Interestingly enough, Steven got to work with Tom and recruited him to [[Stack Overflow]]. \n\n* Steven was also listening to a number of podcasts.  He pointed out one of the first podcasts he came across on Systems Administration. \n\n* He also looked for local [[user groups]] to join.  There happened to be .NET User Group, a LOPSA (League of Professional Systems Administrators) Chapter, and not much else. \n\n* Being into PowerShell, Steven enjoyed the .NET User Group.  He would often learn new things and eventually started doing talks at these groups. \n\n* In entering the IT field late, Steven wanted to do something to distinguish himself from others in the field.  Giving presentations seems to be a willingness many people do not have. \n\n* Steven leaned on previous experience in drama to help him get over the fear of public speaking. \n\n* Steven observed that many people believe they do not know enough about a topic to give a presentation to peers.  This leads to impostor syndrome. \n\n* Steven references a book by [[Scott Adams]] - [How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1591847745).  In the book there is the idea of talent stacks. [[How to Fail at Almost Everything ans Still Win Big]]\n\n* Steven was technically competent, relatively well-known in communities, and a willingness to try new things.  He never really had a fear of change.  It was always \"go learn this or that\" because he felt he was behind.  No knowledge was off the table with so many things to learn out there. \n\n* Steven built a base that allowed distinguishing him from others.  He was able to transition from the role at the public safety software company to his Systems Administration role at Edgenet (a senior role that allowed him to work on a series of different projects). \n\n* He wasn't afraid to just jump in and learn new things because he felt had to in order to catch up. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-106":{"title":"Episode 106","content":"\n# Episode 106\n\nWelcome to episode 106 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. Today's episode is the second in our three-episode discussion with [Steven Murawski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/usepowershell/), Principal Cloud Advocate at Microsoft. We dive deep into a discussion of Steven's philosophy and experience with learning new things by embracing being a beginner. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 11-17-2020 \n\nTopics – The Beginner Mindset, Theory and Applied [[Steven Murawski]]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:46 - The Birth of the [[Beginner's Mindset]] and Its Effects \n\n* Despite Steven's role today, he continues to embrace this beginner mindset. \n\n* One of his current projects at Microsoft is to build up a DevSecOps open hack. \n\n* #DevSecOps is an area where he is very much a beginner.  Code scanning and penetration testing are new experiences, but this is opportunity for him to learn which is adjacent to other skills and experiences he has already built. \n\n* A willingness to be a beginner and ask the dumb questions has been an enabler for finding and moving forward in his career. \n\n* Being a beginner does not necessarily force someone into an entry level role.  You're bringing experience with you.  The totality of the experience and knowledge brought in by the individual can enable quick learning and the ability to integrate into a broader set of scenarios than if someone had started learning only one specific field with no additional experiences / skills. \n\n* There's a fear of being a beginner.  Hopefully a future employer and manager can see the total package brought to a new role that is the summation of past skills and experience. \n\n* Over time and looking over a broader scope, it could be changing companies, working from a different place, etc.  Look at and be willing to explore other options. \n\n* Steven has been fortunate that his wife has been extremely supportive of his extracurricular activities. \n\n* For example, he self-funded conference passes and travel to teach a class / give a talk.  He knew it was working toward something. \n\n* It's easy to have an honest conversation about risk vs. reward and whether he should pursue it with his wife. \n\n* There is a difference between spending 30 years on 1 thing and spending 30 years doing 1 year worth of work on something. \n\n* Diving in deep in an area enables exposure to adjacencies and pick places to spread out.  If you haven't spent time branching out, you will have more difficulty. \n\n* Listen to Steven's examples. \n\n* There are very few things that have in return in terms of looking at that next thing / next skillset. \n\n* At the end of the day, there is not a lot of difference in the types of jobs Steven has had.  There are levels of things, but he still leverages things he learned back at the police department. \n\n* Nick makes the connection between this conversation and the premise of [Range](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World-ebook/dp/B07H1ZYWTM) by [[David Epstein]]. [[Range]] \n\n* Be careful ascribing motive to situations where we can only see behaviors (i.e. someone in the same field for many years). \n\n* 10:45 It's harder to make a change after doing something for 31 years than if you did it for 30 years.  It's never too late to start! \n\n* It is tough to argue against the current state.  We do not often evaluate the risk of staying where we are.  This is a challenge in having a DevOps conversation as well.  When exactly will the tipping point be for an organization? \n\n* John has heard the phrase that we underestimate our ability to see 6 months in the future and overestimate our ability to see 5 years into the future. \n\n* There will always be factors external to our organization's control.  Ask yourself what you are doing to put yourself in the best place for tomorrow. \n\n* A thought from [Pat McNamara](https://www.tmacsinc.com/) If you were cloned today, could you tomorrow kick your clone's butt?  That is what you train for.  From a career standpoint, will you be more skilled and capable tomorrow than your clone from today? [[Pat McNamara]]\n\n* Steven doesn't have to beat John or Nick out for a role or get more skilled than Kelsey Hightower or Donovan Brown.  But he does need to be better today than he was yesterday. \n\n* [Joseph Griffiths](https://nerd-journey.com/episode-018a-joseph-griffiths-interview-part-1/) had mentioned one hour per day can help you accomplish just this. [[Joseph Griffiths]]\n\n* There are no shortcuts. \n\n* Consider systems over goals.  Setup a system - a little code today, a little tomorrow, etc.   \n\n* Setting a goal to accomplish something in 6 months could lead to procrastination (i.e. a goal to write a C# program).  Listen to Steven's take on this, and consider \"what's good enough for today to make progress.\" \n\n* \"It's not that I need to be perfect tomorrow.  I need to be a little bit better than I was today.\" - Steven Murawski \n\n* John says Steven gets the full Nerd Journey bingo for his mantra of [Process over Outcomes](https://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/) [[Process over Outcomes]]\n\n* Steven reads and listens to many sources.  It is eerie how similar they are.  Steven mentioned [Manager Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/), which of course made John happy. [[Manager Tools]]\n\n* Much of the stuff they say tracks well with what others in radically different areas.  The terms may be different, but it is still similar. \n\n* Steven makes some additional book recommendations here. \n\n* [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050). [[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning]] [[Andy Hunt]]\n\n* [Behind Closed Doors: Secrets of Great Management](https://www.amazon.com/Behind-Closed-Doors-Management-Programmers/dp/0976694026) [[Behind Closed Doors]]\n\n* The patterns we build to work with and interact with software are not so different from those familiar models built to work with people. \n\n* There are relationships between all these fields of study.  Not everything maps to manufacturing, but much of it does.   \n\n* \"There is nothing new under the sun.\" - Ecclesiastes 1:9 \n\n* When we look at things in a different way, it feels new. \n\n* John remembers hearing \"do something every day\" from a [[Jerry Seinfeld]] documentary.  [[Comedian: Where Does the Comedy Come From?]]\n\n* Stand up comedians take a systematic approach to getting better as well. \n\n*  Analogies are not great for convincing people.  It's more of a tool to help you learn. \n\n* The job of a sales rep is to build relationships, which Steven sees as hard.  He would much rather do a random list of difficult tasks than make cold calls. \n\n* \"It's not the tool.   It's the system.  I've tried all the tools.  But I have to stick with a system.\" - Steven Murawski \n\n* Steven likes the mantra behind [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-David-Allen-audiobook/dp/B00005V7Q4), but you have to do the work to make the system work.  None of the systems will fix you.  This is the idea behind changing patterns. [[Getting Things Done]]\n\n* Sometimes we have to not care as much about a particular thing.   \n\n* The thing about systems is you do not have to succeed every day, but you do get better and more effective over time.  \n\n## 36:30 - A Podcaster and Community Manager \n\n* When Steven got into IT, he consumed all possible resources.  One of the podcasts he found early on was called [[A Couple of Admins Podcasting]]. \n\n* He remembers giving the hosts (Keith and Rich) some feedback at one point and was invited to be a guest on the show for an episode. \n\n* Steven was invited to be a regular host. \n\n* With 3 hosts, the name no longer truly fit, so after running a podcast, they ended up with [Mind of Root](http://www.mindofroot.com/about-2/).  [[Mind of Root]]\n\n* Steven used the podcast as a venue for talking to numerous people across the industry.  For example, they got Tom Limoncelli on the show at one point to talk about one of his books. \n\n* Due to job changes for some of the hosts, the podcast fizzled out.   \n\n* The show was about different technologies.  The need to have something to talk about on the show gave Steven a reason to dig into \"what's next.\" \n\n* A lot of Steven's career is a result of what he has gained from the tech community.  He feels it part of his responsibility to keep putting things back to help others build skills, learn new things, and find the next job that makes them happy. \n\n* John mentioned [[Giving Back|giving back]] to the community is what we wanted to do with Nerd Journey.  It's a little selfish in that we do it to conserve our own thoughts and ideas.  But the [[Giving Back]] part is the sharing of lessons / missteps. \n\n* Steven was also manager of a PowerShell community around the same time of getting into podcasting. \n\n* He had been active in the PowerShell community since it was in beta. \n\n* There was the .NET community, some SysAdmin user groups (though sporadic), some programming language-specific communities; they wanted to provide a centralized area for people looking for PowerShell blog posts, forum content, and related podcasts. \n\n* [[Don Jones]] (a fellow PowerShell MVP) was one of the drivers behind the creation of this community (and the formation of powershell.org). \n\n* After a while, the community fizzled, and powershell.org came along to help steward a sense of community and organize various events, etc. \n\n* Steven was kind of thrown into the community by some well meaning friends.  He learned a lot about what works and what does not from a community standpoint. \n\n* Steven spent time in several different communities in practice starting with the PowerShell community. \n\n* This got him speaking opportunities, chances to talk to product teams, chances to do training, etc. \n\n* The stuff for #LOPSA got him exposed to a number of in-person conferences at which he would do PowerShell trainings.  This is where he got to know the folks at Stack Overflow, which then led to a job down the road. \n\n* One of the folks there took his training class. \n\n* The connections built at these events built awareness and his network at the same time. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-107":{"title":"Episode 107","content":"\n# Episode 107\n\nWelcome to episode 107 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we have the third and final part of our conversation with Steven Murawski, where we discuss how Steven applied his expert beginner skills in major job transitions.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 11-17-2020 \n\nTopics - Applying the Beginner Mindset in Major Job Transitions [[Steven Murawski]]\n\n=============================================================== \n\n## 2:41 - Progressing from Stack Overflow to Chef to Microsoft \n\n* After being at Stack Overflow for 2 years and spending 6 months working on infrastructure as code with PowerShell Desired State Configuration (one of the first to have done this), he did a number of talks that allowed him to meet people outside of the Windows community. \n\n* He seemed to keep bumping into people from [Chef](https://www.chef.io/), and they were curious about what Steven was doing.  Stack Overflow was a [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) shop, but they didn't seem to care much about Windows. \n\n* Eventually the folks at Chef suggested Steven come work with them. \n\n* He had left Edgenet for Stack Overflow because it was Stack Overflow.  To be one of the Windows Engineers helping run one of the most popular Windows communities on the planet was really exciting (think 6 million page views per day). \n\n* All the admins at Stack Overflow knew at least one scripting language and one compiled language.  They built tools to help manage the environment better. \n\n* The opportunity at Chef came from a lot of time spent on configuration management (including speaking internationally). \n\n* He was offered a role as Technical Community Manager.  They wanted him to come onboard and talk about PowerShell and testing, etc. \n\n* He openly admitted throughout the interview process that he knew nothing about Chef.  They hired him to talk about PowerShell.  Many of the concepts he knew were required to have a successful configuration management experience. \n\n* After 5 months, Chef re-organized.  Steven then became a developer on the community engineering team responsible for helping shepherd open source projects, new contributions, and being a good open source citizen. \n\n* He had used some source control back at the police department which continued at his other employers (but in different forms). \n\n* His knowledge of PowerShell translated well to learning [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). \n\n* He was reading a lot of books and trying a lot of things (failing at times too).  But the improvement came quickly because he was not starting from zero knowledge of programming. \n\n* This was really getting into the product development space.  While he was an expert in many other areas, he did not have strong knowledge in Ruby, debugging, design patterns, and a number of other things. \n\n* There were a number of colleagues that helped him learn while they were able to leverage his experience with Windows. \n\n* Steven still gave talks, maintained customer connections through work with Pre-Sales Engineers, and did a lot of outbound communication. \n\n* He then met [[Donovan Brown]], who at the time was a Technical Sales Professional at Microsoft. \n\n* Microsoft was planning a product integration with Chef, and Steven worked with Donovan to build a demo that was later presented at an internal Microsoft conference. \n\n* Months later Donovan contacted Steven about being on a DevOps focused Advocacy team at Microsoft. \n\n* Leaving both Stack Overflow and Chef were opportunities for Steven to take his advocacy to the next level. \n\n* He went from configuration management as a side project to it becoming his full time focus to talking about DevOps, SRE, and all the things that could make someone's IT experience better as his day job. \n\n* This was all about increasing the scope of contribution and scope of impact. \n\n* The clarity of this goal came while Steven was at Stack Overflow and evaluating the opportunity at Chef. \n\n* This context helped him make the decision about the role at Microsoft.   \n\n* At Chef, he had just finished work on [Habitat](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-habitat/) and had spent a year developing in Rust as well as Ruby.  The opportunity to go to Microsoft seemed to come at a perfect transition point. \n\n* If timing was not flexible and he had been in the middle of a deliverable, he may not have made the move, or that would at least have made the decision harder. \n\n* The purpose matched what Steven felt was important to making a change in job. \n\n* Steven had opportunity to look at different roles at Microsoft in the past but never took one.  This would be the largest company he had ever joined (which made him a little nervous). \n\n* Listen to Steven's take on organization size, visibility into other organizations, and communication efficiencies and tools. \n\n* He was not sure that the flexibility he enjoyed at smaller organizations would follow a move to Microsoft. \n\n* There were some fan boy feelings about the people he would work with at Microsoft (i.e. [[Jeffrey Snover]]). \n\n* Steven told himself if it did not work out at Microsoft, he would be ok.  He was active in the community and had built a good network of people who knew his skill level and quality of work. \n\n* This existed because of the time Steven spent building it over the years. \n\n## 24:27 - Progression after Joining Microsoft \n\n* Steven has been with Microsoft for about 3 years now, starting as a Senior Cloud Advocate.  \n\n* This year he was promoted to #Principal (which is a band jump).  This takes time because you need people higher in the organization to advocate for you. \n\n* Opportunity at Microsoft is what you make of it. \n\n* Most organizations within are like a bunch of small shops.  There might be a product team with 10-15 engineers and a Product Manager.  Think of these as small, composed units. \n\n* For example, after Steven's first year they created a [[Developer Advocacy]] program.   \n\n* There was a division between MSDN and TechNet.  At the time, Steven used documentation from both areas. \n\n* This was fixed with docs.microsoft.com.  In today's world, having the two repositories did not make sense.  Putting all the technical documentation in one spot made a ton of sense.   \n\n* Whatever your role was, all of the documentation existed in one place. \n\n* A similar approach was taken with advocacy groups (i.e. all Developer Advocates, for example, were in a group to service the entirety of the community / customer base). \n\n* Steven got to help build the plan and shape the program for Operations Advocacy. \n\n* Steven speaks to a re-organization shortly after the Operations Advocacy program was formed.  These programs were originally separated by community areas. \n\n* The re-organization was separated based on audiences / types of customers (a bit more cross functional).  There was another re-organization about 5 months later. \n\n* The skills they hired people for were relevant across areas. \n\n* Steven is now a part of an organization called Methods and Practices.  This includes DevOps, SRE, Enterprise Systems and Tools, and Modern Infrastructure. \n\n* The broader team focus is helping customers adopt new operational practices through tools and online resources (documentation, videos, Microsoft Learn) without necessarily needing to reach out to someone at Microsoft. \n\n* Deciding what is next is something Steven wrestles with. \n\n* There are a number of immediate challenges in his current role, for example, that will create great sources for new content. \n\n* He has worked with his manager on key objectives and results and refining them for the team so they match the mission for the team, the organization as a whole, and the organizations above that. \n\n* The team recently took over the Azure DevOps blog and helps shepherd other content from inside Microsoft. \n\n* This was done in service of ensuring content was dispersed correctly and properly to the greater community. \n\n* There are a number of good opportunities internally and externally sitting right in front of Steven. \n\n* He has a number of things on his plate that will keep him busy for a while, but overall he is not sure. \n\n* Steven thinks an Engineering role sounds interesting and has an interest in getting back to shipping some software or maybe running a service. \n\n* We would love to come back and dig into some of these nuggets Steven has shared! \n\n* Steven would love to learn more about our stories because that is how he learns.   \n\n* John mentioned some of our previous check-in episodes. \n\n* Maybe we can add a navel gazing tag to our past episodes. \n\n* You can [connect with Steven on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/usepowershell/) or [reach out to

We're going to share our reading goals for the year, how we think about them, and how they can help us grow in some way. \n\n## 1:55 - John's Goals Based on Category \n\n* General Learning and Career Growth \n\n* [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://amzn.to/3rydtQQ) by Andy Hunt [[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning]] [[Andy Hunt]]\n\n* John has read this book before but not in a while.  He mentioned in as a book that has shaped his thinking in [Bonus Episode 8](https://nerd-journey.com/most-influential-books-on-my-thinking-john-white) from late 2019.   [[Bonus Episode 8]]\n\n* Other than some fundamental principles he remembers from it, he feels he needs to read it again to refresh his memory. \n\n* John enjoys re-reading books. \n\n* [The Ideal Team Player - How to Recognize and Cultivate The Three Essential Virtues](https://amzn.to/3a3n64g) by Patrick Lencioni [[The Ideal Team Player]] [[Patrick Lencioni]]\n\n* We reviewed another book by Lencioni in [Episode 87](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-lencionis-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/) called [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://amzn.to/2Oc6H4K) that was also quite good. [[Episode 87]] [[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team]]\n\n* John wants to hear Lencioni's thoughts on the team player concept. \n\n* The style of Lencioni's writings are usually business fable and easy to consume.  John plans to put this one early in his list to get a quick win. \n\n* Two Recommendations from [[Steven Murawski:]] \n\n* Our trilogy of interviews with Steven began with [Episode 107](https://nerd-journey.com/a-career-journey-through-the-microsoft-ecosystem-with-steven-murawski-part-1/). [[Episode 107]]\n\n* [Behind Closed Doors: Secrets of Great Management](https://amzn.to/3jvu2de) by [[Johanna Rothman]], [[Esther Derby]] [[Behind Closed Doors]] \n\n* Steven mentioned in his interview \"the patterns we build to work with and interact with software are not so different from those familiar models built to work with people\" in reference to this book. \n\n* We have to manage tasks and groups of peers even if we do not want to pursue management. \n\n* [How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big](https://amzn.to/36VuU64) by [[Scott Adams]] [[How to Fail at Almost Everything ans Still Win Big]] \n\n* John is a little hesitant on this one as the author doesn't sound like a great person in real life.  But the title remains intriguing. \n\n* John will check it out and report back. \n\n* [Success is in Your Sphere: Leverage the Power of Relationships to Achieve Your Business Goals](https://amzn.to/2ZcyZi5) by [Zvi Band](https://zvi.band/) [[Success is in Your Sphere]] [[Zvi Band]]\n\n* This one sounded intriguing based on the title. \n\n* [Strategic Relationships at Work: Creating Your Circle of Mentors, Sponsors, and Peers for Success in Business and Life](https://amzn.to/3a0rYH2) by [[Wendy Murphy]], [[Kathy Kram]]  [[Strategic Relationships at Work]]\n\n* This choice was inspired by our interviews with [[Ashley Connell]] that began in [Episode 96](https://nerd-journey.com/sponsorship-dreams-and-the-path-to-entrepreneurship-with-ashley-connell/).  [[Episode 96]]\n\n* Ashley shared the difference between a mentor and a sponsor, and John would like to grow his circle of good sponsors and mentors. \n\n* Any other books in this area / thought leadership is welcome advice to us. \n\n* [Feedback That Works: How to Build and Deliver Your Message](https://amzn.to/2OczSVm) by Center for Creative Leadership [[Feedback That Works]] [[Center for Creative Leadership]]\n\n* In his role at Google, John is involved in a lot of peer feedback and review.  He'd like to improve in this area. \n\n* Please send recommendations for providing good feedback John's way! \n\n* [The Art of Being Indispensable at Work](https://amzn.to/2NdqYGw) by Bruce Tulgan [[The Art of Being Indespensable at Work]] [[Bruce Tulgan]]\n\n* This is a title that seemed interesting to John as he definitely wants to be indispensable at work.  If he is able to read it he can report back. \n\n* [Empathy at Work](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/empathy-at-work/9781492050483/) by Sharon Steed [[Empathy at Work]] [[Sharon Steed]]\n\n* John likes to lead relationships with empathy.  If there is a book with a good model for doing this, he would really like to hear about it. \n\n* If you have read something covering this genre of empathy at work, DM us! \n\n* #Python \n\n* John has a technical goal for the year to formally adopt a programming language.  He chose Python because it seemed to fit the skills he wants to adopt in data engineering, analytics, big data, and machine learning. \n\n* [Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://amzn.to/3d7Om3x) by [[Zed A. Shaw]] [[Learn Python 3 the Hard Way]] \n\n* The author has covered a number of different languages. \n\n* The \"hard way\" is typing in the code rather than just doing a copy paste.  It allows you to experience the debugging process and better learn syntax as well as understand what commands do. \n\n* As we record this, John is a couple weeks into it. \n\n* [Clean Code in Python](https://amzn.to/36YSeQa) by [[Mariano Anaya]] [[Clean Code in Python]] \n\n* The idea of clean code is writing it in a way that is understandable. \n\n* John wants to be knowledgeable to be empathetic to customers doing development work. \n\n* One philosophy is document what you are doing extremely well with good comments.  An alternative philosophy is to write the code so it is very clear what you are trying to do and only write comments when something complex needs to be referenced outside the code. \n\n* The stretch for John is learn Python and conceptually understand clean code. \n\n* Computational Thinking \n\n* [Computational Thinking - A beginner’s guide to problem-solving and programming](https://amzn.to/3rykmBC) by [[Karl Beecher]]  [[Computational Thinking]]\n\n* Programming can be broken down into language syntax, what commands do, data structures, logic, etc.  Then there is the problem solving part.  Computational thinking is more focused on problem solving abstracted away from the languages (i.e. algorithmic way of solving problems). \n\n* John has not had any formal training in this area.  His goal is not to become a programmer but to gain a general skill to be empathetic to those who write code in their day jobs. \n\n* It would also be nice to solve problems he comes across on a daily basis with this type of thinking. \n\n* [Applied Computational Thinking with Python](https://amzn.to/3q5mMY3) by [[Sphia De Jesus]] and [[Dayrene Martinez]] [[Applied Computational Thinking with Python]] \n\n* John does not know anything about the book but would love to hear from anyone who has walked this path. \n\n* This choice and the previous seemed logical based on what John wanted to learn. \n\n* [[Data Science]] \n\n* [Data Science on the Google Cloud Platform](https://amzn.to/3tGdpAj) by [[Valliappa Lakshmana]] [[Data Science on the Google Cloud Platform]]\n\n* John is making a technology bet based on what he is hearing from his customers.   \n\n* He would love to hear about any recommendations that might be abstracted from a specific platform, especially if it is better than what he has chosen above. \n\n* Consumption Format - How will John Consume These? \n\n* John thinks the only book he can do in audio form is the Lencioni book (could be both audio and PDF format and use WhisperSync).  Maybe the Scott Adams book falls into this same category. \n\n* Most of the technical reads will probably be consumed in digital format.  John keeps a few physical books but not many these days. \n\n* He thinks 90% digital with 10% possibly audio. \n\n* Lots of these reads sound really interesting to Nick.  Maybe they can compare notes on progress in each list separate and apart from the show. \n\n* Maybe John could start blogging about those technical reads?  Nick would love to read some articles written by John on computational thinking. \n\n## 27:14 - Nick's Goals Based on Category \n\n* The General Philosophy \n\n* This is a stream of consciousness progression.  Nick went back and categorized the books he had read over the past couple of years and categorized them into several different areas.  It seemed to span a wide range of topics. \n\n* [[Deliberate Practice]] \n\n* Nick fell into this topic after reading [Moonwalking with Einstein](https://amzn.to/2OafJzd) by [[Joshua Foer]] in late 2020. [[Moonwalking With Einstein]]\n\n* This is practice with a focused intensity, repeating the doing, with fast feedback to develop mental representations. \n\n* Nick then read [Peak](https://amzn.to/36SLu6j) by [[Anders Ericsson]] and [[Robert Pool]] followed by [The Art of Learning](https://amzn.to/3rC2yFW) by [[Joshua Waitzkin]]. [[Peak]] [[The Art of Learning]]\n\n* Waitzkin made it to elite levels in multiple fields, and it was extremely interesting to hear how he was able to learn as a beginner and how he continually raised his expertise level. \n\n* Once Nick reads a really good book in a specific area he likes to read other books in that same area to get another viewpoint. \n\n* Nick found [this list of recommendations](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory) written by [[James Clear]].  There are 3 other books that Nick wants to read as a result. \n\n* [The Talent Code](https://amzn.to/3aG3uSw) by [[Dan Coyle]] [[The Talent Code]] \n\n* [Deep Work](https://amzn.to/3jDYfab) by [[Cal Newport]] [[Deep Work]] \n\n* [The Practicing Mind](https://amzn.to/3b2xIQb) by [[Thomas M. Sterner]]  [[The Practicing Mind]]\n\n* Mentoring / Career \n\n* [Tribe of Mentors](https://amzn.to/3a32EjH) by [[Tim Ferris]] [[Tribe of Mentors]]\n\n* There was a podcast at the end of the Audible version of Josh Waitzkin's book where Tim Ferris interviewed Josh. \n\n* This book is a collection of advice from a number of highly successful people in a number of industries. \n\n* John kind of wishes he had picked a Tim Ferris book and a Seth Godin book based on the discussion here. \n\n* [A Game Plan for Life](https://amzn.to/2MONsOj) by [[John Wooden]], [[Don Yaeger]], and [[John Maxwell]]  [[A Game Plan for Life]] \n\n* Don Yaeger was on a team call at VMware and spoke about how he met [[Michael Jordan]].  As a result of this call, Nick ended up getting to pick a book by Yeager and decided on the one about John Wooden. \n\n* John calls out that John Wooden's coaching methodology is heavily referenced in The Talent Code. \n\n* Biographies \n\n* Nick really enjoys this genre and likes to learn about people's lives whether a sports figure, thought leader, successful person in business / technology, etc. \n\n* He read [[Ed Catmull]]'s book [Creativity, Inc.](https://amzn.to/3cPlixs) at the end of 2020 and loved it (highlighted as [Nick's favorite book of 2020](https://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2021/01/02/my-2020-reading-list/)).  Ed was one of the founders of Pixar and had a dream to create a digitally animated film.  [[Creativity Inc.]]\n\n* This led Nick to a book on [[Steve Jobs]] (who acquired Pixar) called [Becoming Steve Jobs](https://amzn.to/3a29Yfo).  It was a story of how Jobs grew and changed as a leader from the time when he founded Apple to leaving Apple and starting Next to acquiring Pixar, helping it become successful, selling it to Disney, and eventually returning to Apple to make it a success.  Nick just finished this one (highly recommend). [[Becoming Steve Jobes]]\n\n* You can learn from people's mistakes / successes from reading their story. \n\n* [George Lucas: A Life](https://amzn.to/3a2bVso) by [[Brian Jay Jones]] [[George Lucas: A Life]] \n\n* Nick is a big Star Wars fan, and this also has a connection to Pixar. \n\n* [The Ride of a Lifetime](https://amzn.to/3d1dwRj) by [[Bob Iger]] [[Ride of a Lifetime]]\n\n* Iger was responsible for the launch of Shanghai Disney and shares lessons learned in his career up to being the Disney CEO. \n\n* [Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination](https://amzn.to/3aHNqzS) [[Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination]]\n\n* This may have come from Nick watching [The Imagineering Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imagineering_Story) on Disney Plus. [[The Imagineering Story]]\n\n* [The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution](https://amzn.to/3tOgLRO) by [[Walter Isaacson]] [[The Innovators]]\n\n* This is supposed to be a historical account of the people who influenced the creation of the computer and the internet and seemed interesting. \n\n* After reading [Andre Agassi's biography](https://amzn.to/3tzCzR4) last year, it seems natural to at some point read [A Champion's Mind: Lessons from a Life in Tennis](https://amzn.to/3cYlsm6). [[Andrei Agassi]] [[A Champion's Mind]]\n\n* [Michael Jordan: The Life](https://amzn.to/3qa5ppi) [[Michael Jordan: The Life]]\n\n* Nick watched a lot of Bulls basketball as a kid. \n\n* [Gunslinger: The Remarkable, Improbable, Iconic Life of Brett Favre](https://amzn.to/3rFvaOz) by [[Jeff Pearlman]]  [[Gunslinger: The Remarkable, Improbable, Iconic Life of Brett Favre]]\n\n* This could have been a product of Audible social engineering. \n\n* [Bruce Lee: A Life](https://amzn.to/3q4FHCt) by [[Matthew Polly]] [[Bruce Lee: A Life]] \n\n* This supposed to be some of the untold story of what Bruce Lee was like. \n\n* [Shoe Dog](https://amzn.to/3cVKhiI) by [[Phil Knight]] [[Shoe Dog]] \n\n* This was a recommendation from [[Paul Green]].  Our interviews with Paul start in [Episode 93](https://nerd-journey.com/leadership-and-supporting-employee-potential-with-paul-green/).  [[Episode 93]]\n\n* [Paul: A Biography](https://amzn.to/39YOOiq) by [[N.T. Wright]] [[Paul: A Biography]] \n\n* Thinking \n\n* [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://amzn.to/3jxMlOX) by [[Donella H. Meadows]] [[Thinking in Systems: A Primer]] \n\n* This has been referenced in a number of different books Nick has read as has the next choice. \n\n* [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://amzn.to/2NaWR2w) by [[Daniel Kahnerman]] [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]  \n\n* Creativity \n\n* [Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential Within Us All](https://amzn.to/3rH8fm1) by [[Tom Kelley]], [[David Kelley]]  [[Creative Confidence]]\n\n* Exercise and Health \n\n* After reading [Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain](https://amzn.to/2OccMOC), Nick is choosing [The Joy of Movement: How Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage](https://amzn.to/3cYmGOe) by [[Kelly McGonigal]]  [[Spark]] [[The Joy of Movement]] \n\n* Parenting \n\n* Some of the authors here were cited in other parenting books Nick has read in the last year. \n\n* [The Yes Brain: How to Cultivate Courage, Curiosity, and Resilience in Your Child](https://amzn.to/3a3VGem) by [[Daniel Siegel]], [[Tina Payne Bryson]] [[The Yes Brain]] \n\n* [Are My Kids on Track?: The 12 Emotional, Social, and Spiritual Milestones Your Child Needs to Reach](https://amzn.to/3a4ySLm) by [[Sissy Goff]]  [[Are My Kids on Track?]]\n\n* [Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child: The Heart of Parenting](https://amzn.to/2YYLYUj) by [[John Gottman]]  [[Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child]]\n\n* Emotional Intelligence \n\n* Nick has not read a book on this yet. \n\n* [Emotional Intelligence Blueprint: Mastery Bible, Practical Guide on Becoming a Social Skills Chameleon, Able to Dominate Any Room with Charisma and Influencing Leadership Skills](https://amzn.to/2N7tyy7) by [[Mark Page]] [[Emotional Intelligence Blueprint]] \n\n* [Emotional Intelligence for Sales Leadership: The Secret to Building High-Performance Sales Teams](https://amzn.to/3oXJIqU) by [[Colleen Stanley]] [[Emotional Intelligence for Sales Leadership]] \n\n* The focus on leadership was interesting from the standpoint of understanding how leaders need to be emotionally intelligent. \n\n* Technical \n\n* Nick did not have a specific technical read.  More of the things he has read about haven't been super focused on specific technologies. \n\n* Nick would love a technical recommendation on serverless technologies or software development processes from the greater community.  \n\n* Consumption \n\n* These will likely be Audible except for those which are extremely technical. \n\n* We are aiming high.  Not every book we read will be on these lists, and not every book on these lists will be something we read this year. \n\n## 49:17 - Ideas on Places to Find Book Recommendations \n\n* Friends, family, colleagues \n\n* Nick is interested in why people read specific books and why it was interesting to them. \n\n* Understanding people's influences can help you understand them better. \n\n* Follow [LinkedIn Book Club](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=linkedinbookclub), and tag your posts with #linkedinbookclub \n\n* John pulls up the link live and finds a potential good read immediately. \n\n* Reddit \n\n* [Reddit Book Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/) - all genres \n\n* [Book Suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/) - a place to ask for recommendations but not genre specific \n\n* [General Books Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/) \n\n* [Nonfiction Book Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/nonfictionbookclub/) \n\n* The book club forums seemed to have weekly recommendations, asking for people to share their favorite book in the last year. \n\n* Twitter is an option also \n\n* John likes to read books that are cited as a source In a book he's reading. \n\n* Friends / family members have also made some very good book recommendations to John based on his interests. \n\n## 55:33 - The Importance of Books \n\n* If you are not reading books you may be missing out on some good content.  Nick did not do this when he was in IT Operations due to a feeling of no spare time. \n\n* He never really read books separate and apart from articles, training, blog posts, etc. \n\n* John likes things that challenge his mental models of the world / how things work or present a model he has not previously considered. \n\n* One of the things that is most enjoyable is having an assumption he has taken apart and analyzed. \n\n* His nonfiction reading has been science focused in the past as a result.  The learning genre we've discussed is in this area. \n\n* John has been a lifelong book worm and recently switched over to audio books (easier to consume while driving, etc.).  He still loves reading both fiction and nonfiction. \n\n* Go back and listen to the episodes covering books that have shaped our thinking: \n\n* John - [Bonus Episode 8](https://nerd-journey.com/most-influential-books-on-my-thinking-john-white/) [[Bonus Episode 8]]\n\n* Nick - [Bonus Episode 9](https://nerd-journey.com/most-influential-books-on-my-thinking-nick-korte/) [[Bonus Episode 9]]\n\n* John is a little judgy about not reading. \n\n* Nick was a decent reader as a kid but really never found something interesting until someone gave him the first Harry Potter book, which led him to really enjoy fantasy fiction. \n\n* As we learn more, we will make connections across fiction and nonfiction works that can help us in other areas. \n\n* John has a back burner project to create a list of books he read at each age which led him to be who he is today. \n\n* Nick and John give some book recommendations for people who enjoyed Harry Potter. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-109":{"title":"Episode 109","content":"\n# Episode 109\n\nWelcome to episode 109 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss dealing with grief and loss with Mike Burkhart.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 01-28-2021 \n\nTopics – [[Personal Grief]] and Loss \n\n================================ \n\n## 03:39 - A Different Conversation with Mike \n\n* [Mike Burkhart](https://twitter.com/vmikeb) is back as our first repeat guest!   [[Mike Burkhart]]\n\n* If you remember, both previous interviews with Mike made our top 10 most downloaded episodes when we ran the stats during [Episode 100](https://nerd-journey.com/one-hundredth-episode-reflections-on-career-podcasting/). [[Episode 100]]\n\n* This discussion with Mike is very different from our previous episodes with him. \n\n## 6:18 – The Event That Triggered a Career Change \n\n* In our previous discussions with Mike, he had just taken a role at Nutanix as a Solution Architect in the Education space building content and improving lab delivery. #Nutanix\n\n* Many other certifications were created during his time there. \n\n* Mike misses his former co-workers at Nutanix greatly. \n\n* In June of 2020, Mike and his wife lost a child at childbirth. \n\n* The pregnancy was normal, and so was the birth.  Thier son was born dead. \n\n* Many people experience loss of people they love, but loss of a child is confusing.  It's loss of potential, loss of possibility. \n\n* You never factor in the possible death of your child as you go through a pregnancy. \n\n* It's really strange to know the company policy for paternity leave but have to go back to your boss and ask for [[bereavement leave]] instead.  Paternity leave is 1 month, and bereavement leave was only a few days. \n\n* Likely no amount of time will be enough to allow us to grieve. \n\n* Mike's boss have him a month off and offered to do whatever was needed to support Mike and his family. \n\n* After this happened, Mike cried from the minute he woke up, during eating, while watching his 4-year-old son, and while taking his dog out.  To know that depth of loss is eye opening. \n\n* Mike realized if he could feel completely helpless, anyone else could too. \n\n* While his wife felt anger, he felt only sorrow and sadness. \n\n* Everyone at Nutanix was sending e-mails, texts, making calls, and doing what they could to help. \n\n* If you are suffering from grief over loss, reach out to others to get the support you need. \n\n* Here's a pro tip for friends experiencing grief:  Ask how you can help. \n\n* At the time, Mike didn't really know how to ask for help.  He was never suicidal but had to work through the grief. \n\n* At the end of the month of time off, Mike had the option to take more time (but unpaid).  If you need that time, take it. \n\n* Grief is complicated because life does not stop.  You still need to shower, you still need to eat, and you still need to take your dog out. \n\n* Mike has a 4-year-old who didn't fully understand what had happened, often times asking \"Dad, why are you so sad?\" \n\n* At a certain point, you may need to seek [[therapy]].   \n\n* Even after the month off, Mike wasn't functional enough to be effective at work. \n\n* The hours were long upon Mike's return to work (sometimes 16 hour days to make ends meet and complete projects). \n\n* Listen to the story about a specific night Mike was in charge of putting his son to bed despite needing to meet a work deadline. \n\n* This caused Mike to tender his resignation that night. \n\n* He had a financial planner that had helped ensure the family was in a place where Mike could quit his job.  This was an emergency that needed immediate attention. \n\n* Mike was ineffective and not happy with his outcomes.  Work does not stop, and he could not take the stress.   \n\n* There is no getting over grief but only working through it.  There is no \"unlosing\" of something.  Focus on the healing and the integration with your grief. \n\n* In an emergency, it is all about survival. \n\n* Reach out to your anchors (people, places, etc.) that root you to your humanity. These are the things that ground you and balance you. \n\n* Mike gives a great analogy about a spinning top with a weight on it. \n\n* We talk about being proactive vs. reactive all the time.   \n\n* John mentions we cannot judge ourselves for our emotional reactions.  We hope we put emotional funds in the bank to get through hard times, but it does not necessarily. \n\n* Mike wanted to be strong as the man of the house.  This goes back to our conversations of toxic masculinity. \n\n* It's tough to step aside from your own feelings and really analyze what is happening. \n\n* Nick makes the point that Mike had to help his 4-year-old through this tough time while he was also experiencing it. \n\n* Listen to the story of how Mike's 4-year-old acted expressed the situation while playing. \n\n* The natural state before learning about cultural norms is to talk things out / or play them out. \n\n## 33:41  - Experiencing Stages of Grief \n\n* Stages of grief were very strange for Mike.  After quitting his job, Mike started to see a grief counselor. \n\n* \"Life does not get easier.  It gets less hard.\" - Mike Burkhart \n\n* There were days where he could not get out of bed. \n\n* Days when Mike did not feel awful made him feel guilt over not feeling worse. \n\n* In the United States, 1 out of 160 children die in childbirth, which means there are 25,000 – 40,000 parents grieving the loss of a child each year. \n\n* This is not a risk we want to consider, but it does happen. \n\n* When this even happened to Mike and people would express their condolences, he didn't care.  It was, more than anything, because he felt others did not understand what he was experiencing. \n\n* He still isn't sure why. \n\n* There are communities formed around the loss of a child to help those suffering. \n\n* This feeling of grief is like nothing Mike has experienced, and his grief counselor is one of his favorite people. \n\n* Mike needed to know that someone else has felt the same as him.  Being in the state he was in was like being in molasses. \n\n* Birth is a hectic, nerve wracking process.  Add death to that mix, and it's like someone unhitched a train which ran into a mountain with no tunnel. \n\n* It's possible for people to recognize you are in pain without being empathetic.  John makes the point it is challenging to ask for a Sherpa to help get through the process. \n\n* In Western culture death is taboo.  We tend to say we are sorry for someone's loss, but if we have a moment with the person, ask that person to tell you about the person they lost. \n\n* To reach out to someone who is grieving, to really be helpful, give the person what they need or ask for and not necessarily what you think they want.   \n\n* It is important to set boundaries with others when you are grieving.  Say no to things not helpful. \n\n* This is part of the reason Mike wanted to be able to speak to others who have experienced the same loss as his family did. \n\n* Mike shares some things not to say to people experiencing this time of grief. \n\n* Is asking someone what they need like giving the person homework?  See [Bonus EP 10](https://nerd-journey.com/supporting-colleagues-of-color/) for more on this. [[Bonus Episode 10]]\n\n* \"I need you to come up with a way for me to support you\" can be a [[homework assignment]]. \n\n* Sometimes the person just needs you to go away.  You are giving the gift of solitude or space. \n\n* Mike didn't know how to respond to this type of question. \n\n* Think about the basic needs of others during grief (food, Kleenex, etc.). \n\n* Many times this depends on your relationship with the person suffering. \n\n* Mike mentions [The 5 Love Languages](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts/dp/080241270X) by Gary Chapman as helpful resource on understanding how others give and receive love.  [[The 5 Love Languages]] [[Gary Chapman]]\n\n* Keep in mind multiple love languages apply to people. \n\n* One of the things Mike appreciated most during his struggles was when people would bring food. \n\n* Mike and family had a doula committed to working with them who helped with laundry, childcare, and even gave massages. \n\n* This level of grief takes a toll on the body. \n\n* Consider the most basic level of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) when trying to help others. [[Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs]]\n\n* Another taboo of death is a hesitation to be around others who are grieving. \n\n* There are many models which can be leveraged to offer help, but many people use avoidance (the worst option). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. ","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-11":{"title":"Episode 11","content":"\n# Episode 11\n\nOriginal Recording Date 2018-07-17 \n\nTopics \n\n1:05 We launched! \n\nMore contact information \n\n[http://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2018/07/17/two-nerds-on-a-journey/](http://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2018/07/17/two-nerds-on-a-journey/)  \n\n[http://nerd-journey.com](http://nerd-journey.com/) \n\n[http://facebook.com/NerdJourneyPodcast](http://facebook.com/NerdJourneyPodcast) \n\nShould we be on Instagram? \n\n3:55 10 More Questions to Ask at the End of an Interview to Stand Out \n\n-   10 (More) Questions to Ask at the End of an Interview to Stand Out [https://jobs.washingtonpost.com/article/10-more-questions-to-ask-at-the-end-of-an-interview-to-stand-out/](https://jobs.washingtonpost.com/article/10-more-questions-to-ask-at-the-end-of-an-interview-to-stand-out/) \n    \n-   What Qualities Would A Person Need To Succeed In This Position? \n    \n-   Can You Give Me An Example Of What I Would Be Working On If I Started Tomorrow? \n    \n    -

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we present the second half of our conversation with Mike Burkhart's journey, dealing with personal grief. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 01-28-2021 \n\nTopics – [[Grief]], Family Dynamics, and Lifelines \n\n============================================== \n\nThis is the second part of our conversation with Mike. The first part is [episode 109](https://nerd-journey.com/dealing-with-personal-loss-and-grief-with-mike-burkhart/). [[Mike Burkhart]] [[Episode 109]] [[Stillbirth]]\n\n## 3:30 - Revisiting the Needs of Those in Grief \n\n* Did Mike want people to stop walking on eggshells and treat him normally at some point? \n\n* In truth people do not know how to respond. \n\n* As a grieving person, be courageous to address your own emotions.  Go there.  It may take a counselor, a therapist, a close friend, or a support group. \n\n* You must work at it. \n\n* The process at times felt like work to Mike. \n\n* To help someone experiencing grief, you also need to be brave enough to say \"it's not about me or how awkward I feel.\"  It is about serving someone else. \n\n* Mike likes John's thought on giving people a menu of options. \n\n* Listen to Mike's story about some ministers who came to visit him at the hospital right after his son was declared deceased.  They offered to sit in silence with him. \n\n* Mike also shared the story of a nurse who tried to comfort him, but it was not what he needed at the time despite her genuine manner.   \n\n* He could not accept this from her at the time and needed someone to come and sit in silence with him like the ministers did. \n\n* Offering to sit in silence while someone cries can really help, even if it is weird for you. \n\n## 12:12 – Changing Family Dynamics and [[External Support]] \n\n* A stillborn child changes the dynamic of a marriage.   \n\n* Mike's wife had just given birth at home, and he was at the hospital filling out all the necessary paperwork while she recovered. \n\n* He had time to think about it and was afraid he might lose his wife.  You tend to think the worst because the worst just happens. \n\n* Mike's wife was wheeled into the hospital to get the official news. \n\n* Acceptance is crucial during grief.  People will do and say many things during this time.  Mike and his wife had nothing but acceptance and understanding with each other. \n\n* It was ok to be angry.  Apologize and get past it. \n\n* Everyone is experiencing grief from their own viewpoint. \n\n* A pregnant woman's experience is unique to her as an individual that will be different than the experience of the father. \n\n* Not having a baby to hold and nurse caused his wife great pain. \n\n* Mike feels lucky to be a parent to still have one living child.  He had to focus his efforts on the things they have. \n\n* Happiness is gratitude.  Gratitude is acknowledging the things in your life and the joy they bring. \n\n* Mike didn't want to talk to anyone and was a bit of a hermit, but he did send a message out on Twitter. \n\n* He never could have imagined the outpouring of contact from people and would like to thank the community. \n\n* People offered to bring food, babysit, etc.   \n\n* People sent DMs saying they had been through the same experience and that they were there to support Mike when he needed it. \n\n* Sharing human experiences in life helps others.  This podcast is Mike's way of reaching back. \n\n* In times of extreme grief you may not feel like showering (kind of like having depression), and other self-care items fall away. \n\n* After suffering loss like this you don't know how to take care of yourself. \n\n* It was challenging to keep up a constant bedtime routine.  Mike's son would tell him it was time to put him to bed. \n\n## 29:44 – Getting Back to Work \n\n* Mike is a Cloud Solutions Architect at [Elevate Technology Partners](https://letselevate.tech/) out of Grand Rapids, Michigan. #ElevateTechnologyPartners\n\n* The owner of the company was a friend of a mutual friend of Mike's ([[Jenifer Slabaugh]]). \n\n* Jen had previously approached Mike about this company starting at one point. \n\n* The company owner (Josh) reached out to Mike about working a project for Elevate near the end of 2020. \n\n* Josh would check in with Mike daily because he knew Mike was struggling. \n\n* This guy was basically a stranger who was kind enough to go the distance in supporting Mike, even praying for him. \n\n* Josh sent Mike a song about not losing hope when all else is lost that was extremely helpful. \n\n* It is imperative to be open to the fact that things can get better / less hard. \n\n* You learn to get up, take a shower, and that you even enjoy taking the dog outside. \n\n* For an employer (Josh) to reach out and \"be real\" in offering a helping hand to someone in Mike's situation was amazing.  Josh allowed Mike to make the call about how much he could handle and when he could handle it. \n\n* At first Mike was hesitant to start work because of his state of mind, but Josh kept asking. \n\n* Mike wishes the same experience or better for anyone else out there. \n\n* Listen to Mike's explanation of both sides of \"I don't deserve this.\" \n\n* Have the humility to accept goodness in your life in whatever form that takes. \n\n* If overwhelmed by emotion and experience, it's ok.   \n\n* Being given the lifeline and being told to just keep going helped. \n\n* Mike started writing throughout this process, and it has been therapeutic.  There is not a lot of material out there for fathers going through a similar experience. \n\n* Was the return to work a refreshing sense of normalcy? \n\n* Mike even enjoyed going on Sales calls after going back to work.  He's still having fun with it.  The mantra is \"do good work.\" \n\n* Mike has been enabled to be an advisor and advocate for what the customer actually needs. \n\n* Solving difficult problems can be an organizational change (a process, etc.) and does not always align to a product. \n\n* Distractions are welcome.  Mike reconnected with his identity as a worker and provider with a very gentle onramp at his own pace. \n\n* Mike was able to dictate his own pace. \n\n* Adding the working routine in too early can be detrimental to your healing process.  It certainly didn't work for Mike. \n\n* Many folks say in a situation like Mike's there has to be a break from who you were entirely in certain areas. \n\n* Find where your experience fits again.  You find something to live for and pursue it. \n\n* Mike is grateful for what the loss opened his eyes up to, realizing the importance giving back. \n\n* We're happy to hear Mike is in a better place. \n\n* Nick was initially hesitant to approach Mike about this episode but so glad he did. \n\n* Mike agreed the topic needed to be discussed. \n\n* It is always valuable to share experiences. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-111":{"title":"Episode

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss Technical Sales career progression with Caitlyn Bryan.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 02-08-2021 \n\nTopics – Breaking In, Progressing to the Field, and Reflecting on Women in Tech \n\n=========================== \n\n## 03:35 – Getting into the Tech Industry \n\n* [Caitlyn Bryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlynfitzgerald/) is an Enterprise Client Executive at VMware based in Dallas.   [[Caitlyn Bryan]] #VMware \n\n* In college, Caitlyn struggled to understand technology and wanted to take a course.  She ended up pursuing a track that included coding and SAP software, which she found fascinating. \n\n* But, she enjoyed the social aspect most of all. \n\n* With a Marketing major and minor in Computer Information Systems, she wasn't sure where to go next. \n\n* Her sister's friend worked for a vendor and shared an opportunity with a vendor in a Sales role.  Caitlyn really enjoyed it and didn't previously realize this industry existed. \n\n* Just a few years later she started at VMware (where she has been for 6 years now).  She enjoys the travel aspect of her role and getting to meet different people. \n\n* Caitlyn stumbled into the tech industry and is always interested in hearing how others found their way into it as well. \n\n* There may not be a typical path to become a Technology Sales Professional that is field facing. \n\n* Caitlyn spent the first few years working on the inside (customer contact made via phone) learning the role.  [[Inside sales]] allows you to gain some much needed experience, supports career growth out to the field, and allows you to benefit from working in an office (pre-COVID, at least) environment that supports collaboration with like-minded peers. \n\n* Being a part of the inside Sales team allowed Caitlyn to gain additional insight into the [[work culture]] at VMware.  There were birthday celebrations, quarter kickoffs, visits from executives and Marketing, etc. \n\n* There are operational learning advantages to starting on the inside.  Imagine being able to lean over to someone more experienced in the next cube and ask for help, feedback, or insight. \n\n* Caitlyn had the chance to be a coach for newly hired inside Sales personnel and was energized by the talent coming into the company. \n\n## 11:25 – Progressing to [[Field Sales]] \n\n* What makes someone want to progress from an inside role to a field facing role? \n\n* Some people may not have field aspirations or really enjoy the inside role. \n\n* Caitlyn was passionate about deals and taking the lead role.  She liked the personal aspect of sitting with customers in person and building camaraderie with them.   \n\n* There is a compensation difference in moving to the field versus the inside. \n\n* Field roles are usually specific to a geographic region and may require you to relocate.  Some people may prefer to stay on the inside and not have to relocate. \n\n* John gives an illustration of how challenging getting a field role in a specific area can be.  In Austin, for example, there are many tech companies with a presence in the area and thus creates some natural competition among internal employees looking to progress and anyone outside the company looking to move into a field role. \n\n* Caitlyn mentioned it is very difficult to make the jump from inside to the field.  It's likely easier to transfer inside the same company. \n\n* Caitlyn was able to gain some experience making field visits while still working on the inside.  This was helpful to her resume for consideration when she did move to the field. \n\n* One of her former managers created a formal progression program to help personnel progress from inside to field. \n\n* Before VMware Caitlyn was looking for a culture of building up talent.  These are the types of programs to consider when you're evaluating a new company. \n\n* No one really leaves tech unless they want a drastic change.  There is so much knowledge and not a lot of brand new talent coming into the field.  We need to progress our people but at the same time bring in new blood. \n\n* Nurturing opportunities is very important (getting mentors and network building). \n\n* John gives the example of Oracle's system and it being very much like a master / apprentice (i.e. learning by doing and by seeing someone model it for you).   \n\n* Listen as Caitlyn shares an example of letting new employees ride along with her in Dallas / Fort Worth (part of VMware's Academy program for Salespeople, Solution Engineers, and others).  This is a great opportunity for the new person to learn and for the seasoned employee to learn too. \n\n## 26:11 – Reflecting on [[Women in Technology]] \n\n* Women in technology are extremely underrepresented.   \n\n* Some benefits are: \n\n* It's easy to find a female mentor. \n\n* There are no lines to wait for the bathroom at technology conferences. \n\n* Getting more girls interested in STEM could help, but many people don't even know the opportunities exist. \n\n* Be willing to coach up our children and community to create awareness. \n\n* You feel like you need to have a tough exterior in order to become the alpha and not seem like you are leading from an emotional / irrational state. \n\n* Most people in Caitlyn's experience have been wonderful to work with, but there are some who might think you are there to deliver the coffee. \n\n* Listen to Caitlyn's story from early in her career about getting asked to go pick up coffee.  \"I'm not there to be the waitress.\" \n\n* It's a strange delineation when you're one of the few / the only female in the room.   \n\n* Listen to Nick's story about someone shadowing him who volunteered to go get lunch. \n\n* As a woman, you want to take care of people and make them comfortable.  You think about things like timing for lunch, for example.   \n\n* Caitlyn had to draw an extreme line in the sand on this. \n\n* Listen to John's story about a similar uncomfortable situation. \n\n* In Caitlyn's story about the coffee, a senior leader from the customer made one of his employees go and get coffee, mentioning Caitlyn was the host only. \n\n* In Sales, you want to take care of your customers.  You're probably an extrovert.  Being a woman and wanting to continuously provide value means you don't want to be put in a weird role. \n\n* John mentions the host of an event does not deliver drinks to people (i.e. not a service person). \n\n* What about other issues for women in technology? \n\n* There is always a need for more female speakers.  If you don't see someone like you in sessions at conferences, you may not believe you can follow a similar path. \n\n* Caitlyn gave an example of a weeklong internal conference in which not a single woman was a presenter.  She called it out to her leadership as a major gap. \n\n* This stood out to her so clearly and was mind blowing that this could happen in the last 10 years.  The next conference she attended, there were more female representatives. \n\n* Speaking out for diversity is critical.  We have some work to do. [[Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion]]\n\n* John mentions a good way to judge an organization is their response to feedback.  It's more difficult to take a step back and consider a blind spot.  No one wants to call their baby ugly, but we need to be vocal about how we fix these things. \n\n* Right now Caitlyn has another female on her team after being the only one. \n\n* Women can help support and find qualified candidates by evangelizing and spreading the word about the tech industry. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on

[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss a personal experience with pregnancy during a tech career in the second half of our conversation with Caitlyn Bryan.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 02-08-2021 \n\nTopics – Pregnancy During a Technical Career \n\n============================================ \n\n[Caitlyn Bryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlynfitzgerald/) is an Enterprise Client Executive at VMware based in Dallas. Catch the first half of our conversation with her in [Episode 111](https://nerd-journey.com/a-career-in-technical-sales-with-caitlyn-bryan-part-1-2/).  [[Pregnancy]] [[Caitlyn Bryan]] [[Episode 111]]\n\n## 02:36 – Forced Leave and [[Unplugging from Work|Unplugging]] \n\n* It's a good idea to check out a company's #benefits before joining.  Caitlyn's current employer (VMware) gives 18 weeks paid maternity / [[Parental Leave|paternity leave]].  This also goes for adoption. \n\n* Caitlyn's son was born premature by 2 months, so her day-to-day came to a screeching halt. \n\n* She ended up with pre-eclampsia and was forced to be on bed rest for 3 weeks.   \n\n* When she called her boss to tell him the issue, he said she was to stop working and focus on her health and her baby's health (very supportive). \n\n* The 18 weeks did not start until after Caitlyn's son was out of the NICU.  She was on leave for a total of 6 months. \n\n* The culture of Caitlyn's employer supports focusing on family first, and the support of her management chain helped force her to keep that focus during this time. \n\n* In Sales, you are always on and need to be there to support your customers.  For Caitlyn, turning everything off so suddenly was a real challenge.   [[Unplugging from Work]]\n\n* She had to take e-mail off her phone to help here. \n\n* Listen to the fun anecdote from one of Caitlyn's customers on this. \n\n* From a maternity leave standpoint she was completely taken care of. \n\n* It was great to completely power down, and once her son arrived, it was not a problem. \n\n* When you're used to being in charge or being \"the warrior,\" you wonder how everything else can still be ok without you.  It's kind of a humble yourself moment. \n\n* Caitlyn was thankful she took the entire leave.  She has seen so many people who only took a certain chunk, and they never could find an exit moment to take the rest. \n\n* Caitlyn's husband only got 2 weeks of leave and had to go back to work soon after their son came home.  Their family lives in another state.  Amazon Prime came to the rescue. \n\n* Check in on your maternity leave from a personal perspective, and don't be afraid to take it. \n\n* Caitlyn was afraid of her pregnancy being perceived as weakness. \n\n* Was there anxiety when asking to take the maternity leave early? \n\n* Caitlyn had fought so hard to get to this point in her career, and part of her did not want to give up on the projects in flight and the customers depending on her.  She didn't want to skip a beat and wanted to be able to jump right back in where she left off. \n\n* She had some reservations about revealing she was pregnant. \n\n* At one point she went to club based on her great performance.  Not long after this, she learned she was pregnant. \n\n* The first trimester was many weeks of being extremely tired and craving sugar.   \n\n* The VMworld conference was coming up soon, and she had over 30 customers to host.  In addition to this, Caitlyn had volunteered to help train some new hires. \n\n* She thinks it was pure momentum that kept her going. \n\n* There was a certain level of fear about taking a step back at this point. \n\n* Maybe this is a sign of where gaps are in female representation. \n\n* Luckily she built in a couple of days between the conference and training the new hires to relax with her sister. \n\n* Caitlyn is so glad she did go because it allowed her to connect with customers and peers, especially other women in technology across the globe. \n\n* How long to really be disconnected? \n\n* Caitlyn had to forcefully make herself take e-mail off her phone.  Listen to her story about working while she was on vacation in Venice. \n\n* It probably took about 3 months to really unplug. \n\n* She realized that 6 months away in the tech world is an eternity.  Her employer had acquired multiple companies, and there were thousands of e-mails waiting on her. \n\n* Caitlyn hid her laptop to remove temptation. \n\n* She repositioned her office to make it look less enticing. \n\n* Once her son had gained weight and was sleeping through the night she felt like it was time to go back to work. \n\n* Before this experience, she really only knew one person who had pre-eclampsia. \n\n## 25:35 – Coming Back \n\n* Many times the fear is coming back in a different position.  Are there other fears? \n\n* When Caitlyn made the first call to her boss, she had the #1 performing territory.  There was a feeling that she might be letting the team back. \n\n* Her boss was very reassuring and addressed the concerns.  A peer of hers covered the customer base in her absence. \n\n* Caitlyn had decided a 5 year goal was progressing to Enterprise Field Rep.  She went from 2 different inside Sales roles to a field role in the Commercial segment. But an opportunity in Enterprise came up just before she returned from leave. \n\n* She had to call her current boss and tell him about the opening that came up in the Dallas area. \n\n* Caitlyn was trying to figure out when she could interview between nursing, naps, and the dog barking.    \n\n* The irrational fear of being replaced was substituted for another challenge – moving to an entirely new set of customers and a new role. \n\n* \"Just because you are on maternity leave does not mean you are benched.\" - Caitlyn Bryan \n\n* Being on maternity leave can be a good time to evaluate career and make sure it is in line with your goals.  Look for internal transfers, for example. \n\n* Caitlyn has been back since August 2020, and her son is about to turn 1.  Before the maternity leave, she was way off balance. \n\n* She recently joined a book club and is making a conscious effort to spend time in other areas. \n\n* To get over the anxiety of learning new operational tools implemented while she was away and all of the acquisitions her company made, she really had to lean on others for support. \n\n* There was no more heavy driving or hopping on planes to visit customers because of the pandemic.  The new role will require less travel and supports Caitlyn's family life better than her previous role. \n\n* Caring for a small child is a challenge in and of itself as a new parent. \n\n* Caitlyn mentioned as a new mom it is important to communicate your needs.  Raise your hand if you need something or need a break.  As a woman, needing a break from something may appear as a sign of weakness.  Learn to ask, and learn to delegate. [[Working Motherhood]]\n\n* Figure out how to take moments for you. \n\n* Some of the issues with our feeling of \"busy\" may be cultural and not gender specific. \n\n## 42:19 - Transitioning to a New Team \n\n* Caitlyn's Engineer helped her understand that no one expected her to be completely plugged in for several weeks.  He worked to build her up. \n\n* Be open with others about being new and being a new parent.  Most are open to giving advice. \n\n* Caitlyn leveraged her teams to get up to speed and was extremely honest about what she knew.  She leveraged a lot of internal training to help. \n\n* The first week back was challenging.  She met a bunch of new customers and was trying to capture all of the important items. \n\n* Remember to pick a company that will embrace a little bit of change. \n\n* The week before Caitlyn came back to work, she wanted some \"me\" time.  She got a haircut, took some walks with the dog, etc.  She wanted to set her own schedule for a week to get acclimated to going back to work. \n\n* Do you have everything you need just to feel like yourself again? \n\n* Her Inbox was full of thousands of e-mails to go through. \n\n* She wanted to check in on how old projects turned out. \n\n* Lots of customers didn't know about the maternity leave and her transition to a new role. \n\n* It was weird but good. \n\n* How likely is Caitlyn to take more vacation in the future? \n\n* It's time to put up more walls and ask for coverage while she's away. \n\n* She and her husband have an unnatural tendency to want to help their customers, peers, and bosses. \n\n* Once per quarter they used to take a week to get downtime but eventually found themselves cheating and work. \n\n* Knowing the world will continue, taking a couple of days, and coming back with fresh eyes is something we all need. \n\n* You definitely have to take time out to reset and put your best self forward. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-113":{"title":"Episode 113","content":"\n# Episode 113\n\nWelcome to episode 113 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss a series of humbling experiences in part 1 of our interview with Brad Christian.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 03-16-2021 \n\nJohn has to step away for a few weeks to focus on house hunting.  The journey will continue, and he'll be back with us as soon as he can.  This reminded Nick of [Episode 68 - When Life Disrupts Your Work Life Balance](https://nerd-journey.com/when-life-disrupts-your-work-life-balance/). \n\nTopics – Early Career Journey, Leadership Potential, The Value of Practice, and the VCDX Journey [[Brad Christian]] #VCDX  #VMware \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:46 - The Career Journey \n\n* [Brad Christian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vhipster/) is a Solution Engineering Manager in the Networking and Security Business Unit at VMware. His team is responsible for products such as NSX, Avi Networks (software load balancer solution), and VeloCloud (SD-WAN). \n\n* Brad is from El Paso, TX.  He started building computers for gaming in college and fell into a job as a webmaster and really enjoyed the work. \n\n* After learning programming languages like Perl getting into Linux, he needed to get out of El Paso and moved to Dallas. \n\n* Brad slept on a cot in his brother's apartment for a month or so while job hunting. \n\n* He landed a job at a Marketing company around 2000 and was the only heterosexual in the company.  This taught him many lessons on how to get along with different types of people. \n\n* Brad learned a lot about not losing one's temper and slowing down to listen to others' points of view. \n\n* He got fired after later working at the Dallas Stars.  As part of a very thin team, he was short with users and greatly humbled by this experience. \n\n* Brad mentioned he would not be where he is today without that ego-crushing experience of getting fired. \n\n* It doesn't matter that you're smart if you're a jerk. \n\n* Brad was furious for weeks but eventually got over it, understanding the company did this for a reason. \n\n* What a company does affects the way they use people.  Brad worked every home game that season. \n\n* After this Brad did some contract work (short term projects) and eventually landed on a job at Dallas County. \n\n* Counties are much larger than cities from a datacenter perspective.  The county has the sheriff, court, judges, and the jail. \n\n* Listen as Brad shares an interesting story of employees at the jail finding a workaround to the web filter. \n\n* Brad worked here for about 4 years, and this is where he got exposure to SANs (storage area networks) and a large rack mount server farm (about 30 racks).  He learned a ton at this employer. \n\n* Brad had to learn how to work with #Consultants.  He initially did not think much of consultants. \n\n* Brad learned there was more to IT than working for a brick and mortar company. \n\n* Consultant is one thing, but a short term contractor did not give Brad a sense of ownership with what he was doing.  Being at Dallas County gave him that sense of ownership he wanted.     \n\n* Nick mentions the humbling aspect of working with consultants. \n\n* Brad learned how much he could learn from consultants and that he needed to just listen to what the consultants shared with him based on their experience. \n\n* John learned there are things he did not want to be an expert at, and having a consultant own that part of the project was something which allowed him to focus in other areas.  \n\n* Brad hit a decision point where he needed to choose between focusing on storage or moving toward virtualization with VMware, and he realized he needed to let go of storage to pursue something else.   \n\n* Brad shares a story about a datacenter flood toward the end of his career at Dallas County in the middle of summer. \n\n* People could not get out of jail because systems were down. \n\n* They had to bring systems up manually to let people out of prison on time for a month to avoid civil rights issues. \n\n* This taught Brad a TON about [[disaster recovery]], but the county would not approve a disaster recovery site and later had budget shortages. \n\n## 19:19 - A Glimmer of Leadership Potential and Learning VDI \n\n* Brad had started attending [VMware User Group (VMUG)](https://www.vmug.com/home) meetings in Dallas. #VMUG \n\n* He changed jobs and moved to CBRE (a great place to work). #CBRE\n\n* While Brad was at CBRE, the leader of the VMUG in Dallas stepped down (around 2010).  Brad found himself raising his hand to take over running the group, which was a huge learning experience. \n\n* Brad knew he needed to get better at public speaking, to be more calm and rational, and knew it would be a great way to network with other locals.   \n\n* CBRE was Brad's first chance to see a very large enterprise do things right at scale.   \n\n* No matter how good the IT department is, there is a cycle of creative destruction. \n\n* People will leave, and you have to go through a rebuilding phase. \n\n* There were over 2000 developers / contractors working on software (H1B Visa).  Instead of provisioning laptops, they decided to move to VDI (an early version of Horizon). \n\n* At first Brad didn't want to do it, but it turned out he was very good at it. \n\n* He thought the highest expression of skill in being an IT guy is VDI (so much skill involved).  Dealing with the users and keeping them happy takes a whole other level of skill. \n\n* Listen to Brad's story about a phone call after coming out of hip surgery to fix a VDI issue. \n\n* He knew at this point it was time to go. \n\n* Brad then worked for a company that made a product called Wallstreet Online. \n\n* They used a product called Lab Manager that was awesome.   \n\n## 25:05 - The Value of Practice \n\n* The job was too easy, too slow, and Brad went to work for a VAR (Value Added Reseller) called Sigma Solutions. \n\n* Here Brad finally learned how to master the art of administration.  It comes down to practice. \n\n* An aggregation of skills from previous jobs like bartending helped him excel in consulting. \n\n\t* Brad recommends reading a book called [Mastery](https://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/014312417X) by Robert Green.  It includes stories of people in history who became masters at what they do. [[Mastery]] [[Robert Greene]]\n\n* The book explains how these people became masters of what they do.  The value of practice really stuck with Brad. \n\n* It's great to figure things out and think quickly, but practice is important. \n\n* This tracks with other book recommendations we have mentioned like [The Talent Code](https://www.amazon.com/The-Talent-Code-Daniel-Coyle-audiobook/dp/B07VH2KNT2) and [Outliers](https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Malcolm-Gladwell-audiobook/dp/B001LNK9C4). [[The Talent Code]] [[Outliers]] [[Dan Coyle]] [[Malcom Gladwell]]\n\n* There is a huge different between the skill level of someone who worked their way up in IT and became a SE versus someone who went into being a SE straight out of school. \n\n* Brad encourages anyone straight out of school to take a break / fix job for 6 months to help your career and give you some experience. \n\n* John mentioned we lack the [[Apprentice, Journeyman, Master]] model in IT.  \n\n* The closest thing we have is #certifications, and that's not a great measure at times. \n\n* Employers have to take a chance on people that don't have the experience.   \n\n* Brad mentions not enough people talk about pay.  There was a law passed in 1935 to create the National Labor Relations Board. \n\n* You can discuss how much you make at your company with the people you work with. \n\n* We as Americans have been conditioned not to talk about how much we make, but that only helps your employer. \n\n* Talking about it with others gives you an idea how much to ask for when you ask for a raise. \n\n* John gives an example of something done at Google to allow employees to share how much they make so others can analyze it and get an idea of how they are doing, what is fair, etc. \n\n* See also [Glassdoor.com](Glassdoor.com).   \n\n* It's an American thing.  We're suckers.   \n\n* Brad mentioned fighting for raises when switching jobs. \n\n* Getting the [VCP or VMware Certified Professional](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vcp-dcv.html) was enough to bump his pay by about $20,000. \n\n* It's tough to choose a certification.  Getting a certification is only part of the story because you still need to be able to do the thing.   \n\n* Don't get too caught up in what is happening in tech right now (might be too late).  Think about what is happening in 3-5 years and build your network based on that. \n\n* This reminded Nick of Manny Sidhu's stance on choosing a certification or technology focus area.  Check out [Episode 80](https://nerd-journey.com/certification-and-mentoring-with-manny-sidhu/) to get the full story. \n\n* Nick shares his own certification story and how it was impacted by being at VMUG. \n\n## 39:58 - The VCDX Journey \n\n* While working at Sigma, Brad had met a number of VCDXs who were some of the smartest people he had ever met. \n\n* These folks were not only gifted technologists but also excellent communicators with a wide variety of platforms. \n\n* Brad wanted to get to that level of expertise.  It seemed like a mountain to climb to make himself get better. \n\n* Brad had to fly out to Palo Alto to defend his VCDX VDI design in front of Simon Long (someone he greatly admired). \n\n* Brad's wife was so relieved when he passed. \n\n* To prepare, Brad met some great people, sitting on conference calls a few nights each week for months to do mock defenses. \n\n* He learned humility throughout this process, finally discovering how much he did not know. \n\n* Brad always wanted to be the guy with the answers, but he found it is ok to say you don't know. \n\n* It took about 3.5 years between the decision to pursue the certification and passing.   \n\n* The first time Brad did a defense he failed.  He didn't understand the process, the rubric, or know anyone who had gone through it to point out his mistakes.  The rigor was not there. \n\n* He kept at it and continued learning enterprise architecture. \n\n* Enterprise Architecture is not discussed enough - opex and capex, design qualities, conceptual and logical design concepts, etc. \n\n* The VCDX design is hundreds of pages that includes a network and security design, user acceptance testing, etc. \n\n* Brad got better at his job by going through the process. \n\n* John adds to the point that Enterprise Architecture is not emphasized enough. \n\n* Brad mentions Enterprise Architecture is about managing complexity, which is not easy. Nothing is easy if you don't walk into it with your eyes open. \n\n* Look into [TOGAF](https://www.opengroup.org/togaf) for free certification resources that can help you be a better Enterprise Architect.  The test is $125. \n\n* This will make you learn the basics of Enterprise Architecture. \n\n* This is really about tying the tech back to the business.  Without that you aren't extremely valuable to anyone. \n\n* You have to be willing to accept change.  Many folks have a career that is a weighted blanket.  Be willing to get out of your comfort zone. \n\n* If you feel stupid a couple of times per day, you're learning. \n\n* Brad is hitting the Nerd Journey bingo spots. \n\n* Something else about certification to know… \n\n* There are people who work at VARs who hold certifications so the VAR gets a deeper discount with the manufacturer. \n\n* If you are a customer that users a VAR, make sure the person who shows up knows more than you do. \n\n* Watch out for \"paper tigers\" in any area. \n\n* John gives additional insight into these partner programs and the idea behind them. \n\n* There are bad actors in the process. \n\n* Using a manufacturer's professional services can be helpful, but it may come at a premium. \n\n* These folks to have had the practice. \n\n* What happened with the call from Sean Howard?  It will have to be something we cover next time! \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-114":{"title":"Episode 114","content":"\n# Episode 114\n\nWelcome to episode 114 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we discuss career tips from the manager lens in part 2 of our interview with Brad Christian.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 03-16-2021 \n\nTopics – Becoming a Manager, Managing Up, Safety Nets, and Finding Talent \n\n=========================== \n\n[Brad Christian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vhipster/) is a Solution Engineering Manager in the Networking and Security Business Unit at VMware.  Catch part 1 of our interview with him in [Episode 113](https://nerd-journey.com/a-series-of-humbling-experiences-with-brad-christian-1-2). [[Brad Christian]] #VMware [[Episode 113]]\n\n## 2:06 - Individual Contributor to Manager \n\n* Brad received a call from Sean Howard asking if he wanted to come work on NSX at VMware.  Brad found out he got the job and knew he could not continue running VMUG despite loving it. \n\n* He felt like he had been drafted for a pro sports team. \n\n* Brad got in and worked on a new product (NSX) and learned a ton. \n\n* It was like climbing a mountain.  You rest at the top and catch your breath a little. \n\n* Going to work for a manufacturer like VMware is not for everyone.  You have to enjoy working with people. \n\n* Brad understood he liked being in Sales and got energy from meeting with customers and more importantly solving their problems. \n\n* If meeting with people in this way takes energy away from you, this field is not for you. \n\n* There are many paths to pursue to get more money.  At the end of the day we are taking care of our families.  Brad ended up in leadership. \n\n* Brad would have laughed at someone who told him he should go into leadership 10 years ago. \n\n* In the Dallas County days he went through leadership training.   \n\n* He came to understand that with a team you can widen the impact and scope of what you can accomplish, especially with a high performance team. \n\n* At the county the biggest problem is people just being there for the paycheck. \n\n* Brad learns a great deal from his current team and considers himself a servant. \n\n* He and warns against being pushy or having the idea that you're going to be the \"big man.\"  Regardless of the company, no one is going to put up with that. \n\n* Brad's goal is to remove impediments from the team and help them do their job better.  If you can do that and enjoy it and hold onto your technical skills a little, you can be successful. \n\n* Cross over skills from the #VCDX? \n\n* Brad re-emphasizes the need to understand how the tech helps a business. \n\n* Right now Brad is trying to understand how SaaS and subscription affects revenue bookings.  It's a challenging problem compared to perpetual licenses. \n\n* You will still keep learning technical things, but enterprise architecture hammered into Brad that there must be a justification for everything to the business. \n\n* He could not have done VCDX without all the folks who helped with feedback on his design.  It was humility to take advice that directly translated to leadership. \n\n* John mentioned being a manager means you give up on being the best at everything.  The people interactions Brad had also helped. \n\n## 12:22 - Managing Up and Safety Nets \n\n* When you become a boss, it's not like you think it is. \n\n* When you are highly technical and high performing as an individual contributor, you are not being watched as carefully as you might think. \n\n* It's important to learn to manage up.  You can't just leave it up to your boss to get you a raise or pay bump.  Help him / her realize your worth. \n\n* Be able to draw attention to what you are doing.  If you don't sell yourself, no one else will. \n\n* Make sure people know what you're doing and update accomplishments on LinkedIn. \n\n* Brad struggles with getting his people to cheerlead for themselves.  He tells his team to make a folder and call it I Love Me.  Every time you get an e-mail complimenting you, save all of that to help you remember what you did successfully, and use it to help your managers. \n\n* Managers have to manage up as well.  Brad's management chain has been great to work with. \n\n* John mentioned there is a perception that documenting your work is just extra work, and people may not know how to do it well. \n\n* Brad recommends [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-David-Allen-audiobook/dp/B00005V7Q4) by [[David Allen]]. [[Getting Things Done]] \n\n* If you have not updated your resume in years, it is extremely stressful when applying for a new job.  Follow a system, and as part of it update the resume consistently. \n\n* Many people may not apply for a job because it's too much work. \n\n* When you finish a cool project, write it down and track it in some kind of system (like Evernote, for example).  Make this part of every Friday's routine.  Take screenshots, etc.  Save that stuff, and updating your resume is easy. \n\n* You need to be planning for your next job NOW! \n\n* You can't rely on a company as a safety net.  You're not going to get a watch in 20 years like it used to be. \n\n* Brad gives the example of his dad working for Eastman Kodak and getting laid off at one point.  He did not have a plan of what would be next. \n\n* Have an exit strategy, and be thinking about what is next on the ladder for you, even if not management. \n\n* Firing someone is incredibly hard to do.  Not everyone is meant to have that. \n\n* Don't think that the next step needs to be manager. \n\n* Consider the project manager role and other options in the industry. \n\n* It's not the company that will be your safety net but the people you develop relationships with over time. \n\n* Remember to also ask your network what you can be doing for them to keep the connections warm (i.e. don't make every contact you asking for something). \n\n* Constantly pay things forward.  Brad's current role was the genesis of raising his hand at that VMUG years ago. \n\n* Find ways to directly give back to others, the community, etc. \n\n* In-person training is Brad's biggest problem with COVID. The best thing you can do when the pandemic is over is to train in person. \n\n* Brad remembers getting energy from experiences with training and listening to people talk about their experience, share ideas, etc.   \n\n* He cites the NSX Ninja program as something extremely beneficial also. \n\n* Hearing the best in the world teach networking helped him finally get it. \n\n## 23:23 - Finding the Right Talent \n\n* Finding the right talent for his team was way harder than Brad anticipated. \n\n* He had been a leader before but did not have control over who got hired (seemed to happen at a level higher than him).  Normally he was the technical interviewer. \n\n* If someone does not know the tech, Brad doesn't really care.  If they have experience as a customer and can share that experience, it will be helpful in the role. \n\n* Brad has managed SEs who specialized in Networking and Security as well as HCI (i.e. vSAN, Cloud Foundation). \n\n* As soon as someone gets into a role like this, there is a ton of training. \n\n* There are things which cannot be taught - getting along with others, for example. \n\n* One test is to ask yourself if you would want to be in a car with the person for 3 hours. \n\n* Diversity and inclusion is hard as well.   \n\n* Finding female engineers is challenging, and the process has to be different. \n\n* Guys will lie about their accomplishments and exaggerate skills, while ladies won't do that. \n\n* Some may see a list of requirements in a job description and decide not to apply based on them.    \n\n* There are way too many dudes in our industry. \n\n* John mentioned it is now more culturally acceptable for women to be nerds. \n\n* Sometimes you have to dig for the nerds.  Brad likes to ask what people nerd out on in their spare time.  He reads a great deal in his spare time. \n\n* Dig for what people are passionate about in the interview, and learn about what makes them a good fit for the role. \n\n* Brad wants to help the person in the interview relax and feel at ease.  And in his conversations with people he is trying to sell them on the role. \n\n* A good manager will stay in touch with people who made it deep in the process but did not get the role. \n\n* Little things like sending a thank you note are helpful.  Connect with the hiring manager on LinkedIn. \n\n* Not getting a job in one instance doesn't mean you are out of the running forever. \n\n* At VMware there are panel interviews.  The process goes like this - discussion with HR, discussion with the manager, and then the panel process. \n\n* Remote interviews are a challenge and require a presentation.  Brad encourages presenters to choose a topic other than the technology. \n\n* How do you mitigate risk in hires? \n\n* Some of this is tied to the segment where you work (in Sales, at least).  Each has a unique challenge.  Brad is in the commercial segment (the mid-market). \n\n* Maybe you are new, inexperienced, and want to make the jump.  If you have the experience it may take you a while to train to standards, but as long as you have the social skills and are a nice person, Brad will take that chance. \n\n* Try different companies, different segments, and look at Value Added Resellers. \n\n* Brad learned a ton about how the business works from someone at Sigma. \n\n* The real risk is managing customer outages. \n\n* Work at all different sizes of companies to gain experience. \n\n* Don't give up after one try. \n\n* Brad says he has a hard time finding people to hire.  Not enough people will apply, and many may self-select out of the process due to lack of confidence. \n\n* Brad gives the example of a recent hire he made where the person was not an expert at NSX and gives an example of his employee's expertise in other areas of the VMware portfolio. \n\n* Brad explains why he took a chance on this particular person. \n\n* Don't send more than 1 page on a resume. \n\n* Brad shares what he looks for on resumes during the hiring process. \n\n* Job hopping does not look good. \n\n* There are so many resumes that there is little time to spend too much time on each one. \n\n* Keep in mind HR filters resumes based on key words.  You need to get through that to get to a hiring manager. \n\n* Make sure the resume says who you are and what makes you stand out. \n\n* Show enthusiasm about the job if you talk to the hiring manager.  The hiring manager is a human who wants you to be excited about the company. \n\n* Ask questions during the interview! \n\n* If you show you are worried about the culture, you are most likely a fit. \n\n* There are genuinely nice people at companies. \n\n* Ask questions about who your teammates will be. \n\n* One of the hardest things for leaders right now is building a high performing team when no one gets together in person. \n\n* Brad is managing a team of people who for the most part have never met each other and expecting them to be a cohesive team. \n\n* Don’t hesitate to bring your experience on teams in the past (sports, military, etc.)? \n\n## 40:52 - Parting Thoughts \n\n* Don't be afraid to dream big. \n\n* Brad plans to go back and teach (PhD in History) after finishing his career. \n\n* Really Brad has enjoyed the teaching aspect of all of his roles.  He mentioned it took a long time to figure out his life's task.  There are tips for helping you figure this out in the book [Mastery](https://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene-audiobook/dp/B00A6G9CGG). [[Mastery]] [[Robert Greene]]\n\n* He enjoys building others up, teaching them, and giving them the chance to advance and make more money.  \n\n* It will be something else for you.  Figure out what that thing is and what the next steps will be to get there. \n\n* Find systems and networks to get you there. \n\n* Don't be someone who does break / fix for 25 years.   \n\n* Find out what your life's task is and work toward it. \n\n* Brad went for the #VCDX even though he was cautious at first, but it got him to where he wanted to go.  \n\n* Listen to podcasts, go to user groups, and rely on the people around you to get to that next level. \n\n## After the Recording Stopped… \n\n* Nick and Brad had an interesting discussion about fitness and stress relief.  Brad wanted to emphasize the role physical fitness played in stress reduction for him.   \n\n* Recommended reads on this from Brad are \n\n* [Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-Mark-Rippetoe-audiobook/dp/B07V218KGK) by [[Mark Rippetoe]] [[Starting Strength]] \n\n* [Iron and the Soul](https://www.oldtimestrongman.com/articles/the-iron-by-henry-rollins/) blog post by Henry Rollins \n\n* It would be good to follow up with Brad on these items at some point in the future! \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-115":{"title":"Episode 115","content":"\n# Episode 115\n\nWelcome to episode 115 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Jeff Eberhard, discussing his path to management, team career progression, and what makes a good manager.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-01-2021 \n\n## Topics – Early Career Path, Motivations and the Move to Management, Characteristics of a Good Manager, Career Conversations, New Talent, Academy Team \n\nOur guest this week is [Jeff Eberhard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyeberhard/), a Sales and Solution Engineering Leader at Oracle focused on Oracle Cloud VMware Solution.  Contrast what we hear from Jeff's path with that of Brad Christian in [Episode 113](https://nerd-journey.com/a-series-of-humbling-experiences-with-brad-christian-1-2/)  and [Episode 114](https://nerd-journey.com/career-insight-from-the-manager-lens-with-brad-christian-2-2/).  [[Jeff Eberhard]] [[Brad Christian]] #Oracle [[Episode 113]] [[Episode 114]]\n\n## 2:30 - Recounting the Career Path \n\n* Jeff resides in Austin, Texas with his family.  He grew up in California and moved to Austin after college.   \n\n* Jeff's first job out of school was with a ticket resale company doing Systems Administration.   \n\n* The back end systems comprised of hundreds of hosts that purchased tickets from Ticketmaster. \n\n* He racked and stacked servers, worked with proxies, and did some scripting. \n\n* Jeff decided to move to a slightly different field with a longer career path. \n\n* He started working for Dell selling personal computer equipment. \n\n* Jeff's peers in the Enterprise group were selling servers, storage, and networking. Jeff decided to go and learn how to do it as well. \n\n* He eventually moved to HP and sold servers and storage to customers in the UK and Ireland. \n\n* After HP, Jeff got a job at VMware after many tries.  He had originally tried to apply for a role as a sales rep, but when he got the job it was for a Solution Engineer position. \n\n* A Solution Engineer talks to people in technology and explains what VMware technologies do. \n\n* After about a year, Jeff moved into leadership, starting a team that supported small to medium businesses. \n\n* Over the course of 9 years he worked in a variety of segments, including Enterprise, and then moved into a management role related to VMware Cloud on AWS. \n\n* This experience allowed Jeff to understand and work with people at AWS via the partnership between VMware and AWS on this solution (learning all the good and the bad that comes with this).   \n\n* This translated well into Jeff's current role as a leader at Oracle, where he has been for about 8 months. \n\n## 07:07 - Understanding Motivations and the Move to Management \n\n* What made Jeff go into full sales? \n\n* It was the hours and the money.  Jeff had an interesting schedule at the ticket resale company, having to start at 6-8 AM  to ensure servers were up and running during times of special sales.  It was low paying at $12 / hour and required working overnight shifts. \n\n* He had some friends who had started at Dell working the day shift and making more money. \n\n* He loved the technology was getting well versed at scripting.  \"But when you are 21 and want money, you go where it is.\"  - Jeff Eberhard \n\n* Jeff had no hesitations about stepping away from the keyboard.  His interests are in technology, but he prefers understanding the technology, what is cool about it, and then moving on. \n\n* This is likely why a move into leadership made sense for Jeff.  As a leader he needs to be more than just the suit in the corner, and he does not want to be someone who plays in a lab or fiddles with the technology all day. \n\n* He got to chase down a passion of talking about technology and understanding it at a 200 level rather than having to go super deep. \n\n* What made management interesting to Jeff? \n\n* First, Jeff was on a very strong team of Solution Engineers at VMware, most of them very well experienced. \n\n* When Jeff first started in Solution Engineering, it was very new to him.  He had been in Sales for 10 years previous to this. \n\n* The team was far more technical than Jeff, but he had a lot more success than many of his peers. \n\n* After 9 months in the role, Jeff went to his boss and asked to be considered to lead a new team that was forming but was told no.  The boss did not feel the team would take him seriously after 9 months in the role. \n\n* After this conversation, Jeff called his peers and asked their opinion of him being their future boss.  The answer was a resounding \"that's a good idea.\"  They were open to learning from him as a leader. \n\n* If Jeff could help improve the team but learn from them at the same time, it was an ideal scenario. \n\n* This prompted Jeff to go back to his boss and mention he had his peers' support.  After being put through the formal process, he got the job. \n\n* Jeff knew the move would be beneficial to himself and the team he would be leading.  He knew he would never be as technical as those he would manage. \n\n* Asking your boss to go into leadership depends on the leader and your relationship with that person.  \n\n* Jeff has had many of his team members express a desire to go into leadership, and his goal is to try and help the person get there. \n\n* If someone has the drive and desire to move into leadership it makes your job as their manager easier. \n\n* Consider giving the person some managerial tasks to complete so they can dip a toe into what it's really like. \n\n* In your career if you do not take chances and ask for things, you are not going to get the things you want. \n\n* Jeff had to learn how to manage people significantly older than him. \n\n*How do I lead someone who has been doing this since before I was born? \n\n* If you get the opportunity to try it, you will learn what works and what does not work quickly. \n\n* In general, Jeff feels that people have not had issues with having a younger manager…as long as they felt he was competent. \n\n* Jeff has been able to use positive peer pressure to help influence  members of his team he might have trouble influencing initially.   \n\n* A manager may suggest a methodology the employee tried years ago that did not work.  The question is…will they be open to trying it again since time has passed? \n\n* Most external candidates come in knowing technology companies like Oracle and VMware are hard to get into, especially leadership positions. \n\n* Where Jeff ran into some minor challenges was mostly with internal moves. \n\n* Experience is not just a function of time.   \n\n* Jeff's current boss has moved up quickly in the business and has very good business sense. \n\n* Jeff sees that his boss has been able to accomplish many things and is looking to try and emulate that level of success. \n\n## 22:26 - A Good Manager \n\n* Jeff has liked having managers who are interested in a personal connection. \n\n* Before COVID, Jeff would spend more time with co-workers than his own family. \n\n* A boss can have more of an impact on your life than probably anyone except your significant other.  Much of our work livelihood relies on our boss. \n\n* A good boss will take the time to get to know you on a personal level - likes, dislikes, etc. \n\n* Good bosses should send presents to their people. It shows they care as does remembering birthdays. \n\n* Good bosses recognize people have their own skills…some very useful and some that need work. \n\n* Help people working for you by strengthening the good things while helping to improve the weak spots. \n\n* It is important for the boss to have a good grasp on the business. \n\n* In the end, from senior leadership's perspective, they are not necessarily looking at what the front line employees are doing but see employees as a member of the boss's team.   \n\n* If the boss is not thought of as competent, knowledgeable, etc. leadership will have a similar perspective of the entire team. \n\n* Career Conversations \n\n* Some people are happy where they are.  If you hit an employee that is a solid A- player and extremely happy in that spot, this should be ok. \n\n* These folks may not want to take on a next position with extra travel or other requirements and may not even be interested in a big raise. \n\n* Probably 1/3 to 1/4 of a team falls into this category of solid players. \n\n* The next group is high flyers / those who expect to be high flyers with excellent work ethics. \n\n* Jeff's goal with this group is to put them in a spot where they can showcase their work to the rest of the organization. \n\n* Listen to an example of someone on Jeff's team who is a high flyer that had no interest in leadership. \n\n* This person wanted to remain technical. \n\n* Another quarter of the team will struggle a little. \n\n* Are they comfortable being seen as a B or C player on an all A team? \n\n* Some may be fine with it.  Others will be willing to work to improve.  Perhaps it makes sense to find the person a role that allows them to bring more passion.  \n\n* Don't sit somewhere for 20 to 30 more years where you're not really into it. \n\n* Maybe the person needs a shift in role or responsibilities to generate some excitement. \n\n* Then there are the new people. \n\n* They come in with excitement, and some want to have a career conversation immediately, seeking to get promoted right away. \n\n* Listen to how Jeff helps these folks understand where they are without completely deflating and discouraging them. \n\n* The key thing is to hook these folks up with a mentor of someone in the solid players group.  The solid players are content and won't be threatened by the newcomers, even if new team members eventually reach higher than them at some point.  They will mentor like crazy. \n\n* It may be hard to get the high flyers to mentor. \n\n* If the only real path forward is management and you don't think you want it, don't do it. \n\n* If people management is not something you enjoy, see if they can create a next level individual contributor role for you, or find an organization where it exists. \n\n* Jeff has seen highly technical people get promoted and continue to be the technical expert without truly relying on the team and allowing them to shine. \n\n* The individual contributor path upward may be through taking on a project or a product instead of a team. \n\n* At small organizations the only way to move up may be to move on. \n\n* A move, even after a number of years at the same place, can energize you. \n\n* Every time Jeff took a new job within the same company or at a different company, it energized him. \n\n* There is something good and something bad about having no idea what you are doing for the first 6 months. \n\n* Jeff recounts not knowing very many people even when making the internal transfer over to the VMware Cloud on AWS team within VMware. \n\n* That six months is a little stressful but can produce a new high of energy. \n\n* How do you focus on your own career as a manager? \n\n* It's easier to criticize someone else than yourself.  When you point out things others need to work on to get better, you start to reflecting on yourself also. \n\n* Jeff mentions a team member of his that needed better time management eventually teaching him a better system to use. \n\n* Look outside your organization within the company. \n\n* A manager needs contacts in other business units to help employees make a move over to those organizations.  Jeff gives an example of building connections that helped him get a different job. \n\n## 40:58 - Building The Academy Team \n\n* Many technology companies are trying to \"build their own.\"  They go after college juniors and seniors for intern-like programs. \n\n* They go pick very lucky, very intelligent recent college graduates to get trained on technology, how to sell, how to demo, how to be technical, etc. \n\n* Jeff was responsible for the Solution Engineering Academy at VMware, which was extremely fun. \n\n* These folks know they are special and know they are coming in to learn.  They understand it is a great opportunity to get a career head start. \n\n* You love the passion these folks have because it builds the team up. \n\n* Everyone starts off jealous. \n\n* The Academy members come in and are so excited people just want to help them. \n\n* Some of the best interviews Jeff has conducted has been with candidates coming into the Academy program.  They have the passion and the excitement. \n\n* It may take some time for the new employees to be effective (i.e. need training), it raises everyone's level on the team. \n\n* Having this new energy on the team can even get the B / C players fired up and motivated. \n\n* From a business perspective, having an Academy program supports diversity and inclusion (a big issue in technology). \n\n* You're hiring based on schooling, passion, and excitement and not based on an existing pool of candidates that may not be diverse. \n\n* Jeff gives the example of an Academy team class with 7 women and 1 man on it, the opposite of what we might normally see on a Solution Engineering team.   \n\n* The dynamic of this team was completely different than other teams Jeff managed at the time (one with 13 men and 2 women, for example). \n\n* All of the women on the Academy team mentioned have been promoted and are doing really well. \n\n* Many of the folks Jeff has hired as part of the Academy program came through Industrial Engineering, which has a lot to do with process improvement. \n\n* Jeff gives a great example of some of the responses people had in interviews with the Industrial Engineering background. \n\n* Initially, the Academy team recruiters started looking at Computer Science majors.  These people like to code, but Jeff and team figured out they needed people who could present and talk and had interests in making customer's lives better. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-116":{"title":"Episode 116","content":"\n# Episode 116\n\nWelcome to episode 116 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

An Opportunity Arises \n\n* Nick asks to dig into a talk Jeff gave back in February at the [Dallas / Fort Worth SpiceCorps meeting](https://community.spiceworks.com/meeting/show/3243).  #Spiceworks \n\n* What were Jeff's motivations for making a change even when he originally did not think it was needed? \n\n* Jeff was a huge fan of a former boss at VMware, and his goal was to eventually take his boss' job when he retired.   \n\n* While still working as part of the VMware Cloud on AWS team, he was asked to come back to the organization in the company where he had previously managed a team before making that move (and was able to be under a boss that he loved). \n\n* Things were going well for Jeff, and then he received a LinkedIn message from someone at Oracle asking if he wanted to learn about what VMware and Oracle were doing together. \n\n* Jeff said no, but the person was persistent and asked Jeff to take a 15-minute phone call.` \n\n* Jeff felt there was no harm in taking the call to understand what Oracle was doing.  It might even help him to know it in his current role at VMware. \n\n* The job sounded like what Jeff wanted to have after his current boss was to retire. \n\n* After having the conversation with the person from Oracle, Jeff called his boss and spoke to him about it. \n\n* Caution - having a personal relationship with your boss is important in this situation.  Many may fear being fired for telling your boss something like this.  This is not recommended unless you know you are in a good spot. \n\n* Jeff's boss encouraged him to stick it out for a while in his current role. \n\n* Jeff decided to go through the interview process, which was completely over Zoom. \n\n* As the process continued, he got more and more excited about the opportunity and the team. \n\n* At the end of the process, Jeff received an offer (a very good one). \n\n* He had been keeping his boss updated on the process. \n\n* A boss generally knows how much they can offer an employee to stay.  Jeff was pretty certain his boss could not match or exceed the offer made to him (and he was right). \n\n* This was an opportunity to build a business and a team around it, taking on something well outside his comfort zone. \n\n* The team Jeff was running at VMware was comprised of very smart people who didn't need him as much as a new team might. \n\n* Jeff feels like his boss understood his need to continue the process and eventually take the new job with Oracle despite earlier encouragement to stick it out.  Jeff felt like his boss truly wanted what was going to be best for him in the long run. \n\n## 9:00 - Negotiating to Stay or Leave \n\n* When employees leave \n\n* Jeff shares a story of an Academy team member who got a job elsewhere.  He knew it better fit what she wanted. \n\n* His goal is never to trap someone. \n\n* He's also had conversations with the high flyers on his team who shared that they were interviewing elsewhere.  In those cases, he will provide advice and help so the employee can get the new job. \n\n* Jeff shares some stories from his experience. \n\n* If the new job is offered to the person with a different company, Jeff is happy for that person and now has a friend at another company. \n\n* If the employee gets an offer and shows it to him, he can try to get the employee more money to stay.  If he can compensate someone better and have a happy employee, all the better. \n\n* Jeff also shares situations where people he can't afford to lose plan to leave. \n\n* What about when employees who were going to leave end up staying? \n\n* If you have a good relationship with your boss and it is open like Jeff mentioned, there will be no target on your back.  It's a business negotiation. \n\n* When it's completely out of left field, it can sound spiteful and that you're saying you will go do something if you don't get what you want. \n\n* In this case, go take the other job.  Listen to the inside scoop from Jeff on how a manager can be made to look very bad if an employee leaving comes out of the blue and they have to ask to get you more money. \n\n## 13:52 - Plunging into #Oracle \n\n* Jeff's wife has been with Oracle for a number of years. \n\n* The company is divided into two sides of the business, one managed by Larry Ellison that his wife works under, and one managed by someone else whom Jeff works under. \n\n* Other than his wife, Jeff didn't know anyone who works for Oracle. \n\n* The relationship between Oracle and VMware has traditionally not been great.  \n\n* Jeff knew who to go to at VMware for things after being there for many years, but at Oracle he would need to learn the organization. \n\n* He was provided a Sherpa at Oracle (someone who is now a manager of a team in Jeff's organization) who was invested in his success and would help him learn the organization and make contacts within the company.  Jeff's boss has also provided helpful  guidance and support. \n\n* Jeff's stress level was high when he first started but has decreased significantly through the support he's received from his management chain and reports. \n\n*  Jeff is about to move from 17 direct reports to 4.  This change will allow him to focus on strategy rather than the day-to-day tactical issues. \n\n* There is some fear when you go from being in charge of something to someone else being in charge of it and you are just getting reports on it. \n\n* You have to learn to delegate and rely on others.  Jeff read a good CIO.com article called [Delegation IS Leadership Development](Delegation IS leadership development) on this topic.   \n\n* Giving employees the chance to own a project or a task helps everyone.   \n\n* The first one may not be what you wanted or may turn out different than you wanted.  But it creates a chance to have a conversation about it to understand how things were done or if you set incorrect expectations as a manager. \n\n* The managers under Jeff can do much of the daily tasks that Jeff was doing so he can focus in other areas.  His job now is to teach the managers how to pass along what was great about them as individual contributors to their direct reports. \n\n* This allows bidirectional growth for these managers and for Jeff (so he can learn from them). \n\n## 21:40 - Team Details \n\n* When Jeff joined the company, he had 8 folks working for him.  The team is about to be 26 people. \n\n* This spans the globe - India, Europe, North America, etc. (across many time zones). \n\n* The hardest thing is that most folks have never met each other in person.   \n\n* Jeff has managed remote teams in the past, and they would usually get together a couple of times per quarter with some baked in team building activities. \n\n* Listen to Jeff's story about the Slack channel he created to promote team interaction. \n\n* Team cohesion would likely be better if they could meet in person, but they are doing their best. \n\n* Teams are geographically disperse, have not met each other in person, and are new to the company makes for a unique challenge for onboarding new employees. \n\n* Reach out to Jeff if you have ideas on how to promote engagement! \n\n* Many people are changing jobs right now.  How do we bring people on and get them excited about working for a new company? \n\n* A best practice for interviewing from both the hiring manager and employee perspective, an in-person interview is ideal. \n\n* Everyone Jeff has hired at Oracle had remote hiring processes. \n\n* At VMware it was probably 50/50.  It did not always make sense for the candidate to travel to Austin to interview with Jeff or for him to travel to their location. \n\n* If you can, rely on referrals and others who know the candidate.  A boss may not care about meeting the person outside of a video call if the referral comes from a trusted source. \n\n* What is Jeff's process like for hiring? \n\n* Jeff usually does all of the first screens. \n\n* Then 3 members of the team will interview the candidate. \n\n* The final interview is a bar raiser.  \n\n* This is someone who is not part of Jeff's organization that looks for whether the person will make the company better and the longevity of the person's career at Oracle (i.e. make sure that person would have a job if Jeff's team's function went away). \n\n* Jeff likes doing a customer scenario and will look at a candidate's ability to think and adapt quickly. \n\n* Getting told no may mean the manager had your best interest at heart. \n\n* The goal is to never hire someone that won't work out. \n\n* Jeff likes to be honest with candidates by giving feedback quickly.  It's important to give that honest feedback to someone, even if it is in the interview or right after it. \n\n* Go back and listen to [[Keiran Shelden]]'s story about feedback after an interview in [Episode 46](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-046-career-advancement-keiran-shelden-pt-1/). [[Episode 46]]\n\n## 33:25 - Parting Thoughts \n\n* If looking to change jobs during the pandemic run toward something super exciting and not away from a current situation.  It's hard enough to get a job normally but has been more challenging for many during the pandemic. \n\n* If you are looking to get into leadership, say it early.  With the manager Jeff recently hired, he brought up his desire to go into leadership in the first conversation he and Jeff had. \n\n* This makes you top of mind when an opportunity comes up that is interesting. \n\n* Jeff shares how he was able to stair step this candidate into leadership. \n\n* The first time your boss hears about your interest should not be when a requisition opens.  \n\n* For external candidates looking for manager roles, ask in the first screening call if you are going up against a bunch of internal people.  Be prepped for it and understand the situation as it could be way harder up against internal candidates. \n\n* Reach out to Jeff on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyeberhard). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.022588765Z","tags":null},"/Episode-117":{"title":"Episode 117","content":"\n# Episode 117\n\nWelcome to episode 117 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Kate Emshoff and discuss Kate's early career, challenges around relocation for work, and some interview subtleties for women.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-06-2021 \n\nTopics – Early Career History, Relocation, Job Changes, and Interview Subtleties \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:32 - Meet Kate Emshoff \n\n* [Kate Emshoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kateemshoff/) is a mother of 3 living in the Chicago suburbs and works for [Innovatis Group](https://innovatisgroup.com/).  One of the largest clients is [VMware User Group (VMUG)](https://www.vmug.com/about-vmug/what-is-vmug) where Kate serves as the Senior Director of Program Management and Operations. [[Kate Emshoff]] #Innovatis #VMUG \n\n* Kate started on March 9, 2020 (which was about the time everything shut down because of the pandemic). \n\n* Her focus is more on execution of programs like [UserCons](https://www.vmug.com/events2/vmug-usercon), and she has never attended a UserCon in person.  All of these are virtual at present. \n\n* Going into the pandemic, VMUG already a fairly robust virtual event platform, so it was not too difficult to change everything to virtual events. \n\n* VMUG hopes to begin having some in-person events in September of 2021. \n\n## 5:11 - Early Career History \n\n* Kate attended Illinois State University studying communications and then focused on public relations and business administration. \n\n* Upon graduation she wasn't extremely clear about what she wanted to do. \n\n* But, she had the chance to study abroad in Salzburg, Austria and visit a number of countries in Europe. \n\n* Kate had to take out a loan to take the trip, but it was worth it, and the experience helped her realize she wanted to work in international business. \n\n* One of her first jobs was working for the Radiological Association of North America (RSNA). \n\n* The Marketing position where she started was more of an admin role. \n\n* Interestingly enough, every position Kate has taken in her career has been a role that previously did not exist at the company. \n\n* Kate was charged with marketing the company's scholarly journals to institutions like libraries and hospitals (where RSNA had been targeting individuals only). \n\n* This included negotiating licensing with universities and healthcare systems internally.  Every country has a different healthcare system. \n\n* Navigating these new waters for the company helped Kate elevate quickly.  She became a manager at a young age and was horrible at it. \n\n* As you elevate to management it's less about executing and more about being more intentional about growing, encouraging, coaching, and mentoring. \n\n* At one point she wanted to leave Chicago (had never lived anywhere else). \n\n* She accepted a job at The Royal Society in London after flying out there to interview, but it ended up not working out. \n\n* This was after she had given up her apartment lease and sold all her furniture! \n\n* She still wanted to live somewhere else and interview with a company that published content online. \n\n* After interviewing with one company, she called a friend who told her about a new opportunity in Marketing at his company (Silverchair). \n\n* Working for Silverchair was like working at a 20-year old startup, but it also prompted a move to Charlottesville, VA. \n\n* Kate met her future husband right before moving. \n\n* They maintained a long-distance relationship. \n\n* Charlottesville was a cool university town and a good experience.   \n\n* During this time Kate was able to get into the STEM field and worked with scientific, technical, and medical publishers. \n\n## 13:30 - Fitting into a New Group of Peers \n\n* Kate had the Marketing and PR background and worked with people who were editors by trade.  She was a bit of an outlier at the time. \n\n* Sometimes in your career you may lean toward places that make you feel comfortable, but it's important to embrace somewhere where you are uncomfortable or don't fit in with everyone else.  It can make you stand out. \n\n* The people Kate worked with loved talking about what they had learned and what they did in their field.     \n\n* You have to be ok with being vulnerable and asking questions of others, but it can't always be peppering them with questions. \n\n* Kate considers many of the people she worked with lifelong friends despite their differences from her. \n\n* Listen to Kate's story of being a young woman in her field and her willingness to point out arrogance in the Sales teams she worked with who wanted to sell to nonprofits. \n\n* She was willing to speak up when others might not have, and her co-workers took the feedback. \n\n* Nick stressed the importance of giving difficult feedback. He cited [Thanks for the Feedback](https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Feedback-Science-Receiving-Well/dp/0143127136) as mentioning sometimes the people who disagree with us the most may have the best feedback for us. [[Thanks for the Feedback]]\n\n* Sometimes people might not know they are acting or presenting themselves in a certain way. \n\n## 19:58 - Back to RSNA and a Desire for More \n\n* Kate was working from home in Chicago and not loving it.  She is an extrovert by nature. \n\n* The Executive Director at RSNA (a former employer) wanted her to have lunch to discuss a new department focused on International Affairs. \n\n* She had done licensing negotiations with people in other parts of the world, which really does require learning different cultures. \n\n* She would be starting from scratch, build a team, and create a committee to get this department off the ground. \n\n* Kate stayed there for 7 years. \n\n* During this time she got married and had 3 kids. \n\n* At some point she got bored and started looking for a new job.  She interviewed for a job while 9 months pregnant. \n\n* Many people in her life questioned what she was doing looking for a new job with small children.  She regrets listening to them. \n\n* You're going to be away from your family to some extent, so find something that interests you.  \n\n* There are not many examples of women with small children that are looking for a career change.  It’s like we have a societal norm that says it's not ok. \n\n* Many working women might say if they could work at McDonald's and make the same money, they would do it.  This is not the case for Kate.  It should be ok to say you want to pursue a career even if you have small children. \n\n* She tried to stick around at RSNA, but it came clear she needed more. \n\n## 24:16 - Subtleties for Women in Interviewing \n\n* There are things people might not realize are different for women when doing virtual interviews.  Kate received some advice from other women to do the following: \n\n* Removing pictures of children \n\n* Taking off your engagement ring so people don't perceive wealth and decide to pay you less \n\n* It is likely men and women alike might not know they are judging someone on these things. \n\n* There are some subtleties present even on virtual conference calls (i.e. Zoom or other). \n\n* Kate had to remind her husband to be mindful of giving the women on his calls an opportunity to talk.   \n\n* He dismissed it at first and then came back to Kate days later agreeing that this really is a problem.  Her husband said people were talking over the women constantly. \n\n* Maybe this stems from talking with those we feel comfortable with, and it's easy to forget you need to include someone else. \n\n* It's important to be able to have open discussions where we admit our blind spots and try to learn together.  It's how we encourage change, but it's hard to have them and makes us uncomfortable. \n\n* Even after reading [Fierce Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Fierce-Conversations-Achieving-Success-Conversation/dp/0425193373) and [Crucial Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/0071771328), these situations can still be challenging.  We have to practice. [[Fierce Conversations]] [[Crucial Conversations]]\n\n* Most of the initial interviews Kate attended as part of her move to Innovatis Group were virtual.  There were some in person interviews taking place at that time, but this was February / March 2020. \n\n* Kate was asked about her family in interviews. \n\n* She took HR training while at RSNA and learned what you can and cannot ask during interviews.  Asking whether someone has kids is generally a getting to know you kind of question. \n\n* She lived in the suburbs of Chicago at the time but wanted a job in the city.  Interviewers asked her if she would be ok with the commute. \n\n* Kate was also trying to get away from so much international travel and felt a little judgement from interviewers when they found out she had small children. \n\n* When Kate interviewed for her role at Innovatis, she was told she would fit right in as many of the women she would work with had a baby within the previous year to Kate coming aboard. \n\n* Does telling a potential employer about having small children lead them to automatically believe the potential employee will need extreme flexibility? \n\n* Kate points out a bias she has seen from male interviewers that have learned about her having small children.  Does this influence a decision between two strong candidates? \n\n* Perhaps an employer might not feel they will get the most from their investment if the candidate is a mother of small children (Nick's opinion). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-118":{"title":"Episode 118","content":"\n# Episode 118\n\nWelcome to episode 118 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Kate Emshoff and discuss aspects of motherhood and career along with interview considerations and women in technology.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-06-2021 \n\nTopics – Mother as Part of the Woman, Advice for the Career-Minded Mom, Interview Approaches, Women in Technology [[Kate Emshoff]] \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:17 - Mother as Part of the Woman \n\n* Kate's mother-in-law was a stay at home mom. \n\n* Kate's husband has always supported her pursuing a career. \n\n* Even on days she feels overwhelmed, her husband reminds her that she would be otherwise unhappy and lose her mind if she wasn't pursuing a career. \n\n* He knows her well enough to understand she needs to be in a career she loves and enjoys. \n\n* If she was not, she would feel unfulfilled. \n\n* Listen to Kate's story about being able to give her husband the freedom to take risks and make big moves.   \n\n* Does it offend a mother of young children if you say \"I could never do that, have a career and be a mother / parent of small children?\" \n\n* Yes. People may not understand it is extremely hard for a mother of small children to go to another country and be away from them. \n\n* Traveling to other countries made Kate more appreciative of her country and appreciative of how big our world is.  She loved being able to give her kids the perspective of different cultures and countries. \n\n* Listen to her story of having to make a trip to Vienna with less than 24 hours notice, being 12 weeks pregnant, and feeling sick the whole time. \n\n* This type of feedback from others can make you question your sanity. \n\n* Does being away from family like this help you be more present when you are with them? \n\n* Kate knows she and her family have a system that works for them.  She is thankful her kids are with people who care when she is away. \n\n* She sees mother as a part of her but not the entirety of her. \n\n* Being a mother should not be something we use to define a woman's capabilities. \n\n* Kate's boss at the time of all of her international travel (though a woman) did not have children and couldn't understand why Kate wanted to take a full 12 weeks of leave to have a baby. \n\n* Her boss eventually had a baby and finally understood the struggles associated with leaving the country and needing to worry about all business travel related items as well as caring for small children.  She and Kate were about to support each other. \n\n* No one Kate knew was doing anything similar to what she was with the international travel. \n\n* Kate's friends said things like \"I will travel when my kids are grown\" or \"now is not the time for me to travel.\" \n\n* Nick mentioned [Caitlyn Bryan's story](https://nerd-journey.com/pregnancy-during-a-technical-career-with-caitlyn-bryan-2-2/) of taking extended maternity leave after initially not knowing if she would take the full time. [[Caitlyn Bryan]]\n\n* Kate references a documentary called [Zero Weeks](https://www.zeroweeks.com/) about the US and maternity leave. [[Zero Weeks]]\n\n* Kate had spoken with the producer of this film about being filmed at the office, but it never came to fruition. \n\n## 13:50 - Advice for the [[Career-Minded Mom]] \n\n* Trust yourself, and listen to your gut.  The rules someone else has made don't necessarily apply for you. \n\n* You can have it all if you find the right company. \n\n* Look at the turnover ratios and the number of women in leadership (very important to Kate). \n\n* Have a strong support network. \n\n* It is a little lonely out there with not many like minded women out there who really want to pursue a career while having small children. \n\n* Kate might not feel comfortable asking a company what the policy for maternity leave is how they treat women. \n\n* Pay attention in interviews for subtle details about a work / life imbalance (i.e. working late, sending e-mails late, etc.). \n\n* Listen when people talk about their bosses, and make sure someone alludes to a woman in leadership.  That is very important. \n\n* Ask the HR screener about benefits packages, etc. \n\n* Once you have an offer, you can ask more of the HR questions. \n\n* Listen to Kate's story about asking if a company had a formal HR department and the interviewer's reaction. \n\n* It can be tricky during the interview process to determine what the culture is really like. \n\n* In Kate's last job search, she submitted her resume but also networked with others.  She prioritized things like an organization of interesting thinkers where she would often feel like the dumbest person in the room and that had a high level of integrity.  \n\n* The field didn't matter to her, and it did not have to be in a field where she had experience.   \n\n* She was talking with a consultant in the field who recommended she talk to the company where she works now. \n\n* She reflected on the things she liked most in previous jobs. \n\n* She realized at some point in a previous role that she had not been committed to learning and decided to lean into it (taking courses, coaching, mentoring).  \n\n* Focusing in on what she loved about coaching and mentoring others. \n\n* At this point in her career, a strong mentor and a strong boss are critical. \n\n* Surrounding herself with people smarter than her makes Kate feel more comfortable and that she is growing and learning. \n\n* Hire to your weaknesses.  Get people better than you that you can learn from, and Kate learns from her team every single day. \n\n## 22:57 - [[Approaching Interviews]] \n\n* How does Kate's approach to interviewing another woman change based on her experiences with the process? \n\n* She is careful not to ask questions that may make the candidate feel uncomfortable. \n\n* She gets annoyed when someone does not try to negotiate their salary (especially women). \n\n* It's challenging for women to ask for more money, but Kate celebrates when it happens. \n\n* In performance reviews, people use the words \"I feel / think I have accomplished X.\" \n\n* You don't have to say I think / I feel.  You did it! \n\n* This behavior is a pattern for women that Kate has seen. \n\n* There is a role to play in mentoring and coaching to make everyone better. \n\n* Nick cites the [interview with Brad Christian](https://nerd-journey.com/career-insight-from-the-manager-lens-with-brad-christian-2-2/) in which Brad says technical people are too humble about their accomplishments.  [[Brad Christian]] \n\n* For the male bosses who are managing women as direct reports, seek an open and honest relationship, and listen to feedback.  Be inclusive and helpful.  Make sure you understand the perspective from your employee's side. \n\n## 26:52 - Thoughts on the Tech Industry \n\n* Kate is relatively new to the tech industry.  Here experience in radiology was that it is like the tech industry of medicine. \n\n* VMUG has just launched a diversity and inclusion advisory council.  This is in the early stages, and hearing how much everyone wants to address this makes them take it even more seriously so as not to be just lip service. \n\n* VMUG has 3 female board members. \n\n* There is much work that needs to be done in the diversity and inclusion field (in addition to inclusion of women).  \n\n* It's uncomfortable to be the only woman on a large call.  Kate does a lot of financial management and reporting.  Right now this is a committee full of all men.  Another woman will be joining the committee soon, and Kate is excited about that. \n\n* Does this lessen the blind spots of others? \n\n* What about men as direct reports to women? \n\n* Kate shares a story of throwing a baby shower for a member of the team that was a man when his wife was about to have a baby.  Maybe a male boss would not have thought to do this. \n\n* As it relates to VMUG, there are not a lot of women members, but it seems like those who are members are somewhat active. \n\n* We need to tackle getting more women students interested in the IT field in general. \n\n* Whose responsibility is this?  VMUG may not be solely responsible for this, but they can help.   \n\n* Kate didn't see examples of women in science or technology when she was younger, and those examples matter. \n\n* Check out [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) and [Dell Women's Entrepreneur Network](https://dwen.com/) as ways to contribute. \n\n* It all comes back to being open about how we think, how we feel, what we worry about so that we and others can be more empathetic to others. \n\n* If we can make everyone more comfortable talking to one another it would go a long way.  That may also be the formula for world peace (an ambitious goal). \n\n* It takes time to develop deep relationships to feel comfortable enough talking in an open way as described here. \n\n## 36:36 - Parting Thoughts \n\n* Follow what you are truly interested in.  People feel pressure to find a passion.  Kate encourages us to find what is making us curious, making us wonder, and making us ask more questions. That is where we should go. \n\n* Sometimes there are reasons you don't go in that direction like no other representation in that area.  This is all the more reason to go and stand out. \n\n* If you are asking a lot of questions about one specific thing there may be a reason why. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-119":{"title":"Episode 119","content":"\n# Episode 119\n\nWelcome to episode 119 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with David Klee in which we recount David's career journey from generalist to specialist through career changes and a move into consulting.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-12-2021 \n\nTopics – Career Path, Scaling up, Transition to Consulting, Body of Work  [[David Klee]] #MicrosoftMVP #VMwarevExpert\n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:39 - Meet David Klee \n\n* David Klee is a [Microsoft Data Platform MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview) and a [VMware vExpert](https://vexpert.vmware.com/).  He owns two companies: \n\n* [Heraflux Technologies](https://www.heraflux.com/) - They do business to business consulting around Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Data Platform and everything underneath related to performance and availability. \n\n* Virtually every application out there has some means to drive data to it.  David specializes in SQL Server and how it interacts with eevrything underneath it. \n\n* David has done a lot if presentations for VMUG, and Nick actually attended one the week before this recording happened. \n\n* [SQLibrium](https://www.sqlibrium.com/) provides training content for performance and availability tuning for the Microsoft SQL Server data platform and each layer of the infrastructure stack, be it physical, virtual, or cloud, underneath the database. \n\n## 5:10 - Walking the Career Path \n\n* This is a follow up to our discussions about generalists vs. specialists in [Episode 26](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-026-generalist-specialist-divide/).  Go back and listen if you have not. [[Episode 26]]\n\n* David's first computer was a Tandy Color Computer 3 at age 5.  His grandmother was a librarian.  He used to type in all the Basic code from magazines, spending hours playing around it and learning Basic by age 6 or 7. \n\n* His mom got tired of David breaking her computer, so he was able to build his own from various parts at age 8. \n\n* At 10 he was repairing computers for friends and family, which continued until age 16 or 17 (repairing anywhere from 10 - 20 computers per week). \n\n* There were a lot of modem lighting strikes he helped resolve for people. \n\n* In college David took over a Systems Administrator job for a small military contractor, learning Windows, SQL Server, and Microsoft Access. \n\n* He eventually discovered a copy of VMware Workstation in 1999 and put a copy of Windows NT 4 and SQL Server 6.5 on it, running on a hacked together computer he had built.  It worked great! \n\n* Helping people fix their computers allowed him to tinker with all kinds of technologies. It was really fun, different than normal kid jobs at the time, and allowed him to keep learning. \n\n* Family and friend tech support has not ended.  Most family members have somewhat disposable computers. \n\n* David studied Computer Science / Computer Engineering in college, which was mostly centered on programming. \n\n* From here David got a job as a programmer / application developer and found out he was terrible at it. \n\n* He understood it and could code but really did not like it, and it did not come naturally.  Many of the methodologies learned were challenging and stressful. \n\n* After a couple of years David realized the job was really not for him. \n\n* Omaha was opening a new performing arts center.  David took a job there as a Database and Systems Administrator. \n\n* He had kept up his Systems Administration chops through various side jobs and tinkering. \n\n* The performing arts center gave no thought to IT when they had initially planned its construction. \n\n* Listen to David's story about building a server room out of a janitorial closet he and his co-workers had to steal. \n\n* They had 42U of rack space and needed to run 37 servers.  Can you say virtualization? \n\n* David shares some great stories about having behind the scenes access at the performing arts center to see B.B. King and then a special all night personal concert. \n\n* It was the right place at the right time as David says.  He was part of a team of 3 that integrated 6 different arts organizations under one ticketing umbrella. \n\n* This required all kinds of skills related to SQL Server like website integration, disaster recovery, reporting, point of sales, and more.  He and the others designed this from the ground up. \n\n* David leveraged books along with a home lab for experimentation. \n\n* Listen closely to hear just how extensive David's home lab was at the time. \n\n* Building a lab teaches you what can happen if you do something incorrectly and how to recover form it. \n\n* Two years post implementation, a friend of David's said he shouldn't virtualize any important systems while sitting inside the performing arts center.  David took the opportunity to educate his friend that everything inside the performing arts center except the phone system was powered by virtual systems. \n\n* David stayed about 3 years at the performing arts center and even built a volunteer management system the house managers could use to gain efficiencies. \n\n* David leveraged this job as a way to learn .NET.  The performing arts center was using Excel to manage over 3000 volunteers, which was extremely taxing for performing arts center employees who managed the volunteers.  \n\n* David built this in 4 months from scratch (including the database design).  The first week it went live saved 50 man hours of time between two positions.  \n\n* This system was in place for 10 years before the company built a successor to David's original build. \n\n* By the time he left, the place was streamlined and running like a well oiled machine. \n\n## 19:50 - Scaling up with a Consulting Firm \n\n* Things were status quo.  David wanted to do something on a larger scale.  One of the volunteers at the performing arts center was a CIO at a financial group. \n\n* He helped virtualize the servers, setup disaster recovery, and a lot about 3rd party vendor application interaction with databases. \n\n* David was able to play with bigger and better technologies, supporting over 300 users and 16-17 lines of business each with its own ERP system.  This was the first time David had dealt with more than one large ERP system and had to make them all play nice together. \n\n* You have to know how the business is using the application to determine how to leverage it and make IT better. \n\n* David worked on a massive survey platform in one previous job but was an intermediary between two different team (platform builders and platform users).  These two teams were very disconnected. \n\n* The performing arts group was very similar but with multiple groups. \n\n* Can business change to work the way the ERP system works, or can you change the ERP system so it works the way a company does business? \n\n* These decisions need to be made before implementation but are not always that way. \n\n*David was part of a team of 7 here, acting as \"geek of all trades\" and taking on projects that his co-workers would rather not. \n\n*  \n\n* David wore a lot of hats at this company, and then another opportunity found him. \n\n* David got to know the founder of an Oracle consulting firm who was looking to have someone start a SQL consulting practice. \n\n* David found he liked working at many different things at the same time.  This new company ended up hiring him. \n\n* David had to ask his boss about interviewing with the new company. \n\n* David's boss at the time understood he wanted to \"deal with more\" and encouraged him to go for it. \n\n* At the time, David had a running train of thought about how an IT Professional breaks into the business side of a company where what you do contributes to the wellbeing of the business rather than keeping the lights on. \n\n* This was something David always wanted.  But when you are in the weeds, this is very difficult with companies at times treating IT like a cost sink and not a business driver. \n\n* To make a bigger difference to the business, David wanted to start specializing.  \n\n* This new company focused on the database side but they also dabbled with the components underneath (physical machine, storage, hypervisors).  This was in line with David's interests and a direction he wanted to go.   \n\n* The act of being a generalist made it easier for David to be affective as a specialist. He was able to look at things as a system and not individually to see pieces individually. \n\n* David stayed with the consulting firm for about 4 years and built up a big SQL Server Enterprise Consulting practice. \n\n* As part of this, he was on the ground floor of some industry shifts to virtualize major business applications. \n\n* He worked on some of the original SQL Server on VMware training and started working on projects for really large companies of all types. \n\n* Right around this time David started playing with Hyper-V also.   \n\n## 30:16 - Transition to Consulting \n\n* To go into multiple different industries with the same technologies and see different use cases, implementations, etc. was fascinating. \n\n* The learning curve never stopped, and David felt like he was interviewing for his job every single week. \n\n* He was able to see patterns in certain places he could apply elsewhere for getting better performance out of these systems. \n\n* Every month as a consultant you grow a year in professional experience due to seeing so many different things. \n\n* Most people see consultants as people who will challenge everything they have done or potentially take their job. \n\n* Many people want you at arm's length to prevent skeletons from being found in the closet. \n\n* David does not work like this, treating himself like part of the business, as someone who wants to help make things better and teaching people how to solve these problems in the future. \n\n* \"Don't call me back for the same problem.  I already showed you how to fix it.\" - David Klee \n\n* Keep in mind the customer may have been burned by other consultants who promised the world and got things that were not impactful or wrong. \n\n* Listen to David's story about running into this recently. \n\n* David loves giving away information away publicly. \n\n* He may not know everything, but what he does know is showcased in public facing evidence of his expertise. \n\n* Instead of being asked about his credentials these days he is asked if what is happening actually can be fixed.  Some of the challenges he has seen are quite significant. \n\n## 35:29 - A Body of Work \n\n* We should all be building a body of work. \n\n* In 2011, David was part of the SQL Server User Group in Omaha.  They had 60 or more attendees every month. \n\n* David and the group leader decided to put in a [SQL Saturday](https://sqlsaturday.com/) for attendees at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. \n\n* One of the speakers backed out, and David's friend said David would be presenting on SQL Server performance tuning on VMware.  \n\n* There were about 40 attendees, and David quite enjoyed himself. \n\n* About 3 months later, someone who had heard David's presentation reached out to him, asking him to co-present on the same topic at a much larger conference. \n\n* This happened to be the author of [SQL in a Nutshell](https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Nutshell-Desktop-Reference-OReilly/dp/0596518846). \n\n* The presentation was so packed they closed the room doors 30 minutes before it started because of fire code capacity constraints (over 500 people). \n\n* The track record of community speaking, blogging, and videos builds your reputation in a specific area. \n\n* This was unique in the industry and helped David make a name for himself. \n\n* Would it have been hard for David to go back to being a generalist? \n\n* He stayed up with the technology (infrastructure) and always kept up the home lab. \n\n* David still finds it being fun to figure out how the pieces relate to one another. \n\n* He still enjoys the SQL Server part of things but enjoys working on other projects like hypervisor upgrades and cloud migration.  It's fun for him. \n\n* Is greater specialization a gateway to more pay? \n\n* You hit a point where you become a specialist in a technology and stay at a company that will pay you for that specialty, or you become a consultant in that specialty and make good or better money with a lot more demands. \n\n* Or, you become the Enterprise Architect that understands all of the pieces conceptually and hand off to people who specialize in different areas. \n\n* There has always been a need for people to understand how the pieces work together. \n\n* David gives an example of someone he knew that was an Enterprise Architect. \n\n* This person understood when to hand things off to someone in another area. \n\n* The title is evolving.  The Infrastructure / Solution Architect were at some time the duty of the IT Director or Senior Engineer.   The roles have existed for a while, but the words around them have changed. \n\n## [Contact

12\n\nOriginal Recording Date 2018-09-23 \n\n## 2:47 – Effective 1-on-1 Meetings with Your Manager \n\n-   John stresses the importance of an agenda (to be created 24 hours or more ahead of time) \n    \n-   Both parties can contribute to the meeting agenda (manager and employee) \n    \n-   Meeting structure suffers without an agenda \n    \n-   How many listeners out there have weekly 1-on-1 meetings with their manager?  Let us know on social media! \n    \n-   A yearly performance review won't be a surprise if effective weekly 1-on-1 meetings are happening \n    \n### What constitutes giving your manager an action item? \n    \n-   Don't just bring problems / complaints.  Bring something you need help with and what you have already tried. \n-   Helpful asks – leveraging a manager's experience, leveraging a manager's relationship with other department \n-   Be prepared for feedback from your manager on any request \n\n## A 1-on-1 meeting is not the same as a project check-in meeting \n    \n-   The 1-on-1 is about your professional development / career journey (how to get better) \n\t\n-   Keep project update meetings separate \n        \n##  Career path questions \n\n^05e048\n\n-   What is the individual contributor career path or management career path for you? \n-   How can you get better at what you are doing? \n-   I have new interests / am requesting new challenges \n-   Pay raises are a separate conversation from career conversations \n   \n## Whose job is it to bring up career progression first (yours, your manager's, both)? \n-   In a good company culture, managers should be encouraged to have regular 1-on-1 meetings with direct reports \n-   A manager not bringing this up may just be oversight on his / her part and not intentional \n-   A lack of career progression conversations period could be a lack of organizational maturity \n-   Development of employees could reflect well the manager \n\n## Cadence for a 1-on-1 should be weekly but bi-weekly at a minimum \n-   Stick to the cadence! \n    \n### What are organizational barriers that prevent regular 1-on-1 meetings? \n    \n-   Proximity \n\t\n\t-   Manager and employee working in different locations \n\t\t\n\t\t-   Manager may have less visibility into employee day-to-day work \n\t\t\t\n\t-   Manager and employee working in the same location \n\t\t\n\t\t-   More difficult to have a long-term strategy \n\t\t\t\n\t\t-   Talking over the cube wall is usually a project update \n\t\t\t\n-   Managers with large number of reports \n\t\n\t-   Possible indication of lack of managers in the organization \n\t\t\n\t-   Not scalable for the manager \n\t\t\n\t-   Could cause infrequent conversations and feedback and frustration for both parties \n\t\t\n-   Culture \n\t\n\t-   Are 1-on-1s being encouraged from the top down? \n            \n-   Let us know if you want this topic revisited \n    \n\n26:19 – How to Leave Your Organization Gracefully \n\n-

     \n    -   Don’t bad-mouth people on the way out \n        \n        -   Just say you've been happy and it's time to move on \n            \n        -   Repeat until they stop asking \n            \n        -   Nick reminds us that the things you do on the way out can ruin your reputation at the organization you're leaving \n            \n    -   You need buffer cash in case you're walked out the door \n        \n        -   What if your new position offer is rescinded \n            \n        -   What if your new position's pay day is further away than you thought? \n            \n

[https://www.manager-tools.com/2011/11/what-do-with-a-counter-offer](https://www.manager-tools.com/2011/11/what-do-with-a-counter-offer) \n        \n    -   Don’t take a counter offer! \n        \n    -   If you have reasons to leave, will more money really change all the other things? \n        \n    -   You're alerting your current employer that you need to be replaced, even if you accept the counter \n        \n    -   Ideally you'd leave on your timeline, not your employer's \n        \n    -   Taking a counter burns the relationship with the recruiter, hiring manager, and prospective new employer \n        \n    -   If it's just money, you should have had a different conversation \n        \n    -   If they only give you a raise after you have an offer, that's not a healthy place \n        \n    -   If additional compensation was dangled in the past without follow-through, there's no reason to believe they'd follow-through with what's promised in a counter \n        \n    -   What if you take the counter and they don't follow through again? \n        \n    -   If an employer refuses to give you compensation until the counter-offer \n        \n        -   Either calculated that they could get away with not compensating you at the level they valued you \n            \n        -   Or they're keeping you in the position short term while they search for your cheaper replacement. \n            \n\n49:00 Outtro \n\n49:55 Stinger \"I said it this time!\"","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-120":{"title":"Episode

In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with David Klee in which he recounts the birth of his business, how previous experience helped him succeed, how he keeps things fresh, and career advice for the IT Generalist.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-12-2021 \n\nDavid Klee is a [Microsoft Data Platform MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview) and a [VMware vExpert](https://vexpert.vmware.com/).  He owns two companies - [Heraflux Technologies](https://www.heraflux.com/) and [SQLibrium](https://www.sqlibrium.com/).  Catch part 1 of out interview with David in [Episode 119](http://nerd-journey.com/tinkering-toward-specialty-with-david-klee-1-2).  [[David Klee]] [[Episode 119]] \n\nTopics – Flying Solo, Drawing on Previous Experience, IT Pro Advice, SQLibrium, Keeping Things Fresh, Parting Thoughts \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:23 - Flying Solo \n\n* David was watching public cloud technologies evolve, and the company he was at wasn't too interested in that.  They were looking more at license assessments, and David wanted a more holistic approach. \n\n* Around this time he sought to do his own thing to explore various technologies and get back to the data lifecycle to help people  \n\n* David was traveling almost nonstop and needed more control over that. \n\n* He had made a name for himself in the SQL Server and VMware communities. \n\n* He had a strict noncompete from the previous consulting firm to deal with as well. \n\n* David hoped word of mouth from technical communities would bring him customers, and he received his first project on day 3 after stepping out on his own. \n\n* His business officially started September 1, 2013. \n\n* He had to fly to Denver to help this new customer solve their problem. \n\n* David advertised with blog posts, on LinkedIn, and on Twitter.  The connections he had made in the SQL Community really helped him be successful. \n\n* David would not wish owning a consulting firm on anyone who doesn't understand what it really takes. \n\n* There is a lot of sacrifice that comes along with it. \n\n* Being self-employed brings concerns about healthcare, difference in processes of getting loans, etc. \n\n* His family was supportive of the choice, but they set a deadline at which they would re-evaluate and pivot if needed. \n\n* They had a backup plan (money saved just in case). \n\n* The act of getting the business up and running was not cheap, but really good projects came in early to help stabilize things. \n\n* Everyone's perspective of going out on your own is different. \n\n* Some have customer lists and were moonlighting on the side. \n\n* David had a word of mouth reputation and a website.  He had money for startup, money for a decent burn rate, and a list of events to get the word out. \n\n* If you don't have a plan for making your first few sales, don't jump in until you are ready.  Listen to David's simple example of the timeline of quote to cash. \n\n* All kinds of legal contracts need to be written up, all of which are custom to the customer. \n\n* David understood several things from experience at the previous consulting firm.   \n\n* He found a very good lawyer to help in the beginning.   \n\n* But this does not remove the need to have contracts reviewed by legal teams of his customers and any changes that are required to do business with them. \n\n* On day 1, David had his hands in most everything.  His wife was kind enough to help with a lot of the back end items. \n\n## 11:59 - Drawing on Previous Experience \n\n* David had done a lot of pre-Sales work before forming his own company and would often do some or all of the post-Sales implementation work. \n\n* What about being perceived as a Sales guy as owner of his own consulting firm? \n\n* David treats pre-Sales more as technical discussions.  Tell me what you think needs to be done, and let's brainstorm on what actually needs to be done.  \n\n* David approaches things as low pressure.  You either want his help or you don't.  He brings a set of candor to pre-Sales discussions.  Pre-Sales is the discovery of what is needed to complete the task. \n\n* This approach validates concerns that something is a problem. \n\n* Many times David has to tell people the problem is layers deeper than they think. \n\n* What about changing the company specialty based on market need? \n\n* Listen to how David turns a question into an explanation of how his company was named (Heraflux Technologies), which actually answers it perfectly. \n\n* The answer is…he does this constantly by staying on top of technology trends. \n\n* If you are in IT, you must continue to evolve and change with the technology. \n\n* David shares a story about a friend whose specialty was eliminated by technological change who was not able to adjust. \n\n* David is neck deep in the Microsoft Data Platform at present but also learning about cloud database instances. The NoSQL database concept with MongoDB and CosmosDB is quite fascinating for the right use case.  Listen to David's examples of how SQL Server could still be used in conjunction with these. \n\n* David likes to read up on what is going on in the industry, looking for new technologies that can solve business problems in new ways.  If he finds something useful he likes to conduct a 300-level hands-on overview before using for his customers. \n\n## 19:27 - Advice for the #Generalist IT Pro \n\n* Your interests vs. what you do for your day job could be different things.  Hopefully those two line up. \n\n* David recommends thinking about what makes you smile and what you find cool.  Start reading up on those things. \n\n* A hobby today could become a day job / side project tomorrow. \n\n* If you find you enjoy it in tinkering, there's a high probability you will find out you really enjoy it once it becomes a full time job. \n\n* Nick makes the point that someone who enjoys blogging and presenting, for example, may like technical marketing as a career but may have less control over the content they cover than when it was a hobby. \n\n* How much of the day do I dread, and how much do I enjoy?  If the positives outweigh the negatives, stick with it. \n\n* If you hit a point where the negatives outweigh the positives, revisit the hobbies and the things you enjoy about that job.  Figure out if there is another role within the same company or at a different company that can get you back to what you really enjoy. \n\n* Many people don't want the change that comes along with looking for a new job.  \n\n* If you are unhappy in your job, the people around you can see it (peers, your boss, your family, etc.). \n\n* The blessing of COVID-19 is that it has proven many roles can be done remotely. \n\n* Even if you work somewhere with very few technical jobs in the area, COVID has opened the doors for you to look at larger companies without needing to relocate or step inside an office. \n\n* This also hurts people in the same town who might be looking for work, but it provides more options and directions for all of us.  David sees it as a good thing. \n\n* Companies offered work from home opportunities before COVID, but many were forced to enable this because of the pandemic.  Likely remote work becomes table stakes for an interview discussion. \n\n* David says many companies he worked with assumed people would work better if face to face in an office and that they would slack off if working from home. \n\n* Datacenters are not usually in the next room from us, even when we work in an office. \n\n* Before the pandemic David traveled 150 - 250 days per year for 11 years straight. \n\n* Ask about travel policies if you are going to become a consultant. \n\n* Travel for work is not glamorous like people think.  You see an airport, a hotel, and an office park almost exclusively.  One perk is local cuisine. \n\n* David's travel during the pandemic went to zero during the pandemic, and he has proven he can do the job remotely despite some things taking longer. \n\n* In the past he would do a 40 hour boot camp with everyone in the same room to minimize distractions. \n\n* Now he has to schedule parts of days with customers because there are so many distractions with remote meetings.  Knowing that going into it allows you to plan for it. \n\n* Moving to 100% remote work added more structure to his day to some extent. \n\n* He got weekends back.  Usually every other weekend was doing some kind of travel. \n\n* When you and your body expect to be in different places multiple times per month it becomes a way of life. \n\n* Seeing the same 4 walls for so long can create the itch to travel again. \n\n* David does not think he will ever travel to the extent he did before the pandemic. \n\n* There will likely be a new normal for conferences and events.  David used to travel a great deal for VMUG and SQL Saturday events. \n\n* He thinks there will likely be a remote aspect of events moving forward, and it will be an interesting shift in how the world reacts. \n\n* David is not traveling the rest of this year and doesn't know about next year but is keeping an eye on things. \n\n* Maybe conferences will allow remote speakers moving forward? \n\n* For now, David has no in person commitments.  \n\n## 28:41 - The Birth of #SQLibrium \n\n* David would do boot camps and training all over the world. The lack of travel from the pandemic has limited the in-person opportunities for training on various topics. \n\n* They decided as a company it was time to come up with an on-demand platform. \n\n* In-person training will forever change because of the pandemic. \n\n* People want the ability to watch a session, go look at their environment, and then take some notes.  In-person offerings did not allow this. \n\n* With in-person trainings, David had to answer questions for people for months after the fact (does not scale well). \n\n* David took the best thing he is known for (SQL Server on VMware Performance and Availability Tuning) and chose it as the first 8-hour offering. \n\n* A sister company of Heraflux called SQLibrium was formed and launched February 4, 2021. \n\n* The domain name was something they bought and sat on a number of years ago. \n\n* There will be a SQL Server on Linux course to come, one on general database tuning, one on Hyper-V, and hopefully a couple on using SQL Server and IaaS across public cloud environments. \n\n* David wants people to call him for the hard stuff and share his knowledge of common patterns. \n\n* This allows him to go deeper than he could in-person, setup interesting labs, and really cover everything needed within the course. \n\n## 33:08 - Keeping Things Fresh \n\n* David keeps his eyes open on where the industry is going, where the bleeding edge front runners are going, and looks at how this might be beneficial to business. \n\n* In addition to consulting and making courses for SQLibrium he has a start on 2 commercial products around performance and availability tuning. \n\n* If you study where things are going and where they have been in the past, you can anticipate whether you might need to incorporate something new into what you already do. \n\n* Virtualizing SQL was taboo ten years ago but is now a given. \n\n* How do you get an IT person into the mind of the business and figure out where they need to go, and how do you understand what technology to push them into to ensure they land appropriately? \n\n* It's easier for IT personnel to swing the business in a certain direction is easier than it used to be. \n\n* Be consistently on the lookout for opportunities to modernize with new technologies. \n\n* Today at Heraflux, there are 3 full time employees (David, his wife, and a Sales and Business Development professional). \n\n* They have started a referral network among experts in the industry and can act as subcontractors for one another based on the specialty need. \n\n* They can scale as needed without overhead of having full time people on board. \n\n* The scale out model in place works very well for them right now. \n\n* David had not really managed people before starting his own company. \n\n* He does not like to micromanage or second guess his employees and doesn't have to do either of these things. \n\n* \"We all just want to fix stuff and make things better.\" \n\n# 38:30 - Parting Thoughts on Career \n\n* The best [[Career Advice]] David received was run with what you enjoy because what you enjoy is the intersection of multiple distinct things.  The act of specializing in how multiple distinct things work together is really rare. \n\n* If you like multiple things that work together for a business running well but that many don't understand, run with it.  David received advice from others that this kind of thing was going to get some attention. \n\n* The worst career advice was from his high school English teacher who called him a moron and said he would never amount to anything. \n\n* David feels he has made an impact and that he has fun with what he does. \n\n* How do people get started building a body of work? \n\n* Generally speaking, IT personnel are introverts that like knowledge but don't like being around people. \n\n* Networking with others is something you have to force yourself to learn to do. \n\n* Get networking with people around you with similar interests (regardless of career field). \n\n* So many user groups are virtual now. \n\n* Find people with like minded interest.  If you are interested in starting to specialize, start to explore what you really enjoy. \n\n* For pieces of your job that you like, read up on it. Learn it well enough to explain to others how to do it. \n\n* There are always 5-10 presentations that take place at user groups.  Start there. \n\n* \"Find something you enjoy.  Tell somebody about it.\"  - David Klee \n\n* Find a junior person in their role, and show them how to do a couple things.   \n\n* David gets a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment from hearing people say something is cool and that they will take it and use it. \n\n* The technology discussions David has have become the marketing avenues for him and his company. \n\n* People remember people who talk to them.   \n\n* Ask others if they have side projects you can work on (assuming your employment agreement allows it). \n\n* Find someone to learn from.  Apprenticeship is something we need more of in our country as it allows people to find out if they will really enjoy a line of work.  \n\n* Mentor others, and be mentored. \n\n* Get out of your comfort zone and network. \n\n* People will call you if they need something.  Build up that network.   \n\n* If you are interested in going out on your own, the generalist side of you will help you understand what you're coming from.  The specialist side will help you figure out where you want to go. \n\n* Being a specialist with the generalist background allows a pivot as your personal situation changes. \n\n* If you want to start your own business, contact David to hear the good, bad, and the ugly. \n\n* There are many ways to do it. \n\n* Do you have healthcare, money saved up to get started, a drop dead date to allow yourself to do something else, etc.?   \n\n* It's always a challenge.  David loves it, but it is not for everyone. \n\n* You need two things… \n\n* Something that makes you special enough in what you do that people would be wiling to pay you to do it. \n\n* You need a personal situation to allow personal instability to be able to do it. \n\n* Contact David on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidaklee/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kleegeek), or the contact pages on one of his sites to setup a call (no strings attached, no marketing): \n\n* [Heraflux Technologies](https://www.heraflux.com/contact/) \n\n* [SQLibrium](https://www.sqlibrium.com/contact) \n\n* [DavidKlee.net](https://www.heraflux.com/contact/) \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-121":{"title":"Episode 121","content":"\n# Episode 121\n\nWelcome to episode 121 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Brianna Blacet in which Brianna shares her experience being a writer, moving into Science and Technology, and what it really takes to write a book.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-21-2021 \n\nTopics – College Years, Science and Technology, Writing Books \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:20 - Meet Brianna Blacet \n\n* Brianna Blacet is an Innovation Storyteller at VMware, which she says is the best title in the entire company. [[Brianna Blacet]] #VMware \n\n* The title has become chic in the last few years, and depending on where you are, might just mean you are a writer.  There could be much more media as part of it. \n\n* There is a difference between writing a datasheet compared to telling a story. \n\n* Stories move people.  In Brianna's job, she tells stories of innovation within [VMware's Office of the CTO](https://octo.vmware.com). \n\n## 4:22 - College Years \n\n* Brianna was one of those kids who started reading super early.  She used to immerse herself in books to feel safe and to let her imagination wander. \n\n* Sometimes being a writer chooses you.  Brianna doesn’t think she ever wanted to be anything else but did not feel it would be something she could do as a career. \n\n* Both of her parents are physicists. \n\n* She went to UC Santa Cruz and studied Environmental Studies to make her parents think she was studying Science. \n\n* [Page Stegner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Stegner) was one of her professors during her senior year, and he taught a class on Environmental Writing that Brianna ended up taking.   [[Page Stegner]]\n\n* To be in the class, you had to take a 10-day river rafting trip in Arizona.  He wanted his students to immerse themselves in nature. \n\n* There is a big difference between reading about the Grand Canyon and floating on a raft through a canyon.  It changes you. \n\n* This reminds Nick of reading about the way Pixar would have the folks making a film immerse themselves in the details of the story, often times visiting a specific place to do research and ensuring every small detail was correct. \n\n* How can you write a story until you let yourself feel those emotions and see those images?  That is what separates writing from a story according to Brianna. \n\n* Brianna found something special here.  She found that being a writer was not what her parents believed it to be.  This professor changed something in Brianna forever, and she believed she could do it. \n\n* Before graduating, she talked herself into a job writing about water politics at a paper (a reporter). \n\n## 11:38 - Science and Technology \n\n* She then decided to go to Graduate School as was part of a Science and Technology Journalist program. \n\n* She had learned that being a general reporter pays very low and had taken a Science writing course that same year in school, which is not what her parents thought it was. \n\n* It's not looking through a microscope all day. \n\n* Brianna is great with general concepts but does not go deep. \n\n* She referenced [The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Mistook_His_Wife_for_a_Hat) by [[Oliver Sacks]].  [[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]\n\n* This is a book about curious stories of medicine.  There are a number of stories about people in the Scientific field. \n\n* As part of the program, she wrote about all kinds of things.  They had to study graduate level Chemistry, Physics, Genetics, etc. \n\n* They might write a news story about things happening in the news like new discoveries in Genetic Sequencing, for example, and it could have been newspaper style or magazine style (very different). \n\n* One of her professors was a medical reporter at the New York Times, and Brianna mentioned one of the most well known writers currently writing about COVID came from this same program. \n\n* The stories of COVID are real people, and the people who solve these problems are real heroes.  It's human science with a lot of deep, dramatic stories. \n\n* Was there a fear of being a specialist? \n\n* No!  When Brianna worked at the newspaper, she had to report on things in all areas, and she hated it. \n\n* She learned that when you are a generalist, you are competing with a lot more people. \n\n* When you become a writer, you have some options.  You can be really poor, you can have 3 jobs, or you can pick a specialty that is profitable. \n\n* Picking Science and Technology narrowed the competition significantly and increased the pay. \n\n* Nick admits to enjoying writing documentation, but technical writing is not for everyone  \n\n* Challenges from being a woman? \n\n* Brianna hadn't been asked this question.  Her mother is a PhD Physicist who got the degree in the 1960s. \n\n* She never saw these barriers as a kid.  Her parents never placed limits on what she could be. \n\n* Unfortunately, what Brianna did find was a lot of sexual harassment in the workplace. \n\n* She is grateful to the [Metoo movement](https://metoomvmt.org/) and others that are helping to fight against this today. [[Me Too]]\n\n* In the writing field, people don't care who you are. They care about whether you can write. \n\n* Getting the first few articles or books published and showing that off may not even reveal whether you are a woman. \n\n* Brianna thinks she may not have been promoted at times in her career because of being a woman. \n\n* Being a woman in a newsroom environment can be tough.  She wrote medical news for a while, and it was brutal. \n\n* She was called names people only call women, and it was a lot of pressure.  Listen to her story of assigned news stories sitting on her desk when she arrived at the office. \n\n* If you want to be a writer, 80% of your career is writing about stuff you don't want to write about under very tight deadline pressure. \n\n* Brianna gives the example of really wanting to write for American Health Magazine and having to take some trivial assignments before being given a big assignment. \n\n* This was to pay dues and show what you can do. \n\n* Writer's block is the luxury of the non-writer. \n\n* Being a writer is the least glamorous job.  If you really like it, hang with it. \n\n## 23:21 - Writing Books \n\n* Nick mentioned many people in the tech industry have written books.   \n\n* Writing books is hard.  Brianna questions everyone who wants to write a book.   \n\n* Her husband is a fiction writer. \n\n* Books are long, slow, slogs.  People came to Brianna asking her to write a book because they had seen her work displayed in magazines. \n\n* If it is Science or Technology and takes you a year you are a really fast writer. \n\n* Everything you write, whether 500 words or 50,000 words it is made up of components. \n\n* The best thing to do to write a book is writing a list of chapters, breaking the book down into tiny pieces.  You must have structure. \n\n* Start with a table of contents and a summary. \n\n* If you cannot concisely explain what your book is about in one paragraph, you don't have your idea fleshed out. \n\n* If you can't write a list of the chapters, you have not thought it through enough.  It must be that crystal clear in your mind. \n\n* Abstracts for conferences are a good example of a type of pitch.  A pitch to a publisher is like pitching an ad that must encapsulate all the drama of the story. \n\n* This discussion reminded Nick of reading [George Lucas: A Life](https://www.amazon.com/George-Lucas-Brian-Jay-Jones/dp/0316257443) and hearing about the process of writing treatments for Star Wars. [[George Lucas: A Life]]\n\n    * You don't write a book.  You write a draft of a book. \n\n* If you want to write fiction, you have to find an agent.  Publishers want to hear from agents they trust.  Once you find an agent, you work with your agent so they can make the pitch. \n\n* With nonfiction, it may depend on the publishing company and the type of book. \n\n* You can get a book gig by being a good writer or by being a subject matter expert.  It's less likely that both of these qualities are within the same human, but if they are, kudos to you! \n\n* Brianna learned to write what she knows as the best way to write.  You have to know what you are writing about. \n\n* \"Writing isn't about writing.  It's about content.  Writing is a user interface for ideas.  Words are an artifice that we humans use to convey information to each other.\" - Brianna Blacet \n\n* You can be the best writer in the world, but if the story you are telling isn't good, no one cares.  Wordsmithing is not writing. \n\n* At work right now, Brianna helps subject matter experts tell their stories. \n\n* Context is part of telling the right story. \n\n* People might come to Brianna and say they want to write a story for the blog.  She then helps them determine the audience for their story. \n\n* Is it for a specific audience, is it for a group of peers, etc.?  Listen to her example of helping someone in machine learning write a high level overview of it. \n\n* Context is important, and the best way to know is to ask. \n\n* Unless you can tell a story in a way it has never been told, beware that someone may have already written that story. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-122":{"title":"Episode 122","content":"\n# Episode 122\n\nWelcome to episode 122 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Brianna Blacet in which Brianna shares tips for improving your writing, how we can use storytelling in the interview process, and how she keeps things fresh in her field.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-21-2021 \n\nBrianna Blacet is an Innovation Storyteller at [Vmware](https://octo.vmware.com) and happens to be a writer.  Catch part 1 of our interview with her in [Episode 121](https://nerd-journey.com/the-writer-and-the-storyteller-with-brianna-blacet-1-2). \n\nTopics – Improving Your Writing, Stories in the Interview Process, Career Advice [[Brianna Blacet]] #VMware [[Episode 121]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:35 - Getting Better at #Writing \n\n* Nick mentioned people in the tech industry starting out with blog writing to show proof of work and gives the example of [David Klee](https://nerd-journey.com/a-time-to-build-with-david-klee-2-2) using blogs to launch a company.  [[David Klee]]\n\n* How do people decide what to write about if they want to blog? \n\n* Think of what you write as a product.  If you are a subject matter expert you are selling your expertise.  Look at the market and the competition. \n\n* When Brianna was paying her dues as a an upcoming writer, she was told what to write and had her work tweaked many times by editors. \n\n* With the democratization of media, we all have the opportunity to tell our story directly to the world with no intermediary and no editor. \n\n* For example, you can publish articles on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) directly.  People want to see writing samples. \n\n* Other ideas include writing short pieces on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) or gaining a following on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). \n\n* You could tell your story through video or audio if that is preferred. \n\n* Getting noticed is a different story, but as far as telling your story, the world is your oyster! \n\n* The length of the content…depends. \n\n* If you are writing for social media, for example, the millennial generation has been raised with short form content. \n\n* Sometimes people want to consume things in bite size pieces.  But there are ways to format your content with subheadings to make it look like short form content. \n\n* You can become well recognized on Twitter in 280 characters over time.  \n\n* How frequently should someone post their content? \n\n* Consistency is key. \n\n* Brianna is a podcaster and learned out of the gate that the number 1 determinant of podcast success is keeping up the cadence. \n\n* This is the world of a news feed where things scroll by quickly.  In a world of Instagram stories, you had better post all the time.  Things are gone in a heartbeat. \n\n* It helps to post multiple times per day.   \n\n* Look at what others do (your competition) and go do it better! \n\n* You are competing for attention.  There is so much information out there and only so much you can digest.  You are competing for the attention span of someone.   \n\n* If you want to be a writer, you have to be faster, stronger, and better than the competition. \n\n* Nick thinks back to reading [Made to Stick](https://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others/dp/1400064287) by [[Chip and Dan Heath]] and how we learn through stories. [[Made to Stick]]\n\n* At work, Brianna has to give presentations on storytelling and on thought leadership. \n\n* She does not come from the corporate world and doesn’t tell the story the same way as others.  She uses minimal slides and humor  \n\n* Storytelling is the original human form of communication.  People told stories to explain what was happening in the world. \n\n* Think about mythology. \n\n* As a person now, what are the first things you remember? It's stories we hear. \n\n* Stories evoke pictures, sensory perception, etc. \n\n* Listen to the example Brianna gives of communicating directly vs. telling a story and the impact on the audience. \n\n## 15:07 - Incorporating Stories \n\n* How does storytelling play into the interview process? \n\n* A popular question interviewers ask is to have the candidate walk them through how they got started. \n\n* Instead of walking the person through your resume, tell them a story about your career. \n\n* Think back to Brianna's story about her writing professor from [last week's episode](https://nerd-journey.com/the-writer-and-the-storyteller-with-brianna-blacet-1-2).  You would probably remember her more after hearing that than if she had explained it differently. \n\n* You want people to be able to relate to the protagonist (many times that would be you but could be someone else).   \n\n* A story evokes emotion and cements an image in the mind. \n\n* Listen to Brianna's made up story given to a collaboration software company to illustrate the power of story and its impact. \n\n* Find that story about yourself to use in the interview.  You have one to tell. \n\n* Nick references a story from [our interview with Paul Green](https://nerd-journey.com/leadership-and-supporting-employee-potential-with-paul-green/) about his lead developer. \n\n* Brianna will be doing a storytelling workshop for Sales teams next week. \n\n* Sharing a customer story can be extremely impactful for Sales teams. \n\n* Sharing stories can be impactful in so many situations. \n\n* Take television marketing ads, for example.  So many of them are shared in stories to make the message more impactful. \n\n* Brianna uses the example of car commercials.  People want to feel like the people they see in the commercials.  \n\n* Thought leadership is really just influencing, and it goes hand in hand with storytelling. \n\n## 23:08 - Keeping It Fresh and Parting Thoughts \n\n* Brianna is different in that she is not a technologist.  She is a Science Writer helping people from all over the company tell stories. \n\n* You can tell the story from different angles. \n\n* This is a great job for Brianna because new stories come in every single day, and she tries to publish several blogs per week. \n\n* Helping people tell their stories is what we're doing when we have things like calls for papers at conferences or small user groups.   \n\n* Nick would encourage anyone who has never done something like this, written a blog, shared content in some way to consider doing it. \n\n* Brianna says the best way to measure the story you are telling is through analytics.  How do I know if the blogs are working? \n\n* She uses analytics to show her what length of posts may be best. \n\n* You can even measure when podcast listeners, for example, abandon the episode. \n\n* Measuring the success of things done verbally is tough because people will lie to you. \n\n* Nick tries not to focus too much on the metrics of blogs and podcasts because it can drive you crazy.  Brianna is obsessed with metrics. \n\n* You could write the best book in the world, but if there is no audience or measurement, it won't succeed. \n\n* Nick recently read [High Performance Habits](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Habits-Extraordinary-People/dp/1401952852) by Brendon Burchard.  The author recounts wanting to write a New York Times bestseller, and the steps needed to do it were not what he originally thought because he did not effectively get the word out in previous writing attempts. \n\n* If you want to be a writer, you will hustle every single day and sell your writing every single day.  It’s a lot of Sales and a lot of pitching. \n\n* Final career tips \n\n* Always be true to yourself.  Brianna's parents guided her away from being a writer. \n\n* Do your homework all the time.  Never forget that if you want it, there is someone else who wants it too.  Be ready to work very hard.   \n\n* Being a writer is hard and not glamorous.   \n\n* If you don’t love what you do, go do something else.  Life is too short. \n\n* Brianna loves what she does and loves to mentor people.   \n\n* She's open to providing feedback on the writing of others, and if you want to be a writer, she would love to talk to you! \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-123":{"title":"Episode 123","content":"\n# Episode 123\n\nWelcome to episode 123 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Josh Duffney and discuss his early career progression through learning PowerShell, participating in technical communities, becoming a PluralSight author, and making an interesting transition from Systems Administration to DevOps Engineering.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-03-2021 \n\nTopics – Early Career, Learning PowerShell, Community Participation, PluralSight Author, Sacrifice, Systems Administrator to DevOps Engineer  \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:44 - Meet Josh Duffney \n\n* [Josh Duffney](https://duffney.io/) is a Content Developer for Microsoft.  He writes content on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/) and focuses on Ansible, Terraform, PowerShell, and Azure CLI.  [[Josh Duffney]] #Microsoft \n\n* Josh works with a Product Manager for each technology stack mentioned.  Some of the documentation is based on customer feedback, but there is also a great deal of freedom to shape the content roadmap. \n\n* Josh has been with Microsoft for about 4 months. In the last month, he has spent time doing analysis of documentation in the Ansible space as it relates to Azure. \n\n* Josh works with Product Managers and Technical Writers and can think of his writing beyond a blog post series and more from an information architecture standpoint. \n\n* Content development is still development.  They use software development principles to build and release documentation.  Instead of building infrastructure, Josh is building documentation. \n\n## 5:53 - Early Career and Learning PowerShell \n\n* Nick and Josh crossed paths originally in the [Spiceworks community](https://community.spiceworks.com/). \n\n* At a previous employer, Josh was working on a disk space report which his manager expected daily at 8 AM via e-mail. \n\n* The server in question ran everything for the business including e-mail, print services, and acted as a domain controller.  Josh had to login to the server daily to pull the needed information to put in his report. \n\n* Josh saw this as a mundane task and vented to the Spiceworks community.  Someone suggested he script the task and run it on a schedule, which worked great.   \n\n* After seeing he could do so much work with code, Josh was interested PowerShell. \n\n* Josh then transitioned to working at a large construction company near where he lived in Bellevue, Nebraska. \n\n* He was part of a large help desk team and deemed one of the two \"script kids.\" \n\n* The team would often get tickets that involved making changes for hundreds of users at a time.  Writing scripts made this much easier and sharpened Josh's skills. \n\n* In previous roles Josh was a one man department and didn't get enough repetitive tasks for a good handle on scripting. \n\n* The script kid title was a slang appreciative term for what Josh and his teammate saved the tier 2 team in terms of workload.  There was no specific direction on what they should automate, but they jumped at anything and everything they could touch with PowerShell (Active Directory, Sharepoint, etc.). \n\n* The help desk team was the ingress of technology related tickets for the entire company.  The level 1 and level 2 teams would handle whatever they could and escalate to other dedicated teams when needed. \n\n* Working as part of this help desk team exposed Josh to all the layers of technology and provided a broad range of experiences. \n\n* Josh had a big goal to get into the network team and was studying for his CCIE.  He had taken it two times previously and failed but later passed when he took it for the 3rd time.   \n\n* But after getting the certification, Josh found himself focusing on PowerShell. \n\n* After about 8 months of working the help desk, Josh applied for a Systems Engineer position.  This involved managing SCCM, operating system deployments, and application installs. \n\n* He scripted as much as he could with PowerShell. \n\n* This was about the time Josh got into the PowerShell community. \n\n* He started automating both driver deployment and application deployment with SCCM as the delivery vehicle but PowerShell as the automation behind it. \n\n* This role was more project based to a degree than working the help desk and gave Josh the opportunity to hone his skills a bit more. \n\n## 14:17 - Community Participation \n\n* Josh's career really began in the [Spiceworks community](https://community.spiceworks.com/). \n\n* Josh's first job out of college was working help desk for a small engineering firm.  His firs project was to choose a new ticketing system platform. \n\n* He chose the [Spiceworks Help Desk Platform](https://www.spiceworks.com/download/help-desk/) and immediately got involved in the community. \n\n* Josh's boss was a firefighter and was not in the office much.  Leveraging both the Spiceworks community really helped him learn how to use many new tools within the environment. \n\n* He considers the Spiceworks community as well as the PowerShell community incubators for his career. \n\n* Adding a second community to his repertoire provided \"more things to chase\" and more people to learn from.  \n\n* One of Josh's favorite books is [Give and Take](https://www.amazon.com/Give-Take-Helping-Others-Success/dp/0143124986) by Adam Grant.  At the very top and very bottom of reciprocity models is the giver. \n\n* Josh looks to participate in communities where he can be a top giver but also reap the benefit of participation in the greater community (i.e. a selfish giver as Josh calls it). \n\n* You can only be a lurker for so long in a community before you start giving.  But once you contribute something others find helpful it fuels you to keep doing it. \n\n* One of the first few [how-tos Josh wrote in the Spiceworks community](https://community.spiceworks.com/people/duffney/activity/how-tos) had to do with imaging a Windows 7 machine with [FOG](https://fogproject.org/).  \n\n* Josh mentioned even 7 years after he wrote it, people were still commenting on it.  To see this was extremely rewarding. \n\n* There was less hesitancy to start participating in the PowerShell community when Josh joined. \n\n* It was not a big forum site like Spiceworks. \n\n* Josh heard about Microsoft TechEd (the predecessor to [Microsoft Ignite](https://myignite.microsoft.com/home)) and started watching the sessions online.  He noticed presenters listed their Twitter handle and later decided to start being active on Twitter too. \n\n* Josh started following every [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/) who had PowerShell in their bio. \n\n* He started interacting with people on Twitter and answering questions, feeling more comfortable reaching out to people directly over time. \n\n* Participating in these communities provided some validation that his ideas were worthwhile. \n\n* When you are the youngest / most junior person on a team, getting the social validation of your ideas from communities makes you more comfortable being an idealistic person willing to share with your teammates at the office. \n\n* Sometimes this type of validation can give you the confidence to go and do the next thing, get the next job, etc. \n\n* Josh mentioned this gave him permission to keep redefining what he wanted for his career. \n\n* Right after college, Josh wanted to be a game designer but decided not to go into debt to study in this field.  He had also convinced himself that he did not want to be a programmer. \n\n* He chose the community college path and dove into the work force, really enjoying it. \n\n* Josh later found that he did like coding after all, and as he started to learn he started to teach, which gave him confidence (even in interviews). \n\n* Listen to Josh's story about an interview process in which every interviewer had read some of his content (blog post or Pluralsight course). \n\n* Once you begin to develop public artifacts, they start to be your resume.  And these public artifacts gave Josh the confidence to redefine what he wanted to do in his career. \n\n* This gave him enough feedback to determine what is both valuable and interesting to him. \n\n* Are we all building the resume by producing public-facing content / a body of work? \n\n* Answering questions in communities is a great way to validate that you have something to share.  The Spiceworks community, for example, allows users to create [projects}(https://community.spiceworks.com/people/duffney/projects) attached to their profile. \n\n* \"You'll never go wrong by just adding value.\" - Josh Duffney \n\n* Looking back, Josh realized writing had always been part of his story since that first how-to in the Spiceworks community. \n\n* Every time Josh went to write something in Spiceworks (how-to, answer to a question, make a comment), he tried to add value.  Using this as a north star will guide you in creating public artifacts and determining if you should write them in the first place. \n\n* There is a slippery slope with self-promotion and marketing in the online content game, but keeping focus on adding value will ensure you don't stray too far. \n\n* Community Moderation - 20:47 \n\n* A common theme in Josh's career is that people have pushed him to do things.  While attending a [SpiceCorps](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps) meeting, someone who was stepping down from their role offered Josh the chance to become a moderator (to which Josh said yes).   \n\n* After a certain level of activity, these opportunities present themselves in different ways.  Josh was honored to be asked but really enjoyed that leading capacity. \n\n* At the beginning of your career, you say yes to everything to become successful.  In the middle and toward the end of your career you say no to almost everything.  Josh believes this advice came from [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/).   \n\n* Josh points to this as a form of leadership that was not management, which seems to be a common theme throughout his career. \n\n* Josh has never really wanted to manage people, but he does try to lead by sharing ideas or bringing people together. \n\n* This tendency along with the opportunities being made available to him explain how he fell into them. \n\n* Nick was reminded that he's been wanting to read Will Larson's [Staff Engineer](https://www.amazon.com/Staff-Engineer-Leadership-beyond-management/dp/1736417916) book. \n\n## 25:35 - Authoring Content for Pluralsight \n\n* Josh built courses for [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/).   \n\n* He started as a consumer of courses, but something happened at a local [PowerShell user group](https://www.meetup.com/topics/powershell/).  Josh ran into an instructor from a Pluralsight course he had taken.  He loved the instructor's approach to teaching and asked for advice. \n\n* At work, Josh had done some instruction to help colleagues.  He thought perhaps creating courses was a way to make some extra cash. \n\n* Josh originally asked about becoming a certified Microsoft instructor but was encouraged to become a Pluralsight author, which Josh initially dismissed. \n\n* Around this time [Adam Bertram](https://adamtheautomator.com/) came onto the scene. Josh watched some of Adam's courses and thought \"maybe I can do this.\"  He reached out to Adam for some guidance. \n\n* The process to audition was to record 5 minutes of yourself presenting and send it in for consideration.   \n\n* At the time, [Don Jones](https://donjones.com/) was the curriculum director.  Josh was somewhat star stuck about having to audition for Don and had to push past the feeling of impostor syndrome. \n\n* Josh ended up authoring a few different courses. \n\n* In the beginning, an author could define the course as they wished or choose from a catalog.  There are many more courses in the Pluralsight library now than 5 or so years ago when Josh got into it. \n\n* Pluralsight also has a better pulse on what their customer base need these days. \n\n* If you can fit into their catalog, it could be a great career boost as well as a nice monetary incentive. \n\n* This is a legitimate part-time job for the duration of your work authoring courses.  Josh said for his first course every minute recorded took an hour of prep and production work. \n\n* The instructor would also need to prepare all demo environments and any slides to use during the course.  Josh mentioned building the infrastructure as code environments for his courses were tremendous learning experiences. \n\n* There is a good technical team at Pluralsight to help check sound levels and ensure the highest quality content is produced. \n\n* The marketing burden for your course is relieved as Pluralsight would do it for you. \n\n## 30:20 - The Art of Sacrifice \n\n* After saying yes to everything, you eventually reach a point of not being able to sustain it all.   \n\n* Josh says 2021 has been a big lesson for him.  Knowing what you want most is important. \n\n* In many ways he has decided not to decide. \n\n* Is continuing what I am doing going to get me to the level of success that I want? \n\n* Josh has reached the goals he set when he was 20 for achieving by age 30 and has worked to redefined how he wants things to look at 40. \n\n* Certain things may have diminishing returns. \n\n* For Josh, to achieve a writing project goal he has, he will say no to all freelance work in the next 6-8 months. \n\n* In that one statement, he is deciding not to decide. \n\n* There were a number of Pluralsight courses that were in line with Josh's expertise and interest that he had to turn down because of this. \n\n* Find clarity by thinking deeply about what you really want.  This takes time. \n\n* Josh has taken the better part of a year thinking about what trade offs would be present switching to more of a writing role as opposed to an engineering role. \n\n* Sacrifices must be made to make room for other projects. \n\n* Nick references some advice from [High Performance Habits](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Habits-Extraordinary-People/dp/1401952852) by Brendon Burchard that sound similar to what Josh has done. \n\n* Find your primary field of interest (PFI), and then focus on creating prolific quality output (PQO) with a large percentage of your time, saying no to things outside the PFI. \n\n## 32:52 - Systems Administrator to DevOps Engineer \n\n* Josh saw this as a natural progression after starting with the help desk position we discussed earlier.   \n\n* After this he became a Systems Engineer and worked on SCCM, progressing to Senior Systems Engineer at a payments processing company focusing on Active Directory. \n\n* This was the first team Josh was a part of where everyone was a scripter in some way.  It allowed Josh to build his own solutions as a developer. \n\n* For example, Josh wrote scripts for Active Directory migrations and tracked all changes in a SQL database (leveraging this for reports to upper management as well). At one point he had a Microsoft consultant look at what he built over an 8 month period.  Josh was told a consulting firm likely would have charged half a million dollars or more to build a system like that for his company. \n\n* To build this system, Josh spent time after hours working on it, collaborated with peers in areas where he lacked skills, and read a number of helpful books.  \n\n* At the time, Josh was really interested in what it would require to take his coding at the next level without needing to move into a junior position as a software developer.  He wanted to deal with infrastructure and saw DevOps as that path which allowed him to walk the fine line between developer and engineer. \n\n* This allowed him to leverage previous experience in Systems Administration.  He had delved into CI / CD pipelines, [Desired State Configuration Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/overview/overview), worked with [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/) to roll out configuration management, and stumbled into Ansible. \n\n* There were eventually barriers beyond administration, and Josh had to read up on DevOps literature (gaining insight on process, culture, etc.). \n\n* Josh doesn't really see much of a difference between an IT Admin and a DevOps Engineer other than the way you carry out your work. \n\n* Josh has heard of teams working together in a Modern Ops fashion, but it depends on the organizational design. \n\n* Even traditional IT shops can bring in some DevOps practices to improve processes. \n\n* In Josh's first role as a DevOps Engineer, they were essentially release engineering until they started taking on more infrastructure tasks.  They acquired the Systems Administrators as part of the DevOps organization at that time. \n\n* Josh cites a good book called [Team Topologies](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology/dp/1942788819) that breaks down different team structures.   \n\n* Listen to Josh's description of the different topologies. \n\n* He feels the SRE model is an implementation of DevOps and gives some feedback on how he has seen SREs interact with various teams inside an organization. \n\n* When people ask Josh for feedback on DevOps Engineer roles, it is hard to do so without knowing the organization structure.  If the tech stack lines up maybe give it a try, but you likely cannot know the full picture until you join. \n\n* For Josh, the gateway to DevOps was infrastructure as code and cloud. \n\n* If interested in walking the path to DevOps, start with a programming / scripting language.  This creates a way for you to communicate with developers. \n\n* Also, you can use the same tools to manage your infrastructure automation as the developers do their code (Git, CI/CD pipelines \n\n* The Systems Administrator likely has a solid background in infrastructure.  Leverage it by learning how to automate it completely (i.e. server build to full configuration). \n\n* Getting to either immutable infrastructure or mutable infrastructure with config management would be Josh's first step toward the DevOps world. \n\n* Choosing a scripting language for success will likely rely on mental models.  Someone strong in Linux may choose not to dive into learning PowerShell first and may be more inclined to look at Python. \n\n* Listen to Josh's story about working for a company that was moving toward AWS and what he had to do to learn it based on his own mental models.  \n\n* Once you get a good foundation in a language, then focus on other tools like Ansible or Terraform.  Anything shoved into a cloud shell could be a good tool to target. \n\n* Some configuration management tools are falling in popularity because of the infrastructure they require. \n\n* \"Learn enough to practice.  Practice until you understand.\" - Josh Duffney \n\n* Josh came up with this out of necessity.  He thought he needed to master everything he picked up.  It's better to aim for competence first.  Then decide whether you want to pursue mastery. \n\n* Spend a significant amount of time on one area / one tool rather than a little bit of time on all.  There will be a significant amount of bleed over as you get into other areas. \n\n* Don't be afraid to become competent in other things after you've gone deep in one area.  You don't have to dive straight into mastery. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-124":{"title":"Episode 124","content":"\n# Episode 124\n\nWelcome to episode 124 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Josh Duffney and discuss .   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-03-2021 \n\n[Josh Duffney](https://duffney.io/) is a Content Developer for Microsoft.  He writes content on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/) and focuses on Ansible, Terraform, PowerShell, and Azure CLI.  Catch part 1 of our interview with him in [Episode 123](https://nerd-journey.com/just-add-value-with-josh-duffney-1-2). \n\nTopics – Stack Overflow, Writing a Book, Moving to Microsoft, Learning to Focus, Job vs. Career, Closing Thoughts [[Josh Duffney]] #Microsoft [[Episode 123]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:52 - Working at Stack Overflow \n\n* Josh worked for [[Tom Limoncelli]] at [[Stack Overflow]].  Tom authored [The Practice of System and Network Administration](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-System-Network-Administration-Admin-ebook/dp/B004JLMUJ0) and [Time Management for Systems Administrators](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Management-System-Administrators-Working-ebook/dp/B0026OR2WM). [[The Practice of System and Network Administration]] [[Time Management for Systems Administrators]]\n\n* Tom understood deep work and that engineers need time to focus. \n\n* It was impressive to see Tom's command line knowledge in action.  As a manager he was extremely technically savvy. \n\n* Josh is now moderately competent in [vim / vi](https://github.com/vim/vim). \n\n* As part of Stack Overflow, Josh no longer had to be a DevOps advocate.  It was built into the organization.   On Mondays he would join a stand up with the development team. \n\n* Josh had a front seat and insight into what software features were going to be released and why.  In other organizations, it might have taken years to even know the application's name. \n\n* Working for Tom was amazing, and it was a fantastic, extremely talented team. \n\n* Josh had been a user of the [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) platform but not much of a contributor before joining the company. \n\n* The people at the very top are still people, and they make mistakes.  Everyone on the team was extremely respectful and humble, being receptive to the ideas of anyone at any level. \n\n* Don't hold people in high positions up on a pedestal because you can attain that as well. \n\n## 6:36 - Writing a Book \n\n* Josh wrote [Become Ansible](https://becomeansible.com/) before joining Stack Overflow. [[Become Ansible]]\n\n* At the time he had no other outlet.  Pluralsight did not have room in their catalog for Ansible content at the time. \n\n* Previous to this, Josh experienced some health issues.  After recovering from them he did not dive back into community right away. \n\n* There was a two year period where he was dark from a community standpoint and dedicated himself to his job. \n\n* Josh had acquired a wealth of knowledge in bringing Ansible into a large organization that was mostly Windows.  There were some struggles to onboard the technology, and it did not seem like there was something in the market that captured this experience. \n\n* Josh felt like he needed to get the knowledge out of his head, and he had always wanted to write a book. \n\n* After speaking to others who had written a book and struggled to get it published, Josh listened to a great episode of the [Writer on the Side Podcast](https://www.writerontheside.com/) in which someone left Amazon to write their own book and self-publish. \n\n* That gave Josh the idea to self-publish. \n\n* Josh likes to publicly commit to goals to help hold himself accountable, and writing the book is one he followed through with. \n\n* Before starting to write he had a rough outline of some of the chapters. \n\n* To keep yourself on track when writing a book, begin with the end in mind, but you don't begin at the end. \n\n* Originally Josh had 8 chapters outlined and kept wanting to append as he wrote.  He eventually broke the book into two parts, outlined part 1 aggressively, and just started writing. \n\n* The time commitment was 1-3 hours per day (average of 1.5 hours daily, whatever he could squeeze in) for 6 months to finish the book (143 pages in total). \n\n* Josh continued writing after finishing the book and hit a streak of writing for over 240 consecutive days. \n\n* Josh loved the writing process and was extremely frustrated on many days.  Listen to the two extremes Josh uses to illustrate how it felt during the process. \n\n* It took about 20 pages to get past impostor syndrome.  And the amount of pre-sales dollars he made blew him away. \n\n* Near the end of the process, Josh had to make a hard choice to cut some chapters out of the book. \n\n* There were days when Josh would sit in front of his computer and start at a blank page, writing nothing because he was not sure how to say what he wanted to say. \n\n* Josh's writing process was singular to a large degree - outlining, writing, editing, and proofreading. \n\n* Josh is working to break these processes out now that he is in a full time writing position, realizing each requires a different type of attention.  This will allow him to scale. \n\n* This would allow different manuscripts to be in different phases concurrently because of the difference in mental power. \n\n* Josh's tag line for the book is written by an engineer for engineers…it's like shoulder surfing a co-worker. \n\n* Josh has plans to do a book update for a newer version of Ansible (to be released next year). \n\n* Josh's mentor gave him some advice on writing a book.  \"You write the book for you.\"  If it's the book you wish existed but does not, you should pursue it. \n\n* If you're doing it for the money or for the notoriety, it is going to be tough because of the lack of intrinsic motivation. \n\n* Writing a book for the technology industry can be a challenge. \n\n* If you are focused on bleeding edge technology, writing a book will be more challenging because of how quickly things change. \n\n* There is still some room to create more evergreen content.  Josh shares an example of something he did with his Ansible book. \n\n* Make sure the problem the book is solving is not just learning the technology (i.e. only a reference manual) but that it focuses on how the technology will benefit the reader. \n\n## 16:06 - Setting a Course for Microsoft \n\n* When Josh joined Stack Overflow, he released a blog called [Building a New Identity](https://duffney.io/building-a-new-identity/) and mentioned there was \"evidence of a writer\" within.  \n\n* During the previous year, Josh took Don Jones' Be the Master workshop to help take back his career. \n\n* Josh did work for [CloudSkills.io](https://cloudskills.io/), passed some certification exams, and wrote the book all in a very short time period. \n\n* While writing the book Josh ignited a passion for writing.  Previously he had never seen it as a full-time gig.  It became visible that he could potentially make writing a full-time gig. \n\n* Joining Stack Overflow was Josh's dream job and had been for the previous 7 years. \n\n* Josh had this locked in as his dream job as soon as [Steven Murawski](https://nerd-journey.com/a-career-journey-through-the-microsoft-ecosystem-with-steven-murawski-part-1/) was a SRE at Stack Overflow.  Josh was getting into Desired State Configuration much like Steven had in the process of becoming a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/).  [[Steven Murawski]] #SRE \n\n* Someone Josh knew from the PowerShell community reached out to Josh asking some questions about PowerShell and Ansible.  Then the person asked if Josh wanted to be a writer. \n\n* There was a position open at Microsoft in the same domain as Josh's book content.  Josh had applied for the same role about a year prior, but someone else got the job. \n\n* Josh decided to go ahead and apply.  The worst case would be having a difficult choice to make. \n\n* Josh was offered the job at Microsoft, and it was extremely difficult to walk away from a job that had been his dream for 7 years previous.  He chose to pursue writing. \n\n* Josh knew exactly how to leverage his expertise at Stack Overflow.  He knew the outputs needed to make him successful and when to ask others for help. \n\n* In the new role, learning the right outputs has been a struggle. \n\n* Is the metric just number of articles written per month?  Is that the right thing to measure to gauge impact?  Josh does not yet have the outputs pinned down. \n\n* Once you learn a little bit about writing, you realize how much instructional design exists.  There is a lot underneath the writing that makes it really good. \n\n* Great writers eliminate all knowledge barriers for readers, making the reader think learning is easy. \n\n* Josh has really enjoyed the change.  It has been a different pace of life for sure. \n\n* Now that things he was doing on the side have become his full time job, he's working to create new outlets in the area of nonfiction writing through a newsletter and a new book he is writing. \n\n* Though these endeavors exercise the same set of muscles, it is a different area of interest. \n\n* Josh has a 3-pronged approach to whatever he picks up: \n\n* It must benefit him professionally, personally, and creatively. \n\n* The nonfiction writing centers on what Josh has learned about [[digital minimalism]], mindfulness, productivity, and other topics that allow him to be a high output individual.   \n\n## 23:10 - Learning to Focus \n\n* Josh has embraced [[digital minimalism]] to avoid glass hamster wheel productivity and to focus on deep work. \n\n* One way to get started is to limit your cell phone. \n\n* Josh already looks at a screen for a couple of hours of his own creative endeavors followed by a full work day. \n\n* This has been a 3-year journey for Josh and extremely tough.  * Just last month, he got rid of his smart phone for a light phone / dumb phone. \n\n* Just having the ability to use a smart phone was enough to pull Josh away from being present and mindful. \n\n* Try to limit your time and use of e-mail and instant messaging to get some breathing room during the day. \n\n* When he was younger, Josh remembers having the time to enjoy blissful boredom in which he was unhurried and unhindered.  Finding those moments will restore you and make you even better. \n\n* Josh recommends trying a 30-day technology fast, whether it's a full digital declutter like [[Cal Newport]] recommends or maybe just a break from social media. \n\n* Right now he's doing a \"respond on Friday\" trial.  Throughout the week he will still post to social media but won't be actively reading it until a specific time slot on Fridays. \n\n* You will be amazed at how much more calm, peaceful, and relaxed you will be if you can unplug for a bit. \n\n* Nick shares an anecdote of staying at an AirBnB close to home and getting outside your normal. \n\n## 27:32 - [[Job vs. Career]] \n\n* The job is what you do 8-10 hours per day, but your career is always progressing and is going to ensure you have a job. \n\n* The blogs, courses, etc. that Josh created turned into his resume. [[MOC - Show Your Work for Job Excellence]]\n\n* An employer is not your success coach in defining what you learn and do.  Have a pulse on the industry and a path forward. \n\n* The daily grind will eventually weigh you down and wear you out. \n\n* Josh found that through his creative outlets he could bring the learnings to his team and revitalize them. \n\n* Despite long weeks with an incredible amount of off hours calls, Josh recounts continuing his learning and bringing what he learned to his teammates.  It brought a beacon of hope back into the team. \n\n* Josh has lost sight of this in the past, which is the reason behind writing the post [You're an Engineer Be an Engineer](https://duffney.io/youre-an-engineer-be-an-engineer/). \n\n* The outside hobby / creative outlet keeps you passionate about your job and the industry you work in. \n\n* Josh likes to front load a lot of mental thrashing. \n\n* When his mind gets too overwhelmed Josh will take a sheet of paper with 3 columns (exercise taken from [The Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) and empty his mind - do, should do, want to do. [[The Bullet Journal]]\n\n* In looking to the future, Josh uses his interests and the pattern of what fuels him - learn, understand, teach, and share (all of which meshes well with writing). \n\n* Sometimes it is as simple as sitting on the couch in his home office and allowing time to think through and figure out what he wants.   \n\n* For example, Josh had the idea for the aforementioned nonfiction writing (covering deep work and [[digital minimalism]]) before he wrote his Ansible book.  He struggled with it and didn't just want to rehash a couple of Cal Newport books. \n\n* Josh realized great writers have a newsletter.  The next actionable step for him was to start one.  He has started and failed 7 different newsletters to this point. \n\n* He decided to call the first one Tuesday's thoughts and wrote whatever he wanted each Tuesday. \n\n* After about 3 weeks he ran out of gas (took too long, didn't know what to write, ran out of time) and stopped. \n\n* Josh thought his topics were too career focused and wanted the next one to be more centered on deep work and called it the Four Hour Engineer based on learnings from [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/).  [[Tem Ferris]]\n\n* He ended up feeling like this one had too narrow of a focus and pulled the plug on the newsletter. \n\n* Fast forward to now.  Josh has a newsletter called [[The Knowledge Worker]].  He's left off all the qualifiers and decided to write on a weekly basis.  It's been one thought, one quote, and one action applicable to what Josh is thinking about or struggling with on a weekly basis…in 300 words or less.   \n\n* This one has been really successful.  He has been able to cover a broad spectrum of ideas with this newsletter and is using it as a way to write about what he is learning, which goes full circle back to [Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/).  Josh would write about what he was doing so he better understood it and in a way that it added value to people.    #Spiceworks \n\n* Josh needed to take that lesson and plant it in the realm of nonfiction instead of in the technical sphere \n\n* From a process standpoint, Josh starts with the north star of being a writer and deducts all the way down to what he can do right now to start the journey. \n\n* Other successful people Josh has spoken with said their newsletters got the attention of publishers. \n\n* Josh decided to start doing a newsletter and start iterating this into something he can sustain.  Once it is sustainable, the goal is optimization to the point of the least amount of friction. \n\n* Josh highly recommends others read [Own Your Tech Career](https://www.manning.com/books/own-your-tech-career) by [[Don Jones]].  It didn't give him any answers but rather the right questions to ask himself. [[Own Your Tech Career]]\n\n* [The One Thing](https://www.amazon.com/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776) is a great read (not focused on tech) but takes more creativity to apply the lessons within due to its generality. [[The One Thing]]\n\n* Ideally get a framework for how you will define success, but be patient and give yourself time. \n\n* Josh's accomplishments in the last 2 years have been through constant iteration.  As soon as he identified what he wanted he went and got it and then iterated again. \n\n* Find something that gives you a framework for making decision, and then give yourself the freedom to think.   \n\n* Give yourself room to determine what really interests you, and lean into it in a relaxed way.  See how far it takes you. \n\n* Ideally, find work that feels like play. \n\n* This reminds Nick of a Jack and Suzy Welch book - [The Real-Life MBA](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Life-MBA-Winning-Building-Growing/dp/0062362801) [[Jack Welch]] [[Suzy Welch]] [[The Real-Life MBA]]\n\n## 37:28 - Closing Thoughts \n\n* The best and most frustrating advice Josh has received is stay the course (i.e. keep doing what you are doing). \n\n* Josh likes to get feedback on ways he can improve and what he is doing right. \n\n* By encouraging you to stay the course, people are really suggesting that you are headed in a great direction and not to change anything.  Take some comfort in this. \n\n* Be careful about bleed over of other people's experiences into what you want to do. \n\n* Someone else's negative experience in an area does not guarantee your experience will be the same.  Conduct low risk experiments in the area to determine if something is actually worth doing (i.e. write a blog post instead of writing a book to test the waters, etc.). \n\n* Nick tosses out some book recommendations in the end comments: \n\n* [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) by [[Cal Newport]] [[Deep Work]] \n\n* Thanks again to [Kelly Schroeder](https://nerd-journey.com/path-to-management-and-hard-resume-lessons-with-kelly-schroeder-pt-1/) to the recommendation to have Josh on the show.  Contact us if you want to recommend a topic or a guest! [[Kelly Schroeder]]\n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-125":{"title":"Episode 125","content":"\n# Episode 125\n\nWelcome to episode 125 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Tom Hollingsworth in which he shares how his Networking specialty came to be, the journey to a major certification and beyond, and some advice for those looking to get into Networking.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-01-2021 \n\nTopics – Birth of a Specialty, CCIE and Beyond, Advice for Those New to Networking \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:06 - Meet Tom Hollingsworth \n\n* [Tom Hollingsworth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/networkingnerd/) has been the [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/) event lead for about 8 years as part of his role at [Gestalt IT](https://gestaltit.com/) after serving as a Network Engineer for many years. [[Tom Hollingsworth]] [[Tech Field Day]] [[Gestalt IT]]  #CCIE\n\n* Tom's handle in communities is [Networking Nerd](https://networkingnerd.net/) due to his deep expertise in Networking.  Nick points out that he chose [NetworkNerd](https://community.spiceworks.com/people/networknerd) because it sounded fun. \n\n* Tom gets contacted from time to time because people think he is a master of social networking.   \n\n## 3:34 - Birth of a Specialty \n\n* Tom spent about 6 months on the phone supporting Gateway computers but knew the role would not last. \n\n* He did some contract work and then found a position that was junior level help desk and did a lot of work with schools. \n\n* This allowed Tom to gain a variety experience with different technologies and grow his career at the same time. \n\n* The company was only about 40 people, and the team on which Tom worked had only about 8 people, each with their own specialty.  Tom's specialty was in networking. \n\n* The networking specialty came from the last month on the phones at Gateway (around the 2002 - 2003 time frame when dial up was still popular). \n\n* Listen to Tom describe how he would have to fix [AOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL) for someone. \n\n* In the last month of his time at Gateway he started getting calls about cable modems, which was pretty new to him.  He was able to search online for some ideas but would otherwise have to direct the caller to contact their internet service provider. \n\n* At the time, Tom suspected there had to be something to networking at which he needed to take a hard look. \n\n* When ramping for this new role, most of what they did was server based.  Tom had to learn some other technologies but noticed there was really a need to fill a networking void. \n\n* A mentor at work walked Tom through Cisco router troubleshooting but said Tom would have to learn it and to go buy a book. \n\n* This was a time when the best way to learn was from technology books.   \n\n* Tom knew he had learned quite a bit when Barnes and Noble didn’t have the books he needed any longer. \n\n* He had to buy [Routing TCP/IP, Volume 1](https://www.amazon.com/Routing-TCP-IP-1-2nd/dp/1587052024)  by Jeff Doyle and several others. \n\n* In the late 2000s, online forums picked up speed and aligned with Tom's expertise gains.  He was able to jump into a forum and get help on specific problems instead of just reading a book. \n\n* Tom remembers watching [War Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames) and seeing what the main character could do on a computer.  Then at one point Tom could do that too. \n\n* What you may excel at may not be something your company is really looking for. \n\n* At first, Tom needed to know a little bit about everything in his job. \n\n* As he progressed, the networks the company deployed became more complicated (or more feature rich). \n\n* Tom was eventually asked to work on phone systems as well. \n\n* Some of the work Tom did was out of necessity for the company, but there was a whole other side of networking he kept up with at the same time. \n\n## 11:31 - Achieving CCIE and Beyond \n\n* The company had to balance the work coming in with what it would cost to pay for Tom to get certified. \n\n* After Tom got certified his company was able to bid for a project that required they have a [CCIE](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccie-enterprise-infrastructure.html) on staff and eventually became proud that they had someone on staff with those credentials. \n\n* There are generally fewer [paper tigers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-paper-tigers/) who hold the CCIE due to its practical lab component. \n\n* Tom passed the CCIE in 2011 and is currently on the CCIE Advisory Board. \n\n* The test is two parts - a written portion and a practical lab portion.  It used to be you could take the written portion every 2 years to keep your certification status. \n\n* Listen to Tom share some details of the [recertification policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/recertification-policy.html). \n\n* Tom buy a lot of used hardware on eBay to help study for the certification and create his own lab to simulate the exam. \n\n* Listen to some of the limitations of what he could do with the gear he had compared to what is available now with some of Cisco's emulation software (which runs a large portion of the lab now). \n\n* It's nice to train on the exact same thing you will be seeing when you take the exam. \n\n* At one time there was a rack of gear in the room where CCIEs went to take the exam. \n\n* Listen to what some exam candidates did to try and get exam proctors to give away information. \n\n* Several years ago Tom was asked by the program manager within Cisco to take part in the advisory board mostly because he wrote a blog post on the exam based on some community feedback he had heard that prompted an in person meeting to discuss it. \n\n* The program manager at Cisco wanted Tom to work with them to make the exam better. \n\n* Tom and a number of others in the community debate changes to the exam and value to the greater community. \n\n* Many of the changes to the exam in the last 2 years have been very well debated by the advisory board as it relates to community value. \n\n* Tom gives examples of things that were not as valuable like a CCIE for OpenFlow. \n\n* The CCIE doesn't move without a good reason because it does not follow trends.  It sets trends. \n\n* Getting a CCIE is like getting a PhD.  You're adding to the body of knowledge in a field.  You don't just say you want to do it to be the best.   \n\n* In any certification program, you have to want to understand things at a deeper level. \n\n* Most of the jobs of the average operations team does will not go beyond the [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna-routing-switching.html)+. \n\n* Tom gives an anecdote about knowing [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) and its applicability to his job role. \n\n* If your job is 95% basic tasks, this is not something you can work on through job training. \n\n* If you are not willing to put in the time to study each day and do the work, it may not be for you. \n\n* You almost have to be obsessed with it, the type of attachment that makes you want to work on it when you're sitting there not doing anything else. \n\n* You have to know the technology at a deep level and understand every possible outcome so you can determine the best path forward when it comes time to take the exam. \n\n* Once you dive in you will realize how much time it takes to get to that level of understanding. \n\n* Nick compares this to [[Scott Lowe]]'s concept of the [full stack engineer](https://packetpushers.net/series/full-stack-journey/).  [[Full Stack Engineer]]\n\n* Listen to Tom talk about a boot camp he attended which provided some pretty outlandish tasks and the reasons behind making attendees do them. \n\n* High level technology certifications like CCIE, VCDX, or other are really testing you on what happens when someone throws a curve ball at you. \n\n* Tom gives some great examples of how this might happen on the CCIE exam, how one might think through them, and how this simulates what working in a real environment is like. \n\n* Anyone can type in a command they found in a book or online.  But when that command wrecks something and you have to come back from it, that is the learning experience. \n\n* Nick recounts plugging both ends of the same cable into a switch and taking part of the network down, and Tom shares an experience in troubleshooting a similar situation that he never forgot. \n\n* When possible, Tom liked to let a junior level person noodle through a problem on their own before offering any help for the benefit of the learning experience. \n\n* You have to think beyond what the book says, beyond what the internet says the problem is.  Think about all the scenarios and eliminate them one at a time, even if they seem crazy at first. \n\n## 28:58 - Advice for Those New to Networking \n\n* Learning a scripting language if you're going to be in the Networking field is important. \n\n* Listen to Tom's analogy of mechanics needing to know how combustion engines work and the tools they need today. \n\n* Learning a language like Python is helpful, but if you're automating VLANs, you still have to know what a VLAN is (the basics). \n\n* Take the fundamentals and start to orchestrate based on the basics you understand (i.e. automatically bounce a switch port that errors).  You will still need to be able to do root cause analysis for something that was automated. \n\n* Tom has a nice analogy here about a backhoe and a shovel. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-126":{"title":"Episode 126","content":"\n# Episode 126\n\nWelcome to episode 126 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

Moving to Tech Field Day \n\n* Tom spent years studying for the CCIE.  He failed it 6 times and passed on the 7 attempts.  Around attempt 4 he started documenting things. \n\n* Tom came across some great blogs by [Ethan Banks](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-042-ethan-banks-and-the-journey-to-career-self-awareness/) (a previous guest) about the CCIE.  [[Ethan Banks]]\n\n* Tom then created his own blog to parallel what others were doing.  As he started being more active in writing and on social media, he was contacted by [Stephen Foskett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sfoskett/) about participating in [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/).  [[Stephen Foskett]]\n\n* This involved flying to California and learn about tech companies. \n\n* Tom kept being invited back to these events. \n\n* Around this same time, Tom was at an inflection point in his career and felt like he either needed to breakthrough and do something more or walk away. \n\n* Foskett offered Tom a job, referring to it as [The Dread Pirate Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht).  Tom would be completely nontechnical in what he did. \n\n* Foskett basically hired a CCIE to buy airline tickets for people and edit video, and Tom agreed he wanted to do it.  That was June 1, 2013 (Tom's first day at Tech Field Day). \n\n* Tom spent the first 1.5 years doing a lot of administrative tasks related to the events. \n\n* At one point Stephen and Tom split the workload down the middle, with Tom running point on Networking and Wireless events and Stephen taking care of the rest. \n\n* The growth pattern here was getting involved in the community, recognizing what the community needed, getting recognized for that work, and then coming on board at Tech Field Day and growing into it. \n\n* There are some in the greater community who feel certain tasks are beneath them. \n\n* When Tom started he was the 3rd employee of the company.  There was no area for him to oversee.  He was one of the people doing the work, and it did not matter what it was. \n\n* \"Don't be the person that says no because something is beneath you because nothing should be beneath you.\" - Tom Hollingsworth \n\n* Listen to Tom's experience as manager of operations in a food service environment and how he used to give his employees breaks, showing them the work was not beneath him. \n\n* The reason you say no to something should be better than \"I don't think that is worth of my attention or talent.\" \n\n* It took Tom a long time to realize it, but [[servant leadership]] is something he has embodied for his entire life. \n\n* It is important for a leader to get down in the trenches with employees to do the work. \n\n* Other managers who have been guests have stated their role is to remove roadblocks for employees. \n\n* Tom used to \"tank\" angry customers, standing in front of that person so his employees could work and asking people to shout / get angry at him instead of his employees. \n\n* It was important to allow the employees to work and resolve the issue.  Then the analysis about who might be at fault can be done. \n\n* Good managers let us know when we have messed up but defend us to their managers. \n\n* \"I'm doing this because I know you can be better…and if that means taking heat for you from someone else who doesn't get it, that's what my role as a manager / supervisor should be.\" - Tom Hollingsworth \n\n* In a way, Tom acts as a manager for Tech Field Day.  As event lead, it is his job to make sure everything happens as it is supposed to happen (presenters show up on time, live stream goes up on time, etc.). \n\n* Capable, intelligent people who know how to motivate others to get things done can make good managers.  Real managers will recognize that quality and encourage these folks to take a leadership role. \n\n* Recognizing that you are in over your head is something Tom wishes he had learned a long time ago. \n\n* Instead of making things up, ask yourself if this is a decision you need to be making.  If there is doubt, run it by someone else. \n\n* Tom gives an analogy from the military, speaking to how sergeants and others in charge can likely do your job better than you but really excel at getting you to do your job better. \n\n* Listen to the George Washington story Tom shares as part of this. \n\n## 17:41 - A Different Kind of Technical \n\n* Tom says he transitioned to a different kind of technical role rather than a less technical one and speaks to the difference between architect and engineer. \n\n* The architect knows how all the pieces work together.   \n\n* Tom gets to use both his architecture knowledge and his engineering knowledge when trying to evaluate some of the technical presentations for Tech Field Day. \n\n* There are many firms that employ analysts (Gartner, Forester, etc.). \n\n* The job is to take what a company tells you about their technology and give it a critical eye.   \n\n* As an analyst, you may not implement the solutions, but you get to hear about all the different vendor solutions.  Cisco is different than Juniper which is different from another vendor. \n\n* You have to understand the commonalities and the differences (almost like a logic problem). \n\n* If there were no analysts, SD-WAN would never have taken off. \n\n* Basically they put an opinion or flavor on a technology to help people understand why it is important and valuable. \n\n* This role involves a LOT of writing. \n\n* Tom really likes to write and to explain how things work, but it requires a very deep understanding of the technology. \n\n* Those starting out in their career haven't built the body of knowledge for use in picking out patterns and trends that industry veterans have and would not be good analysts. \n\n* Tom's experience in networking helped him be a better event lead, and his experience as an event lead helps him be a better analyst. \n\n* He understand the business drivers that make the technology work as well as the technology drivers. \n\n## 26:03 - The Mission of Tech Field Day \n\n* Tom told Stephen in the beginning that he is a horrible salesperson. \n\n* He tells potential customers how awesome Tech Field Day is and expects them to pay money to be part of it, and he's not going to chase them. \n\n* Some companies don't quite understand the value of what Tech Field Day brings. \n\n* For a company to participate, they have to get something out of it (an exchange of value for the cost).  Is the video produced a valuable enough resource, the coverage from amateur analysts, etc.? \n\n* Some companies want to pay for lead generation, but that isn't the goal of Tech Field Day.  Tom and Stephen like to let the technology speak for itself. \n\n* This is different from scanning someone's badge at a trade show booth. \n\n* Attendees of Tech Field Day (those in the live audience for events) are called delegates.  They represent peers in the tech community who aren't going to be able to make it in the room.  \n\n* There are 3 qualifications to be a delegate. \n\n* You must be an independent technical influencer (cannot work for a company that makes stuff - VMware, Dell, or other).  The intention is to avoid all perception of a biased viewpoint. \n\n* You must be technical, have some industry experience, and be willing to learn. \n\n* You must be an influencer of some kind (a platform of some kind like a blog, podcast, video series - an audience). \n\n* Previous guests [Jon Hildebrand](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-038-jon-hildebrand-and-recovering-from-a-layoff/) and [Keiran Shelden](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-046-career-advancement-keiran-shelden-pt-1/) shared with us how attending Tech Field Day elevated their careers. [[Jon Hildebrand]] [[Keiran Shelden]]\n\n* There's no writing requirement for delegates.  That would be like assigning a book report. \n\n* It's the genuine writings that get produced as a result of attending Tech Field Day that are the most helpful (and what vendors who present really want).   \n\n* There are times where people write about what companies are doing and what could be done to make it better (very much like an analyst). \n\n* Nick equates Tech Field Day to an [advocacy program](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-036-customer-advocacy-programs/). \n\n* Tom says it's more like being a trusted advisor.  A trusted advisor is someone who walks into a Sales meeting and guards the customer against buying something they don't need. \n\n* Nick believes you can still be consultative even if you could be perceived as being biased based on where you work. \n\n* This goes hand in hand with checking your ego at the door.  You have to look at things critically and not just with rose colored glasses. \n\n* There are ways for someone on the inside to present a fair analysis of something.   \n\n* \"Is it perfect?  No  Will it work?  Yes, with these caveats.  If you're ok with that, we can make it work for you.\" - Tom Hollingsworth \n\n* Too often the person in this conversation is more concerned about hitting a sales goal than helping the customer. \n\n* Nick says we can all benefit from [Josh Duffney]((https://nerd-journey.com/just-add-value-with-josh-duffney-1-2)'s advice of just adding value. [[Josh Duffney]]\n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-127":{"title":"Episode 127","content":"\n# Episode 127\n\nWelcome to episode 127 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share the 3rd and final part of our interview with Tom Hollingsworth.  We'll share ways to determine if you're burned out or on the brink, ideas to help recover, and how to set goals so you can avoid burning out. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-01-2021 \n\n[Tom Hollingsworth](https://twitter.com/NetworkingNerd) has been the [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/) event lead for about 8 years as part of his role at [Gestalt IT](https://gestaltit.com/) after serving as a Network Engineer for many years.  Catch part 1 and 2 of our interview with him in [Episode 125](https://nerd-journey.com/the-gateway-to-networking-mastery-with-tom-hollingsworth-1-3) and [Episode 126](https://nerd-journey.com/a-different-kind-of-technical-with-tom-hollingsworth-2-3/) \n\nTopics – Signs of Burnout, Grinding Away to Nothing, Closing Thoughts [[Tom Hollingsworth]] [[Tech Field Day]] [[Gestalt IT]] [[Episode 125]] [[Episode 126]] #Burnout \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:11 - Signs of Burnout \n\n* Tom wrote some very good blogs recently on burnout. \n\n* [Racing on the Edge of Burnout](https://networkingnerd.net/2021/04/23/racing-on-the-edge-of-burnout/) \n\n* [The Double-Edged Grindstone](https://networkingnerd.net/2021/01/29/the-double-edged-grindstone/) \n\n* Tom thinks his career change was motivated by burnout and at times felt like he was rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. \n\n* It seemed like resellers were slowly getting pushed out of the picture with companies wanting to sell direct or only rely on large partners. \n\n* \"When you are hitting the ceiling and it feels like the walls are closing in on you, that's burnout.\" - Tom Hollingsworth \n\n* We all have times when we don't want to work on something, but getting to that point daily, it's a sign. \n\n* Burnout isn't always when you don't care anymore.  Burnout can be when you don't think anyone else does.  When you feel like no one else recognizes your efforts or something you put your heart and soul into, you are there. \n\n* This means you have put more effort into something than perhaps you should have and that you are running your engine in overdrive. \n\n* In the last year, we are more burned out than we are willing to admit. \n\n* It's the stuff on your to-do list that keeps getting pushed down that you never get to that starts to eat at you. \n\n* How many times have we been dragged into a task that hit us out of nowhere and had to be completed that day? \n\n* Tom used to write whenever he wanted, but for the past month he has been putting it off. \n\n* Pretty soon getting to something later means it's been on your list for 5 months. \n\n* People can get to the point where they throw their hands up and walk away from everything (and quit).  But the burn out will follow them. \n\n* The physical toll on someone can be high blood pressure, lack of sleep, etc. \n\n* \"The human body is a wonderful machine.  You can run it in overdrive until it falls apart.  And you will never know until something happens that you don't get to walk away from.\" - Tom Hollingsworth \n\n* Nick references [High Performance Habits](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Habits-Extraordinary-People/dp/1401952852) and the chapter on energy. [[High Performance Habits]]\n\n* Pressure and expectation makes it hard on people pleasers, especially saying no. \n\n* Tom has learned to tell people he can’t help them right now.  A couple of years ago he would just say yes and add the one more thing to his plate…which can lead to burnout. \n\n* Think of Atlas with the world on his shoulders.  Every extra thing steals your time, energy, and attention. \n\n* If your distractions take all of your energy over your priorities, your distractions are your priorities. \n\n* Tom likes to go for a run in the morning to build energy and get his mind right to start the day, and he definitely notices when he misses a run. \n\n* Taking time to relax allows you to work on yourself.  If you run out of energy because you are burned out, you are no good to anyone. \n\n* You can tell when people are not firing on all cylinders. \n\n* Think of taking care of yourself as billable hours for you and not for your employer. \n\n* It's hard to recognize your own burnout.  Tom has friends who keep him in check when they see the signs.  Not everyone has this. \n\n* The first instinct we have when things get tough is push everything we can away, including those who would be able to recognize our situation. \n\n* If someone tells you there is a problem, LISTEN!  They probably do see something. \n\n* Maybe you are distracted when you are supposed to be relaxing.   \n\n* You don't have to agree with someone when they give you feedback, but you should still listen.  They are trying to point out something abnormal. \n\n* Everyone has a level of pressure under which they can work.  We all reach a point where we can't handle it any longer.  Have someone in your life who can recognize when you've almost reached that point and can help you stop before the last feather falls. \n\n* Sometimes stepping away is what we need, even if we feel like we don't have the time. \n\n* Accept intervention from others as a gift that is to help save you from yourself. \n\n* Nick shares an anecdote about being low on energy and trying to record an intro for the podcast compared to when he approached it fully rested. \n\n* Getting rid of that nagging feeling \n\n* When studying for the CCIE, Tom would put his kids to bed and then fire up his lab.  He knew it was time to go to bed when the Late, Late Show came on CBS (which means 4 hours of lab work had passed). \n\n* Once Tom passed the exam, he felt unsettled in the evenings.  It was a nagging feeling that he should be working in his lab and practicing. \n\n* You have to acknowledge the fact that your brain is talking to you, but you don't have to agree with it. \n\n* If you need to do something that feels productive but helps with self care, download a coloring book or PDF coloring sheet and do some coloring.  It is therapeutic and solves the voice problem (the voice telling you that you're not doing anything). \n\n* Tom is active in the Boy Scouts with his son and goes camping quite often. \n\n* He can apply the things he is good at in a different way (the organizing and overseeing).   \n\n* He gives the example of spending some time cooking and having a conversation with others about an upcoming trip. \n\n* These types of activities are valuable and can help recharge your battery. \n\n* The other day Tom was told by his boss that he did not take enough vacation,  He does take vacation, but he takes it in a slightly different way.  People at work don't understand how being involved in Boy Scouts recharges his batteries (i.e. it isn't sitting on a beach). \n\n* You have to find the things that are fun for you. \n\n* If you're taking time to recharge from burnout, listen to yourself (not the voice chastising yourself for being unproductive but the one that allows you to take time for yourself). \n\n## 23:25 - Grinding Away to Nothing \n\n* It is very easy for people to just keep going.  We can’t see ourselves when we're going too far. \n\n* If you set a goal for yourself to write 1000 words per day for 30 days, you will have written 30,000 words in a month.  That's a book.  It's important not to write 10,000 words on day 1 and leave yourself with nothing else to do. \n\n* Set manageable, achievable goals for consistency's sake. \n\n* It's very easy when working out, for example, to decide to do just a little more. \n\n* There is nothing wrong with doing your workout each day or even stopping short of a distance goal. \n\n* If you don't set a goal with an achievable end, you will always push yourself past it.   \n\n* Pushing farther than the finish line works in the short term, but beware grinding away to nothing. \n\n* Hit the target and feel accomplished.  Reward yourself with some downtime. \n\n* What would happen if you just kept increasing the distance you ran each day but eventually reached the point where your body needed to rest? \n\n* It's easy to set goals that are constantly escalating.  Eventually you will hit the point of \"I can't do this anymore.\" \n\n* Then you don't stop and reflect.  You stop and chastise yourself for missing the mark. \n\n* We do not stop and examine what we have been doing. \n\n* A stretch goal should be like a rubber band.  Stretch it every once in a while but not to the point of breaking the rubber band. \n\n* Pick a day here and there to work on the stretch goal. \n\n* Do it often enough that it feels like a special occasion and pushes you past boundaries but not so often that it adds stress. \n\n* Tom liked writing blog posts, but when he had to write 8 per week he did not love it as much as he used to. \n\n* Work is the thing you do all the time that doesn't feel fun anymore. \n\n* You have to find little ways to keep the work fun. \n\n## 30:36 - What's Next and Closing Thoughts \n\n* One of the nice things about technology is that it changes so much. \n\n* How different would his career have been if he had a phone at the beginning to look up information? \n\n* The jobs he used to do really don't exist any longer.  Tom can whine about things that no longer exist or look for things that now interest him. \n\n* If he does the latter he can eliminate what does not interest him (like being a storage analyst). \n\n* As hard as saying no is, fear of missing out is even harder.  We need to say no and be ok with not being a part of something and not dwell on it.  \n\n* Listen to Tom's story about the time he went repelling and how he decided it was not for him.  \n\n* If you have a visceral reaction to something long enough, that is your brain trying to tell you to stop doing that thing. \n\n* The best career advice Tom ever got was when someone told him he needed to always be in a mode where he was learning things. \n\n* If you are not someone who wants to crack open a book, investigate a technology, or dig deeper into something you will have a rough time in the tech industry.  If you have learned all there is to know, you will find yourself obsolete very fast. \n\n* The worst career advice was \"it's magic.  It will figure itself out.\" \n\n* Nothing is magic!  Magic happens because dedicated people put their effort into making things work.  It may look like magic to you because you didn't do it. \n\n* Understand that all magic is just other people working really hard to make something special happens. \n\n* Nick tosses out some of John White's previous advice. \n\n* Successful people are not super successful.  They are just really good at picking themselves up after every failure, and they are stubborn. \n\n* If you know you can get something, keep working at it.  Eventually it will look like magic. \n\n* The magic isn't pulling the rabbit out of the hat.  It's doing the work to put the rabbit in the hat in the first place and carrying it carefully so the rabbit doesn't hop out. \n\n* The easiest way to follow up with Tom is on Twitter.  His handle is [@NetworkingNerd](https://twitter.com/NetworkingNerd).  And his Batman job is as a vendor vigilante, writing blogs at [networkingnerd.net](https://networkingnerd.net).  You can also follow Tom at his Bruce Wayne job (the one that pays the bills) at [Gestalt IT](https://gestaltit.com/) or [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/). \n\n* Check out [Nick's blog post](https://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2021/06/05/giving-past-burnout/) inspired by this conversation with Tom. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-128":{"title":"Episode 128","content":"\n# Episode 128\n\nWelcome to episode 128 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we discuss John's return as co-host, his experience buying a home and moving, and Nick's experience flying solo.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-01-2021 \n\nTopics – Stress of Home Buying, Taking a Break and Flying Solo, and Lessons Learned [[Home Buying]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 1:00 - John is Back! \n\n* John and his wife were told by their land lord and the homeowners that they wanted to sell the home in which they were living, forcing John and his wife to move pretty quickly. \n\n* This caused a big time crunch, and recording is what gave. \n\n## 2:21 - Stress of Home Buying \n\n* The process of finding a house was pretty difficult.  COVID is still with us, and there are certain restrictions involved in seeing houses, how long you can look around, many people looking for houses and fewer looking to move, etc. \n\n* In California at present, you get a 30 minute appointment to look around a house, the realtor has to be present, and you have to sign a great deal of paperwork. \n\n* The agent gets a key code for the door and walks around the house with you. \n\n* Only one interested party at a time can be inside the home at a time. \n\n* The house hunting process was mostly on weekends, but toward the end of 60 days they looked hard at renting again.  Their real estate agent found them a place, and John and his wife had an offer accepted. \n\n* They then went through the 30-day closing / lone approval period and had 2 weeks to move. \n\n* The last 2 week was when things kicked into high gear. \n\n* This process was easier due to the fact that John and his wife were renting and did not need to sell a place before they could buy something (i.e. contingency sale).  This was a complication on the place John and his wife ended up finding. \n\n* Any house John and his wife wanted to see required 24 hour notice to the home owners for a showing. \n\n* One of the things that worked to their advantage was the 30-day loan closing process and then the 2 weeks to move out of the rental. \n\n* This 30-day period was when the packing process had to take place.   \n\n* John took a break but definitely missed it.   He was able to let it go to focus on what was needed. \n\n* John recommends not moving in a hot housing market during a global pandemic.  \n\n* On the topic of career, John was fortunate enough to have a manager who understood. \n\n* The manager emphasized that John take time off to move effectively and communicate what he needed.  The sales rep John works with was extremely supportive as well.  \n\n* John felt supported by everyone, including Nick. \n\n## 12:45 - Taking a Break and Flying Solo \n\n* Nick remembers the day John told him he needed to take a break.  He didn't want to offend John but thought the podcast needed to keep going. \n\n* The motivations for both of us have always been finding things that could help others.  It was never about being featured on something.  \n\n* John was afraid the podcast would altogether stop and was surprised but excited Nick wanted to try to keep it going.  \n\n* John had edited all 112 episodes up to the point where he took a break. \n\n* Nick was ok with not knowing how to edit.  He would do the notes and pass them to John but never really took the time to learn editing. \n\n* Nick told John to take 30 minutes to tell him everything he needed to know so he could try to figure out the rest.  Luckily, John had documented the process. \n\n* Part of our jobs as SEs is to take knowledge and disseminate to others.  John felt like he had digested down everything he had learned. \n\n* This was an iterative process, and teaching it to someone else cements some things that are unconscious in your own process. \n\n* Nick didn't even have Audacity downloaded to his computer or know how to normalize audio levels.  He told John he would try not to bother him but may have a question here and there (answer when time allows). \n\n* Something weird happens when you go from just show notes to editing.  You start to hear more than you did before (more filler words, more silences, when people talk over each other - almost like they are louder). \n\n* John says you start to notice when people talk over each other during an interview because it is work for you after the fact. \n\n* The listening with a critical ear part is a different kind of listening. \n\n* There is something about trying to speak and listen with a critical ear at the same time.  You have to practice. \n\n* Nick compares this to the process of [circular breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_breathing). \n\n* Nick thinks he was making more edits because he was hearing more things but learned a TON in this process. \n\n* Hopefully if you have listened to episodes starting with 113 it was decent and was helpful. \n\n* John was super happy we had content to release.   \n\n* Listen as John describes the intricacies of the first episodes Nick edited. \n\n* Nick says it's really different when you're the interviewer and don't have a co-host.  There's no one else to bounce ideas off except your guest. \n\n* The key is to make any lulls in conversation sound natural.  It takes practice to ask questions the right way. It's a skill that takes practice to build. \n\n* We have an outline of how we want the show to go, but sometimes we go down a totally different path we never expected.   \n\n* This is John's favorite part.  Much of what we hear from a guest we are hearing for the first time.  We may have a general idea of what they want to say, but we're pulling more details out of it (career inflection points, etc.). \n\n* When you take on extra work, it can have different impacts in your life.  Nick knew this would be slow. \n\n* Then [Josh Duffney](https://nerd-journey.com/just-add-value-with-josh-duffney-1-2/) recommended Nick read [Give and Take](https://www.amazon.com/Give-Take-Helping-Others-Success/dp/0143124986) by [[Adam Grant]]. [[Josh Duffney]] [[Give and Take]] \n\n* Nick was doing this to help John and the listeners.  Though it was extra work, he didn't care.  It gave him energy actually even though he questioned whether this would be a sustainable process. \n\n* There was no burnout due to the extra workload. \n\n* John speaks to the full podcast process and the logistics of the work involved.  We've had gaps in releases even with both of us involved.   \n\n## 27:38 - Lessons Learned \n\n* John \n\n* Hire movers if you can. \n\n* Pack over a period of time instead of all at once. \n\n* Every move is a chance to purge what you do not need.  Maybe that should extend to your existence in general (question whether you need stuff). \n\n* Draw the same analogy to career when you are taking a new job.  Look at the tools you have and whether they need to be purged. \n\n* Nick \n\n* When doing a collaborative project, make sure you understand the full workstream.  Nick learned a ton because he was forced to do so. \n\n* It seems like we've had decent audio.  John has listened to other podcasts and picked up on the fact that someone has never edited (hear variable volumes, extreme max and min volumes, etc.). \n\n* Nick says you learn so much from hearing people share their stories, and you get to listen to it multiple times.  This is how we remember the previous episodes so well. \n\n* John says 99% of show notes have been done by Nick, and he feels like there are people who consume the notes without listening to the audio.   \n\n* There are podcasts John likes to consume by show notes.  It can be a faster way to answer a question.  With time codes in the notes we allow people to listen to a specific section of the conversation. \n\n* If you interact with our podcast in a non-traditional way, let us know if the show notes do / do not benefit you.  Leave a comment, smash the subscribe button, or DM us. \n\n* Listen to John's fun ideas for new mediums for our content. \n\n* If you have a career story that needs to be told, we want to hear from you! \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-129":{"title":"Episode 129","content":"\n# Episode 129\n\nWelcome to episode 129 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Jon Towles in which we talk through his journey into the mobility field and his challenges and openness with ADHD.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-08-2021 \n\nTopics – Working for Blackberry, Sharing Your Work, ADHD Challenges and Openness [[Jon Towles]] [[ADHD]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:30 - Meet Jon Towles \n\n* [Jon Towles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jontowles/) started in IT around the age of 29 and has been through many places in the mobility industry.  He now works in the IT wing of his wife's company, working with different clients on unified endpoint management related to iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. \n\n* Jon didn't really want to be in IT.  He grew up nerdy and a bit of a gamer.   \n\n* Jon was in retail for a long time.  After meeting his wife, she helped him refocus, encouraging him to get out of retail.   \n\n* In the process he got healthier, achieved an A+ certification, and landed a job working for Blackberry. \n\n* This team of peers were very experienced (some had been Principal Engineers at Microsoft, for example). \n\n* Jon's ADHD gave him the energy to work harder than anyone else to make up for his initial lack of experience. \n\n* That 5-6 year stint of extreme effort got him to the point to where he can understand just about anything in technology now. \n\n## 6:34 - Working for Blackberry \n\n* The last retail job Jon had was at Verizon (back at the time when Verizon first got the iPhone - 2009). \n\n* John was teaching customers how to use Blackberries, sold Blackberry training, and during that time worked to get his A+. \n\n* It's hard to get someone to give you a shot in IT with no experience. \n\n* Additionally, being overweight made landing new opportunities a challenge.  Jon has had a significantly easier time after getting down to 200 lbs. (previously 300 lbs.). \n\n* In IT you need to get that one person to give you a shot and take advantage of it. \n\n* A company called On Demand Communications hired Jon to do Blackberry administration.  The company had some financial issues, and he transitioned to contract work. \n\n* After one contract job he applied at Blackberry and was fortunate enough to get hired. \n\n* Everything in Jon's life is about effort.  He loves to mentor people, and if they show effort, he will do whatever he has to in order to help that person be successful.  \n\n* If you have the right mindset, even if inexperienced, you can be very good. \n\n* Mobility is one of the few things in IT that you cannot learn about in school (no formalized program). \n\n* John makes the point that there is not really a Sysadmin degree. \n\n* Jon believes having a bachelor's degree is good but is not necessarily a requirement in IT and that there may be diminishing returns in higher level degrees. \n\n* The last book Jon read for enjoyment was from [The Dark Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(series)) series. \n\n* Jon wrote about how his brain works in [this article](https://mobile-jon.com/2021/05/23/surviving-the-politics-of-it-as-an-architect-with-adhd/). \n\n* Much of IT was descended from telecom.  Jon did a stint there too (telecom expense management). \n\n* The Blackberry job was in Texas.  Jon is from New England, and it was a challenge to get people to understand him. \n\n* One of the things Jon took from being at Blackberry was to own things.  Say you don't know the answer and that you will get back to the person. \n\n* He came into the role with soft skills and an aptitude for writing. \n\n* Jon really enjoyed documenting his work.  When closing a help desk ticket, for example, if no knowledge base article existed, Jon had to write one. \n\n* Jon would spend hours digging through documentation and figuring out how things work.   \n\n* Listen to the ways he built troubleshooting skills in the absence of repositories for logging like Splunk. \n\n* During this time, Jon started taking his ADHD more seriously. \n\n* It takes twice as much effort or more for someone with ADHD to do intensive reading (of logs or other things to troubleshoot a problem) and can be extremely draining. \n\n* Jon was falling asleep at the wheel on the drive home and started taking Ritalin to help him stay awake. \n\n* He is inquisitive and likes to understand how things work. \n\n## 18:28 - Sharing Your Work \n\n* In regard to documentation, Jon has run into people who did not want to share their work.  When you document and share information, you inevitably benefit everyone. \n\n* It should be more important to think about what is good for your company and not what is good for you. \n\n* Nick shared that when he worked in a manufacturing environment, certain individuals were very guarded about sharing what they knew with others (almost like a fear that others might get promoted faster, etc. if they had the same information). \n\n* John says we often times attach a judgement to this (having knowledge that others in the organization do not). \n\n* 3 types of people in IT \n\n* People good with people / good with end users \n\n* People who are technically strong \n\n* People who pretend they are technically strong and can fool the people who are good with people but not the ones who are technically strong \n\n* If you put in the work and are willing to put in the time you can get to anywhere you want to be.  There are not a lot of people who are willing to do it.  Jon prefers to do what it takes to do things the right way. \n\n* John says we need to consider someone's interest in a topic.  John can still power through something related to his job, but if he had no interest in something that was totally orthogonal to what he cared about, it would be orders of magnitude more difficult.   \n\n* Jon has a need to make others happy, and he likes all kinds of technology.  He loves to solve problems and puzzles, much like Sherlock Holmes. \n\n* Jon likes to use [his blog](https://mobile-jon.com/) and document things that were poorly documented elsewhere (i.e. figuring it out and presenting to others to help them). \n\n* He's developed a deep expertise with the [Unified Access Gateway](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Unified-Access-Gateway/index.html) and [Secure E-mail Gateway](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workspace-ONE-UEM/services/WS1-Secure-Email-Gateway/GUID-AWT-INTRO-SEG.html) components from VMware. \n\n* When new products come out, they may not always be ready.  Jon uses that opportunity to figure out the new technology offering. \n\n* Jon has received messages from people stating his blog helped them get into mobility. \n\n## 26:05 - Challenges with ADHD \n\n* The problem with ADHD is the amount of time spent in internal dialogue. \n\n* You re-analyze past conversations frequently. \n\n* A potential new symptom of ADHD (Jon recently read) is having highs and lows of how you deal with emotions.  Sometimes this causes an under or overreaction to a situation. \n\n* Jon spends a lot of time thinking about what he may have done wrong in a disagreement with someone else. \n\n* There may be a bias others have toward folks with ADHD.  They may think you are crass or something, but people may not understand how hard it is to have no filter. \n\n* There are people who cannot even work with others because ADHD symptoms are so bad. \n\n* John says ADHD may get lumped together with being on the autism spectrum, and the two are not the same. \n\n* The word neuroatypical covers both, and what it indicates is working differently. \n\n* Jon had a director who essentially told him his ADHD was holding him back and that he was smart enough to fix it.  It's so condescending. \n\n* Many managers do not know their people have ADHD, but Jon owns it. \n\n* Jon knows there will be good days and bad days. \n\n* People don't understand the struggle. \n\n* The difference between ADHD and being toxic is that in the case of ADHD, there is no malcontent.  People may not understand this. \n\n* Jon had one manager who got it named Dan Smith, perhaps the sweetest guy Jon has ever met.  He was a good advocate for Jon and acted as a translation engine. \n\n* Jon didn't know he had ADHD until age 29, and he was tested at age 8. \n\n* Jon found some old papers of his mom's later in life that said he had been diagnosed with ADHD when he was younger.  This was back in the 80s when parents were not comfortable putting their kids on Ritalin. \n\n* It's like the [infinity gauntlet](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Gauntlet) in the Avengers movies.  Can we harness a person's powers for good, or do we write them off? \n\n* If you know how to harness the strengths of someone with ADHD (i.e. their energy, for example), you can have someone who is as good if not better than everyone else. \n\n* It blows Jon's mind how others may not want to play someone to their strengths. \n\n* What we're talking about is a prejudice against a mental health diagnosis and a misunderstanding of what the medication (Ritalin) does to help (a stimulate will calm someone with ADHD but isn't a tranquilizer). \n\n* The worst part about ADHD is that it makes you forget whether you took your medication that morning. \n\n## 34:41 - Path to Being Open about ADHD \n\n* Jon wrote some great blog posts about living with ADHD that we highly recommend reading: \n\n* [Surviving the Politics of IT as an Architect with ADHD](https://mobile-jon.com/2021/05/23/surviving-the-politics-of-it-as-an-architect-with-adhd/) \n\n* [LFG: Trying to Find the Right Manager in IT with ADHD](https://mobile-jon.com/2021/06/01/lfg-trying-to-find-the-right-manager-in-it-with-adhd/) \n\n* Jon and his wife own a pharma company.  He realized it was mental health awareness month and chose to start writing. \n\n* It always surprises him when someone reads his blog and it actually matters to them. \n\n* During Jon's first trip to attend VMworld, he was asked if he had a blog.  At that time the answer was no, but it made him think about writing. \n\n* Technical writing had always helped him learn better (i.e. being hands on).  He's not able to memorize things that well, especially for things like certification exams. \n\n* After a presentation he gave at VMworld 2018, people shared how impactful his blog had been to them. \n\n* Jon had a moment of clarity last month and realized what he is doing actually matters.  Perhaps it was his responsibility to really make a difference and be an advocate for ADHD during mental health awareness month. \n\n* Jon started in mobility, and many in this field get no respect, especially with mobility getting grouped together with VDI. \n\n* Jon doesn't care what people think. \n\n* Jon felt he could really make a difference and decided to talk about the struggles he has seen, things he has dealt with, and what he has done about it. \n\n* Jon owns the ADHD.  If he makes mistakes he will own them, believing that his work will speak for him. \n\n* Jon needs to ensure his work is great.  If it isn't, people will use his interpersonal struggles against him at every turn. \n\n* Jon doesn't always understand when someone has stopped talking and may accidentally talk over them. \n\n* He is straightforward and blunt and also Catholic.  Jon will often times feel bad after the fact and try to help people understand it was not to be malicious. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-13":{"title":"Episode 13","content":"\n# Episode 13\n\nThe Sniper Approach to Job Hunting with Tom Delicati \n\nTopic -

In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Jon Towles in which we discuss support and advocacy for neurodiversity and some tips for pursuing a career in mobility.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-08-2021 \n\n[Jon Towles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jontowles/) started in IT around the age of 29 and has been through many places in the mobility industry.  He's also become an advocate for neurodiversity.  Catch part 1 of our interview with him in [Episode 129](https://nerd-journey.com/the-challenges-of-a-superpower-with-jon-towles-1-2). \n\nTopics – Advocacy and Support for Neurodiversity, Mobility Career Path, Closing Thoughts [[Jon Towles]] [[ADHD]] [[Neurodiversity]] [[Episode 129]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:22 - Transparency, Understanding, and Advocacy \n\n*  Jon is up front with potential employers about his ADHD but shares the strengths of having it with the employer (high output, for example). \n\n* People usually don't believe how productive Jon can be. \n\n* Take whatever it is that is you, own it, be comfortable in your own skin, and use that to create a strategic advantage. \n\n* You're going to mess up, but the good should outweigh the bad. \n\n* Jon spends so much time trying to eliminate symptoms.  Listen to the stories of his struggle in meetings. \n\n* Those who know Jon know exactly what he is. \n\n* He likes to ask questions and try to understand why people think something I is a good idea, even if it is a bad idea.   \n\n* Jon used to sit on architecture review boards and would research technology he hadn't previously heard about.  He wants to understand how something works from the device to the back end. \n\n* Blanket statements like \"it doesn't work\" make Jon want to see the logs so he can understand what is happening. \n\n* If John shares his diagnosis with an interviewer or hiring manager and they are not good with it, he would not want to be at that company. \n\n* He prefers to be transparent. \n\n* Listen to Jon's story about being at MIT and the lack of transparency from others. \n\n* In the context of technology capabilities, if you choose to trust someone without testing on your own and something goes wrong, it's on you because you decided to trust that person. \n\n* One of Jon's favorite things to do on calls with vendor technical support is to ask why, but this question seems to upset people. \n\n* Nick shares some insight from a training he attended on asking why vs. how or what and the impact on the hearer's defensiveness. \n\n* If you find someone with the right mind, even if they are inexperienced, you can really develop them. \n\n* Jon gives the analogy of watching [The Good Doctor](https://abc.com/shows/the-good-doctor).  The protagonist can visualize everything needed when performing surgery. \n\n* Jon feels like he goes through a similar process to make sense of other people's ideas. \n\n* Being good at what you do and honest about the things you know and don't know helps build trust with those who lean on you for help. \n\n* John makes the point we're really talking about learning and teaching as evidence of having learned something.  Explaining the why behind our reasoning helps others understand how we conduct the troubleshooting process en route to problem solving. \n\n* Jon says the biggest fight he and a good friend had is because the friend wanted Jon to give him the answer to something instead of being shown how it works. \n\n* \"I don't want to do the work for you.  I want you to actually understand how it works.\" - Jon Towles \n\n* Jon loves teaching people, helping to develop them, and helping them grow skills. \n\n* There is no one more synonymous with Workspace ONE than Jon, and he has written an article every week this year. \n\n* Jon loves the idea of building people up and adding to their lives.  People in mobility are often treated very poorly. \n\n* Jon feels it is his job to advocate for these people.  If he doesn't maybe no one else will. \n\n* Jon feels he was given an opportunity at Blackberry he didn't deserve but that he took and used to grow into what he is today. \n\n* He's had a number of fights with people trying to advocate for people who work in mobility.  He wants them to get opportunities. \n\n* Many people in mobility have such low self esteem from a technology perspective. \n\n* Jon wants to lift them up as much as he can through his blog, even going so far as to encourage people in the industry to schedule 15 minutes with him to talk through problems. \n\n* Jon is working to start an IT ADHD support group to try to help people. \n\n* When Jon was at a financial company, he was told to stop wearing Airwatch shirts because people believe all you are is an Airwatch guy.   \n\n* A lot of these people (those in mobility) had potential at some point, but you can get broken. \n\n## 16:46 - Managerial Support for ADHD \n\n* A big misnomer is that people with ADHD are not mentally strong. \n\n* As a result, managers may not understand them.  These people are often placed in situations where they cannot succeed. \n\n* More than anything, we (those with ADHD) need a filter - someone who will protect us, advocate for us, and let us be who we are. \n\n* No one quits a manager more than someone with ADHD.  Someone with ADHD needs the right manager. \n\n* We need that person who will let us be who we are and support us on the journey. \n\n* You don't get it until you've had that person who supports you.  Probably 90% of those who need it have not had it. \n\n* Jon says in any interview it is about working stuff in organically. \n\n* Due to owning a company with his wife, Jon generally does not take on other full time work. \n\n* At a certain point in your career you shift toward looking at culture and others things of that nature. \n\n* Jon looks at culture and really feeling out his boss.  An interview is two-way and not just one-way.  You are interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you. \n\n* Jon thinks interviewing a future manager is like speed dating.  If you don't click with the person you are about to go work for, why take the job? \n\n* John mentions we've advocated for being in the driver's seat in these discussions and whenever possible, looking for a job when you already have one. \n\n* COVID opened up the opportunity for remote work and working with companies we might not otherwise have had the chance to work with because of our location. \n\n* Many companies had to do what Jon calls the COVID shuffle - being forced to implement a work from home strategy when it otherwise may not have existed. \n\n* Millennials have opened a lot of doors for all of us, endorsing the idea of meritocracy. \n\n* John says the consumerization of IT is driven in many ways by this younger generation.  If a company cannot deliver IT services onto mobile phones, for example, they could struggle to attract and retain talent. \n\n* He's received a laptop instead of a desktop at his last 3 companies by default. \n\n* Jon shares a story about getting his wife an extremely high powered desktop for work use, which is immune to a chip shortage. \n\n## 24:01 - The Career of a Mobility Engineer \n\n* Jon wrote a great blog called [The Life of a Mobility Engineer](https://mobile-jon.com/2018/02/04/the-life-of-a-mobility-engineer/), highlighting 3 different roles in the mobility career path. \n\n* Usually you get into mobile (perhaps transitioning over from help desk) and start to manage and enroll devices. \n\n* You start as the administrator, doing enrollments and other tasks. \n\n* People at Jon's level throughout his career have had very little appreciation for the help desk, but he always appreciated it. \n\n* Jon started as a Blackberry administrator.  After working for Blackberry, he transitioned into an engineer. \n\n* The job of the engineer is to manage the back end servers and do deployments, etc. \n\n* Eventually Jon grew into an architect.  He came up with ideas that made a difference, ideas that were really good. \n\n* When Jon was at Wellington Management, he was brought in to see what he could do.  The environment was kind of a mess, and Jon took the environment into an Airwatch dedicated SaaS environment that was much cleaner and ran well. \n\n* At this point Jon was able to hire a developer and affect app development, advocating for native mobile app development. \n\n* Jon took an app they were using and modernized it into something called Picture Book.  He tied it into their learning management system (or LMS), showing where people sat, showing conference room availability, building in everything cool in iOS 9. \n\n* Listen to all the capabilities Jon describes that this app provided. \n\n* Jon started to grow into an architect and was really focused on solutioning. \n\n* Becoming an architect is similar to the moment when Neo (from [The Matrix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/)) really starts to believe. \n\n* Most people in the mobility space are just engineers even if they say they are architects.  When you are an architect you understand how the technology works and how you can use it. \n\n* The greatest thing about mobility is that it is pliable.  It allows opportunity to engineer ideas, understanding how the technology will fix something or deliver on a need. \n\n* Jon speaks to a product called Ground Control that allowed moving between mobile device platforms as well as AirLift, calling them innovations you wouldn't think would be possible. \n\n* One thing Jon has worked on over the last couple of years is learning REST APIs. \n\n* Listen to the story of a tool he developed to create a capability that didn't previously exist. \n\n* The architect role is an elevation of who you are and a growth into another person. \n\n* John says the engineer executes on a design and the architect is the designer. \n\n* The architect should not be a theoretical physicist who doesn't touch anything. \n\n* Just because we think it works does not mean it will.  Vendor documentation isn't always great.  Try it out for yourself. \n\n## 34:12 - Career Advice and Closing Thoughts \n\n* The best advice Jon ever received was from one of his top 2 or 3 bosses.  It doesn't matter what you do but how you do it.   \n\n* Jon has come to learn some people do not care about this, but he still believes it.  It really depends on where you work as to whether the \"how\" is valued. \n\n* This advice has followed Jon throughout his career.  Doing things the right way and being inclusive of others is sound advice. \n\n* You also have to be true to who you are.  Don't try to pretend you are something else or fake your way through it.  Be who you are.   \n\n* If you're always who you are, you can be comfortable in your own skin. \n\n* It is unfortunate that more mental illnesses are not respected as disabilities. \n\n* The company Jon and his wife own is a disability owned business.  They do a lot of outreach. \n\n* It terrifies Jon that some people with ADHD can't even work with others.  People don't see it as a big deal, and you basically get punished for it. \n\n* We hope eventually people will see it is not necessarily a bad thing to have ADHD. \n\n* Jon can put his head in the sand or say it can be good too.  You can't just take the good and pretend the bad does not exist.  Others may want to focus on the bad and use it against you or not give you credit for the great you have done. \n\n* When you're really good at what you do, certain people are always looking for ways to take you down a peg. \n\n* It seems to be human nature in IT. \n\n* We will all have days when we do something dumb.  \n\n* This makes John think of organizational culture.  Is your organization's culture about prizing perfection or collaboration and growth of the people within the organization? \n\n* People love to say the word, but are they exemplifying the word? \n\n* Are companies putting their money where their mouth is when it comes to diversity?  Is it to check a box or to really be better? \n\n* The job of a manager is to put people in a position where they can succeed and helping to build a new skillset the individual needs to grow. \n\n* You can hire talent or build it by investing in employee development.  You can't have it both ways. \n\n* This is a reminder that Jon is starting a support group for those with ADHD.   \n\n* It is intended to be a safe space to talk about struggles.  Your partner / spouse may not understand your struggles like someone else going through similar struggles does. \n\n* Reach out directly at [jon@mobile-jon.com](mailto:jon@mobile-jon.com) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/m0bilej0n) \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-131":{"title":"Episode 131","content":"\n# Episode 131\n\nWelcome to episode 131 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share Jonathan Frappier's early career story from teaching college courses and the application of that experience in the technology field which led him all the way to a job at EMC.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-16-2021 \n\nTopics – Educator to Technologist, Blogging and Giving Back, Small to Big Organizations, Landing at EMC \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:19 - Meet Jonathan Frappier \n\n* [Jonathan Frappier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanfrappier/) has been in technology for about 20 years and at present is focused on supporting applications that are customer facing and for internal teams running on AWS. [[Jonathan Frappier]] #HashiCorp \n\n* Jonathan took some programming courses in college but found it was not for him.  During his sophomore year, he started to wonder what else he could do in technology, eventually landing in Systems Administration. \n\n* Jonathan did some teaching while working toward his Masters degree (around 2007). \n\n* Interestingly enough, Jonathan decided to begin his resume's experience timeline at this point but recently ran into \"you're too senior for this role\" from hiring managers.    \n\n* He cut off 7-8 years of early career experience, which allowed him to get his current job. \n\n* One of Jonathan's first jobs was at CompUSA, which might have been one of the most valuable of his career.  When there is gatekeeping in an interview process, you start to see what a hiring manager might see as a red flag. \n\n* Listen to ways Jonathan used these situations to tweak his resume accordingly, making him look \"younger.\" \n\n* The same concepts from previous experience can apply to any other job. \n\n* Jonathan was teaching some CIS and entry level computer classes.  The desire stemmed from having some really good and really bad teachers in college, driving an interest in giving back and helping people. \n\n* His first chance to teach was a class on Microsoft Office that had students of various backgrounds (not in computer science). \n\n* Jonathan was passionate about being a good teacher for others, encouraging students not to leave his class.  Listen to his story of encouraging a paralegal to stay the course, helping the student to understand the importance of learning the material. \n\n## 9:54 - Technologists as Educators \n\n* A large part of our role as technologists is educating other people on why we are doing things, why we ask users to use password managers, etc.   \n\n* To be successful, you must be able to communicate that technical information back to the business so they support what we are doing to keep the company running, to keep it secure, etc. \n\n* You do the best you can at any point in time, and you just keep on trying to teach people. \n\n* This is about meeting the person where they are. \n\n* Jonathan's role at CompUSA taught him to be able ask questions of people to gauge their understanding.   \n\n* Do we start with geek specs or solitaire and Microsoft Works? \n\n* He might interact with 40-50 people per day, talking with some who understood technical components deeply and some who were buying their first computer. \n\n* Changing levels of complexity with an audience is helpful, whether calibrating up or down.  John states that management may not care about the technology but how it solves business issues. \n\n* Jonathan says CFOs may not care about RAM in a server but would like to know they can make it through busy system usage times without downtime.   \n\n* Jonathan does not feel the school he was at really prepared him for the real world being a programmer.  He didn't walk out of school with the ability to walk into a company and program anything. \n\n* Jonathan struggled for a couple of years with what he wanted to do, and the .com boom helped him transition out of retail and into a help desk job. \n\n* Jonathan shared that he had no formal teaching / tutoring experience before starting to do it while working toward his Masters. \n\n## 16:44 - Small Organizations to Big \n\n* Jonathan applied to be a web developer and was instead offered a role working the help desk. \n\n* The company was small with 4-5 people in the IT department.  Jonathan was fortunate to get exposed to many products and technologies because of this (networking, support for implementing a new process based on business requirements gathering, etc.). \n\n* He had very supportive co-workers and a manager who enabled him to learn. \n\n* Jonathan retained the knowledge gained in various areas and came to appreciate the intricacies of different types of technology jobs. \n\n* Each member of the small team had to pitch in on various tasks as there were no dedicated teams for networking, storage, etc. \n\n* A friend of Jonathan's from the CompUSA days had started to work on technology certifications like the MCSE, and Jonathan, involved in a migration from Windows NT 4 to Active Directory, began to study for and achieved his own certification. \n\n* If you don't like to learn and want to be told only specific steps to do your job each day, technology is probably going to be a struggle for you.  Technology continues to change. \n\n* Listen to the trends in virtualization Jonathan describes to illustrate the changing landscape. \n\n* There are advantages to starting off in a small environment from a technology exposure standpoint, but Jonathan found larger organizations didn't feel he was deep enough in certain areas to join a large team with a specific specialty. \n\n* It was a challenge to break into the larger organizations as a result. \n\n* John makes the point this may be shortsighted on the part of organizations.  He uses the illustration of terminating Cat 5 tables to speak to this. \n\n* Jonathan remembers when he was interviewing for the job he has now and being asked the number of files in a Linux directory. \n\n* For some reason, this came up often and did not seem like a true measure of whether he could do the job.  In fact it seemed like an obscure question. \n\n* We got on a little bit of a rant about the implications of this question. \n\n* Should we always be developing a specialty even though someone is a generalist? \n\n* It can't hurt to go deep in an area or two.  This could allow you to walk into a number of companies and market your talents.  \n\n* Jonathan gives the example of knowing Cisco switching very well. \n\n* Jonathan would tell hiring managers he was not a walking [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/).  They were ok with it, but it was the technical interviewers that kept pressing on specific commands. \n\n## 31:35 - #Blogging and [[Giving Back]] \n\n* John cites blogging as a way for him to cache things like this (commands to solve problems that came up here and there but that he wouldn't remember how to solve the next time it happened). \n\n* Jonathan struggled for a while trying to figure out how to give back outside the formal classroom.   \n\n* Forums in the early 2000s were good places to get answers, but Jonathan didn't get too involved, not wanting to regurgitate what someone else shared as an answer. \n\n* When blogging started to take off, this was a way for Jonathan to give back to others based on what he was trying to learn and to help him write better documentation. \n\n* Reviewing a blog post at a later time allowed him to see how his writing could be improved and where the gaps were. \n\n* Writing was a medium through which he could teach and connect with other people.  It's something you have to work on to improve and came become tedious.  Each post he wrote helped him improve the next. \n\n* At first blogging was a hobby.  Then Jonathan started getting paid to write posts, and it felt like a job.  Once it began to feel like work, he got away from doing it as a hobby. \n\n*It was a good run for a couple of years and opened some doors.  Jonathan feels it helped him get into bigger companies like EMC despite not having worked at a company of over 500 employees.  Writing was a component of this new role. \n\n* This built a portfolio of work people could not ignore.  The writing examples helped Jonathan get into that next job. \n\n* Writing can also be a way to make a shift into learning a new technology.  Blogging shows new experience you have gained and can be leveraged in an interview. \n\n## 39:16 - Landing at EMC \n\n* When Jonathan joined EMC he was active in blogging and was able to continue doing it for his first couple of years there.  What he was blogging about was ancillary to his job function at EMC, and the two played off one another. #EMC\n\n* Listen to the examples Jonathan shares of the interplay between work and the topics for his blog. \n\n* EMC helped Jonathan bring together bits and pieces of project management concepts (collecting requirements, understanding the audience, etc.) to develop the right content for courses. \n\n* Jonathan and his team was writing the labs and the training but also had to maintain a very large computing environment. \n\n* They pushed the limits of nested virtualization with ESXi, and it was the largest server environment Jonathan had maintained to that point. \n\n* Even though he was focused on training, there was enough hands on work to maintain the labs so Jonathan did not lose his technical edge. \n\n* Listen to the long term effects of being on call that it took Jonathan a while to get over once he moved over to EMC and no longer had to be on call. \n\n* Jonathan was contacted by a recruiter for this role at EMC.  The day they contacted him he had just accepted a job as a SE for another company but deep down knew he wanted to break into a large company like EMC. \n\n* Jonathan communicated his situation to the recruiter, and they sped up and changed the process just for him. \n\n* He sat through all the interviews with EMC before his two weeks notice expired, and he had an offer the day he interviewed.   \n\n* The environment Jonathan was coming out of was similar to what they would be using at EMC.  It seemed like he had all the right keywords. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-132":{"title":"Episode 132","content":"\n# Episode 132\n\nWelcome to episode 132 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share Jonathan Frappier's story of being part of the vBrownBag crew, recognizing he was headed toward burnout, and the methodology for stepping back to focus on what was important.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-16-2021 \n\n[Jonathan Frappier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanfrappier/) has been in technology for about 20 years and at present is focused on supporting applications that are customer facing and for internal teams running on AWS.  Check out part 1 of the interview with him in [Episode 131](https://nerd-journey.com/technologists-as-educators-with-jonathan-frappier-1-2/). \n\nTopics – Joining vBrownBag, A Step Back, Burnout, Giving Something Up, Learning and Applying Scrum [[Jonathan Frappier]] #HashiCorp [[Episode 131]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:07 - Joining vBrownBag \n\n* Jonathan got involved in [vBrownBag](https://vbrownbag.com/) at one point. #vBrownBag\n\n* It is somewhere between a webinar and an informal learning platform. \n\n* Participating was partially for learning something new but also for increasing exposure gaining the skills to get that next job. \n\n* The vBrownBag really started as an informal study group.  Each person would take a topic and present back to the group. \n\n* The content from vBrownBag was extremely helpful to Jonathan when studying for his [VCP-DCV](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vcp-dcv.html). \n\n* Cody Bunch (a founder of vBrownBag) sent out a call for help, and with Jonathan using the content to study already, he decided to participate, starting with video editing and posting vBrownBag content to YouTube. \n\n* This kind of experience could be made to whatever Jonathan wanted it to be and allowed him to gain speaking experience. \n\n* After they finished the VCP series of broadcasts, the vBrownBag team had to figure out what to do next, so they polled their audience and co-workers for some ideas.  DevOps was top of mind as one example of the next thing people needed to learn. \n\n* Now the breadth of the vBrownBag topics is massive. \n\n* Nick thought maybe vBrownBag propelled Jonathan into the role at EMC, but that is not quite right. \n\n* When Jonathan first started at EMC, he was still in the background at vBrowBag and had not hosted a show or done a presentation. \n\n* One of the things Jonathan did not plan on at EMC and did not come up in interviews is that he and his teammates had to teach the courseware and labs they put together. \n\n* Jonathan was nervous after finding this out, but getting through the first couple of classes and being able to answer questions from highly technical people helped him get gain confidence.   \n\n* As a result he was more willing to participate in the public facing aspects of vBrownBag (hosting shows, presenting, asking questions). \n\n* This led Jonathan to presenting at VMworld and other user group meetings. \n\n* Nick mentioned this is building career capital and part of that body of work. \n\n* Jonathan's manager at EMC was supportive of the team and helped them through their inexperience, iterating through different courses and labs to build the right content. \n\n* Some courses had to be rushed out and were built only on product videos because the team could not get their hands on the software / hardware to tinker in time.  \n\n* In some cases the courses were for customers (paid training) and in others it was training internal teams. \n\n## 11:32 - A Step Back \n\n* Jonathan was wrapping up his work with vBrownBag around the time he was leaving Dell EMC in 2017 - 2018. \n\n* Jonathan knew he was burned out but did not know why, so he started peeling things back. #Burnout \n\n* Blogging was fun for a while until he accidentally turned it into a business and stopped enjoying it. \n\n* vBrownBag was fun and helped him meet a lot of people, helping what he was doing at EMC as well.   \n\n* Being so similar to what he was doing at work made it feel like work. \n\n* He was not sure where he was losing his passion for technology. \n\n* The blog was backed up and archived on GitHub. \n\n* After not feeling any better, he chose not to go to any conferences one year. \n\n* Even after stopping participation in vBrownBag, he didn't feel better. \n\n* Burnout is a tricky thing to overcome, so he kept peeling things back until there were very few extracurricular tech things left. \n\n* The home lab was powered off and kept in the closet. \n\n* At that point it was just work left, and he needed to find some other activities. \n\n* Some people get to the point of having to relocate to try and help, but that wasn't quite the case for Jonathan. \n\n* Jonathan's daughter came to the rescue.  She came home one day stating she wanted to learn how to snowboard.  After some lessons, she wanted her parents to do it with her. \n\n* Over the next couple of years Jonathan and his wife learned how to snowboard, and Jonathan has found he is happier in the winter when he has time to hit the slopes. \n\n* It's great to find something outside work that recharges you.  The snowboarding was good timing. \n\n* Especially in the last year, many have been stuck at home in front of a screen to do everything.  It's important now to find something that helps you maintain balance. \n\n* How do you decide when to add something back? \n\n* It comes in waves for Jonathan.  He shares the exchanges with Nick about being on the show which caught him on the way up. \n\n* Jonathan is figuring out, like surfing, how to see the wave coming without having it knock him over.  Using some natural energy so that the body / brain / emotions can help you ride the wave is important. \n\n* You need to be able to look out for how you're feeling at a given moment. \n\n* If you're beaten down, know to look up because there is going to be a wave coming through that will pick you up and give you energy to do something new or something you once enjoyed. \n\n* We don't need to try to ride every wave.  Some waves you can let pass you by.  The skill of catching the wave and riding it is one thing, but we don't want a wave crashing on it. \n\n* Having awareness of going through the waves allows you to pick yourself up and come out of it. \n\n* Jonathan thinks his wife might have noticed he was headed toward burnout. \n\n* It became a constant dread of not wanting to do whatever he had to do (scheduling the next month of vBrownBag, getting on a plane to travel, presenting at a VMUG etc.). \n\n* Everything didn't feel great at that point.  It tipped Jonathan off to the fact that burnout was here or coming. \n\n## 21:49 - Giving up Something You Once Enjoyed \n\n* There was a TedX talk called \"The Magic of not Giving a F\\*\\*\\*\\*\" and a book on it by Sarah Knight.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwRzjFQa_Og  [[The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a Fck]]\n\n* Search for it on a non-work computer if you want to find it (contents are explicit). \n\n* Emotionally there is only so much we have to give, kind of like a budget.   \n\n* With technology allowing us to be connected and reachable just about any time, we seem to have forgotten it is perfectly ok to say \"no thanks, I don't want to do that.\"  You're not being mean by saying no thank you; you can be polite and say it.  You may not want to go to that extracurricular work activity.  You may want to spend time with your kids. \n\n* Jonathan thinks back to this talk as a way to decide where his daily \"budget\" gets spent. \n\n* John has heard something similar as it relates to task management with the brain being powered by blood sugar to get us through the day. \n\n* We need to make sure there is enough blood sugar left (especially toward the end of the day) to spend time on the things we find important (i.e. family). \n\n* John previously thought about this in terms of arranging important work tasks but never really past that into the stuff that is \"the real world.\" \n\n* Likely this is going to align with burn out…not leaving enough time and energy to deal with the world past work, running out of energy early in the day. \n\n* When you run out of energy too early in the day and need to do it again the next day, you end up tapping into reserves to the point where you may not even be able to get out of bed. \n\n* Jonathan picked up project management skills at EMC and doing work for vBrownBag which seemed to align with the budgeting of energy and time. \n\n* If you're spent too early in the week it may result in an unplanned day off and a deadline being pushed.  Perhaps that is better than lesser quality work being delivered. \n\n* Nick mentioned a story he heard about someone who had a reminder to \"leave some for home\" each day.  \n\n* Jonathan and his wife put everything into a shared Google calendar. \n\n* There are days where he will get 20 invites from his wife because she is planning something and creates an invite for each item. \n\n* The family makes a habit of regularly checking in on the calendar.  \n\n* Jonathan knows people who have to-do list apps or use a whiteboard for reminders on the important stuff to do after work.  Find a system that works for you. \n\n* Recognize you may have to pull something back and not work the all-nighter in order to be present the next day for important personal events. \n\n* We manage our work calendars to ensure we avoid the conflicts, but then we will turn around and not do the same for home (the \"meetings\" we have with other members of the family). \n\n* We walk out of work thinking, \"I'm going to remember everything.\"  That probably isn't the case. \n\n## 31:22 - Learning and Applying #Scrum \n\n* Jonathan shares the story of taking part in a \"nerd herd\" at local Dunkin' Donuts locations from time to time. \n\n* Matt Broberg brought up the idea of [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) and tracking what you're doing in a simple format. #Kanban\n\n* Humans are truly wired to only do one thing at a time (i.e. can't write a script while you work in SQL Server Management Studio). \n\n* Lay out the things you need to do in the order they need to be done.  Am I waiting on anything to get one of these accomplished? \n\n* This led Jonathan into #Agile and Scrum, but at first everything about Scrum seemed to be focused on software development.  As he continued reading and thinking about the point of it, he thought of using this in his role as a Systems Administrator (applying the same concepts and methodology). \n\n* It seemed to fit into training at EMC.  How do you put enough content out into the field, get feedback, make changes, and get the polished version to the field later. \n\n* Jonathan fails to see where Scrum wouldn't fit.  It's about identifying the work that needs to be done and how much you can reasonably do in the time frame you're given. \n\n* This is in line with the idea of [deliberate practice](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice), which we know leads to mastery. [[|Deliberate Practice]] [[Deep Practice]]\n\n* Jonathan has been in roles where he was the only IT person and spread really thin.  Whether you are using this to plan your day or as a way to stay focused, this is a super helpful tool. \n\n* You can use Scrum anywhere if you are diligent about it.  There's this misconception that it means you can do more work when in reality it is about prioritizing the right work to complete at the right time. \n\n* Recognize you will spend a decent amount of time planning (a vacation, an app upgrade at work).  The outcome of the plan is knowing what you can achieve realistically. \n\n* At EMC when the team was piloting how to apply Scrum, another time came and asked Jonathan about it.  He showed them how they were using it to get feedback to deliver things quickly. \n\n* The team looked at it and said they didn't have enough time to do the planning and just needed to get work complete.  But they didn't produce meaningful output because they didn't take the time to plan. \n\n* Jonathan makes the point that the planning process helps us eliminate steps that are not required. \n\n* This is the idea of giving yourself everything full kit in the manufacturing world. \n\n* Listen to Jonathan's story of presenting on Scrum and asking the audience how long it would take to replace the faucet. \n\n* Most people thought they could do it in 30 minutes but didn't take into account they had no spare faucet at the house. \n\n* With Jonathan's current role as a Cloud Engineer, there are a ton of moving pieces and lots of teams to involve. \n\n* He may require output from another team before he can complete something but can at least document what is needed. \n\n* John says you have to approach the conversation a certain way if you're planning to tell someone a target is unreasonable. \n\n* Jonathan never thought of a fixed date as a requirement, but listed to his story from EMC about knowing the output of your team and using it to negotiate what the output looks like for fixed delivery dates. \n\n* \"If that date can't move, then we just work backward.\" - Jonathan Frappier \n\n* This is dependency mapping for an entire project. \n\n* One of the interesting tools is the [Kanban Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) (visualization of the tasks and the flows a task needs to go through - called a swim lane). \n\n* Maybe there are security reviews needed before something goes to production.  Add a swim lane in for that, and factor in the timelines. \n\n* Deliver step 1 for review and then work on step 2 rather than delivering an entire project only to find out you misinterpreted a step along the way. \n\n* This makes John want to investigate Scrum a bit deeper on his own. \n\n* Jonathan recommends some great books on the topic that are easy to digest: \n\n* [Scrum: a Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/dp/193796504X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_PRDKMJRDBTHNYW73KKZX)  [[Scrum: A Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction]]\n\n* [The Agile Samurai: How Agile Masters Deliver Great Software (Pragmatic Programmers)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1934356581/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_P8JNXW73W37EKG9JNFMF) [[The Agile Samurai]]\n\n## Other Episodes on Burnout \n\n* If you enjoyed this episode, go back and listen to the Tom Hollingsworth episodes: \n\n* [Episode 125 -

In today's episode we share part one of our interview with Donovan Farrow and his progression from IT Generalist to someone who developed an expertise in digital forensics and entered the Security industry in its early days. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-30-2021 \n\nTopics – Meet Donovan Farrow, Focus on Forensics, Not Quite Calling It Security, Information Security Management, Peacetime is Boring \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:38 – Meet Donovan Farrow and Alias (formerly Alias Forensics) \n\n* [Donovan Farrow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donovan-farrow-a80099111/) is CEO and founder of [Alias](https://aliasinfosec.com/company/), a digital forensics and cybersecurity company based in Oklahoma City. [[Donovan Farrow]] [[Alias Forensics]] \n\n* Listen to Donovan's description of all the things his company does, their size, and their biggest competitors. \n\n* Alias is classified as a bit of a boutique shop in terms of what they do and their attention to detail. \n\n* Donovan spoke at a [Dallas / Fort Worth SpiceCorps meeting](https://community.spiceworks.com/meeting/show/2758) in 2018 on digital forensics and penetration testing. [[Digital Forensics]] #Spiceworks \n\n* How Donovan got into the industry, the real story \n\n* He hated school but could fix computers. \n\n* How moving to Oklahoma City worked out \n\n* Donovan mowed lawns for a while and would use the money to buy computer parts. \n\n* He started working for a corporation at age 18 and did not have a degree until much later. \n\n* People have at times called him a gunslinger. \n\n* The job at an insurance firm allowed him to do a lot of tinkering, but he didn't get along with his boss and was fired. \n\n* Teaching and not making people feel stupid \n\n* At his next job, Donovan progressed to a leadership position after coming in with no certifications (only experience).  If people wanted to learn, he would teach them. \n\n* He wanted other people to know he loved the work. \n\n* Others in his past had made him feel stupid, and Donovan did not want anyone else to feel that way. \n\n* Getting fired, contract work, and catching full time work \n\n* Donovan got interviewed by many companies, including Chesapeake Energy and decided to work for a contract company. \n\n* Contracts were often sat on site and expected to \"do work,\" performing whatever task needed handling at the time. \n\n* Donovan did work for energy companies, a bank, a manufacturing company, and others. \n\n* The things he learned in this role were out of necessity and to keep getting work. \n\n* He was later hired by an oil field company to learn everything and move everyone out. \n\n* The company later changed their minds about moving others out and gave Donovan a full-time job instead of a contract position. \n\n-   Donovan was given every opportunity and never turned anything down, learning a ton in the process. \n    \n\n* First forensic case \n\n* This was around 2004, and Donovan's boss asked him to investigate possible misconduct of field workers, working with the global head of HR as part of the assignment. \n\n*  \n\n## 17:26 - The Focus on Forensics \n\n* [Forensic Focus forums early member](https://www.forensicfocus.com/) \n\n* Donovan had never heard of forensics before the above assignment. \n\n* He mentioned having knowledge of McAfee ePO. \n\n* At smaller companies, the Systems Administrator ends up being the one to dive into any kind of forensics projects out of necessity. \n\n* Some of the pitfalls \n\n* Donovan has worked about 2500 forensics cases at this point.  An attorney probably works around 25-30 cases per year. \n\n* There are a number of gotchas and ways to get yourself into trouble if processes are not followed or things are done incorrectly in a case such as being held personally liable. \n\n* Many times Donovan and his team have to testify in court.  The longest amount of time Donovan has spent on the stand testifying was 12 hours. \n\n* Flashing back to this first forensics investigation, Donovan had to document the chain of custody for the hard drive, did a forensic image, and then did an investigation. After that, he did not really know what to do.   \n\n* Unknowingly Donovan protected himself from getting into trouble in his thoroughness of taking multiple copies of the hard drive (tips he received from the Forensics Focus forums). \n\n* Being given more security work under the app/network security flag \n\n* Donovan's boss started to send all kinds of projects his way, including one for managing a Blackberry Enterprise Server. \n\n* The security focused work wasn't called security so much at that time.   \n\n* Physical port security \n\n* Donovan learned to turn off physical network ports in offices to present people from plugging in their personal computer at work. \n\n* He was doing security stuff and didn't realize it. \n\n## 27:16 - Not Quite Calling It Security Yet \n\n* Donovan started getting into servers and networking as well as Active Directory. \n\n* It started as a joke, kind of a look what I can do with these tools.   \n\n* Listen to Donovan describe exposure to early trojans like [Sub7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub7) that was transmitted via e-mail. \n\n* AD based pranking and the connection to hacking \n\n* Donovan shares the story of a prank he pulled on his teammates, which wasn't so different from what hackers did to Sony. \n\n* Other forums Donovan used and forum credibility \n\n* There were some security news groups Donovan was a part of in addition to Forensics Focus.   \n\n* A hackers elite forum was also a great place to get help.  Participation was a chance to gain credibility in what was (at the time) kind of a niche area. \n\n## 31:40 - Transitioning to Information Security Manager \n\n* Conversation with the manager which led to applying at an energy company \n\n* Donovan called his manager's bluff on being encouraged to apply for the job if he wanted more money. \n\n* He started in at the company as a contractor but moved into a  forensic analyst position without a degree. \n\n* The company couldn't find anyone with experience in this area until Donovan applied.  They relaxed the degree requirement for him. \n\n* There was no special security clearance required.  He worked with security teams to determine how to hunt down malware as well as on forensics investigations. \n\n* There was a lot of great talent at the company during this time. \n\n* Donovan outgrew the role eventually and set up forensic and security labs elsewhere. \n\n* Donovan has a great story about meeting and stopping [Sean Satterlee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seansatterlee/) during a penetration test Donovan didn't know was happening. [[sean Satterlee]]\n\n* Blue team / purple team is where Donovan started.  He refers to Sean as a red teamer. \n\n* The first #ransomware incident \n\n* Server teams back then wanted minimal software on the servers to prevent performance issues.  And then ransomware hit, but no one truly knew what it was and expected Donovan to fix it. \n\n* The ransom was around $40K at the time, and the attackers knew very little about what they were attacking. \n\n* No one knew which of the 5000 machines were infected.  Listen to the strategy for making sure the environment was clean after discovering this threat. \n\n* Donovan works well under pressure and enjoyed the pressure of these types of situations. \n\n## 40:17 - Peacetime is Boring \n\n* Donovan is a serial entrepreneur with a total of 5 businesses in his career.  Once things are running well inside a company, he doesn't like it. \n\n* Moving to NTT Security incident response \n\n* There were 6 companies compromised that Donovan needed to handle when he started. \n\n* This is the place where Donovan learned about penetration testing. \n\n* Starting Alias and deciding to commit to it \n\n* The role at NTT involved a great deal of travel, and Donovan had a family he wanted to see more often.  He jumped in with both feet to get it off the ground. \n\n* Donovan was doing contract work which eventually turned into Alias. \n\n* It was a fun hobby, a side gig. \n\n* Proving innocent people innocent using data \n\n* Donovan has been able to prove at least 4 people were innocent, effectively saving those people from going to jail for life. \n\n* Donovan shares one specific example that is open record.  \n\n* \"The best witness is the data.\" - Donovan Farrow \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-134":{"title":"Episode 134","content":"\n# Episode 134\n\nWelcome to episode 134 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

Yes! #Generalist \n\n* And give Donovan a call if that is what you want to do! \n\n* Generalists are overlooked.  If Donovan can talk to someone like this about exploits, metasploits, and lateral movement…they will be great penetration testers. \n\n* The market is super thin for folks like this. \n\n* Building the community \n\n* We want to make the community stronger by teaching people how to get into it. \n\n* Antennas and proximity cards \n\n* Donovan's team, when they go home, does research and development.  They are junkies when it comes to the technology. \n\n* They can duplicate a proxy card easily within 4 feet when hired to break into a company. \n\n* Red flags during interviews \n\n* Some people have a god complex and love power (love being in charge, etc.) and control.  These folks may withold information. \n\n* The good guy wants to break in but has to let the client know.  They want to fix the situation and provide the client with a better solution to prevent this from happening in the future. \n\n* Donovan and team also do deep background checks for new employees. \n\n## 13:10 - [[Mentorship]] \n\n* Donovan was lacking it coming into the industry and never really had anyone to help him. \n\n* He hated figuring out things on his own. \n\n* Donovan never wants someone to be alone if they are trying to do something better for humanity. \n\n* Legacy vs. money \n\n* If one person was impacted by the help Donovan provided, it means more than anything else.   \n\n* Legacies get passed down and never watered down. \n\n* Donovan hopes part of his legacy will be making jobs for people in cybersecurity in Oklahoma and Texas. \n\n* \"Legends never die.\" - The Sandlot \n\n* Giving back is the biggest reward \n\n* Whether it be money or time, if you have been given a gift, it is your duty to give back. \n\n* Donovan mentors a number of people for free and asks them to pay it forward to others. \n\n## 17:11 - Running Your Own Company [[Entrepreneurship]] \n\n* There was a need to fill according to Donovan.  There are IT folks who specialize in databases, servers, etc. Then there are forensics folks.  You don’t want the forensics people treating your cold, for example. \n\n* Cybersecurity was once an afterthought.  Now it's consistently in the news. \n\n* Making mistakes \n\n* This started as a hobby and came as a company.  Being responsible for the employees and their families is kind of a panic moment.  You get used to it after a while. \n\n* Operating debt-free \n\n* Donovan only operates through cash.  Even through COVID, they grew and didn't let any employees go. \n\n* Saving vs. spending \n\n* If you don't need the money, don't spend it.  Donovan worked two jobs for a long time. \n\n* Buckle in, and let others live it up with fancy vacations and exquisite things.  You don't have to spend all of your money. \n\n* You have to start at the bottom.  Don't think you're going to get rich quick. \n\n* Donovan saved a full year of salaries to start Alias. \n\n* Major debt can cause stress and other issues. \n\n* Investing in the company \n\n* When people tell Donovan they gave themselves a raise as business owners, he questions their motivations and why they would not want to invest it back into the company. \n\n## 23:46 - Deciding Correct Services to Offer \n\n* Transition from Alias \"Forensics\" \n\n* There was forensics and also incident response.  From that point, clients started asking about security. \n\n* Pen testing services were driven by customer need. \n\n* You have to move with the time and what is necessary. \n\n* How do you let the world know you've added a new focus? \n\n* One of the most important parts of the business is marketing.   \n\n* It took a couple of years to communicate that Alias did Security as well as forensics. They grew a community without changing the name. \n\n* Check out the [Secure AF Podcast](https://aliasinfosec.com/resources/secure-af/) run by Donovan's company. [[Secure AF Podcast]]\n\n* Moving into a new market \n\n* The company moved into Dallas.  During COVID was the right time to change the name to just Alias, and it ended up growing the company. \n\n* They kept the logo and rebranded a little.  Everyone in Oklahoma knows who the company is.  \n\n* Personal focus can work the same way \n\n* If you are not going to make your work look good, don't do it. \n\n* You have about 1/8 of a second to get someone's attention on LinkedIn.  Make sure whatever you put out there is something you would want to look at too. \n\n* Piecing together a body of work \n\n* Most of the things customers needed came in the form of \"can you do this?\"  Donovan had the experience in the industry to explain how he would go about it even if he hadn't done that exact thing.  \n\n* There's almost too much information out there for us to learn a niche because we get lazy, or things on YouTube might not seem unique enough. \n\n## 31:09 - Being on a Board of Directors \n\n* Tax dollars supporting Oklahoma companies instead of out-of-state companies \n\n* Donovan is on the board for [OITA](https://oklahomaita.com/). \n\n* Donovan's goal for a long time has been supporting Oklahoma jobs and tax base, and increasing talent in the security/forensics industry. \n\n* There's a sense of pride in where you're from here.  Donovan was born and raised in Oklahoma and wants to make it better for his children and future generations.   \n\n* Supporting those battling imposter syndrome \n\n* Many in our industry have this issue. \n\n* Anyone can do IT, but can they?  Are they?  If you're doing it and taking the next step is doing more than someone else. \n\n* Donovan realized he was \"special enough\" to help advise the state and make it better.  He had impostor syndrome heavily. \n\n* If you think you are just some person doing this, you're probably wrong.  Take a look in the mirror, realize what you are doing, and that means more than the person telling you that you are not worth it. \n\n* \"The impostor is proof that we are creating, innovating, and leading.\" - [[Seth Godin]], [The Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Shipping-Creative-Work/dp/0593328973) [[The Practice]]\n\n* Time commitment of a Board depends on the cause \n\n* Typically it is once per quarter.  Donovan has some that meet monthly and some that meet bi-annually. \n\n* Board seat vs Board advisor \n\n* Donovan was recruited to be on boards or be an advisor to boards of directors. \n\n* It's a way to meet a lot of smart people with different perspectives.  Donovan seeks to learn from the wisdom of those with greater experience. \n\n* Difference from owning a company – the strategic view \n\n* Owning a company is gunslinging, moving revenue, etc. \n\n* Donovan uses the illustration of analyzing a painting to explain what being on a board is like.  It's methodical, and you can really digest the company, see how it is moving, look at the revenue without being in a hurry to make money, etc.  It's like looking at a forest from outside the forest. \n\n* You're trying to take the blinders off for somoene like a CEO. \n\n## 41:18 - Closing Thoughts \n\n* How do you decide what's next? \n\n* Invest to build wealth so one day you don't have to work. \n\n* Watch this space! \n\n* [ ] There is a point where you can only take it so far by yourself.  Donovan references the book [Scaling Up](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Up-Mastering-Rockefeller-Habits/dp/0986019593).   [[Scaling Up]]\n\n* What's the best and worst career advice you've ever received? \n\n* The worst advice was from a former boss that said Donovan would never go anywhere without a degree.  He's not against degrees but proved that to be wrong. \n\n* Never forget where you came from.  Don't get too big.   If you get too big, you overrate yourself and burn out.  If you get too big, you lose track of how you got to where you are.  The people surrounding you and trusted you helped you get to where you wanted to go. \n\n* Donovan is on LinkedIn [Donovan Farrow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donovan-farrow-a80099111/) if you want to contact him. \n\n* It may take time for him to respond, and he chooses to give people his full attention so interactions are quality interactions. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-135":{"title":"Episode 135","content":"\n# Episode 135\n\nWelcome to episode 135 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of our discussion with Blake Johnson in which we discuss Blake's education, early career, how he became obsessed with fitness, and some incremental ways to become more fit.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date:  07-08-2021 \n\nTopics – Meet Blake Johnson, The Second Degree and Getting into Sales, Situational Pressures, Strength and Conditioning for Success [[Blake Johnson]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 4:10 - Meet Blake Johnson \n\n* Blake Johnson (find him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blake-johnson-104367104/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vivalablake)) is a simple salesman who is passionate about people and has a background in a number of areas. \n\n* Blake calls himself the perfect millennial who didn't quite know what he wanted to do but wanted to do everything. \n\n* He got a degree in English Rhetoric while pursing business studies.  Blake is a big fan of having to explain your answers. \n\n* Blake considered law school but decided he liked the people better than the profession. \n\n* He played football and really enjoyed strength and conditioning, eventually leading to a Biology degree. \n\n* He describes himself today as someone living the dream. \n\n* Listen to the difference between rhetoric and English rhetoric. \n\n## 6:07 - The Second Degree and Getting into Sales \n\n* Blake moved to Texas after graduation since he has some family there, ending up at Baylor. \n\n* Biology forced him to keep thinking and expand his comfort zone.  He believed sitting in a lab or behind an operating table might not be best for him. \n\n* In a sales role today, he gets to make an impact on people and meet people of all types. \n\n* Blake was a strength and conditioning coach (not really sales).  Your product is who you are, and who you are is your product.  The focus is on taking care of clients and helping them reach the next level of success. \n\n* Blake told his boss at the time that he wanted to learn the business side of things, seeking to understand it better. \n\n* He later stepped into a General Manager role and understood how to sell strength and conditioning services. \n\n* In the sports performance world he was in charge of books, staff, doing some coaching, and taking the facility from one point to another while ensuring the product and the community was well taken care of (owning profit and loss of a single facility). \n\n* Does moving from someone who practices strength and conditioning coaching to someone who sells it make you removed from the practice of doing it? \n\n* Blake said when he was just a coach he wanted nothing to do with the sales teams, wanting only to focus on his role. \n\n* Once he was able to step back from the role and look at it from an outside perspective, he understood the sales side, making him a better salesman and ultimately a better coach. \n\n* Blake understood the product and the value of it to the consumer (athletes).  Putting those two together made things so much better. \n\n* John makes the point that aligning the practice (i.e. what someone does as a practitioner) with the value received by people we are working with or for is a challenge for technology practitioners.   \n\n* This was a struggle for John and something he did not learn until moving into Sales Engineering.   \n\n* Blake says he learned to think and understand systems, which helped him understand everything about the job and be a better team member.     \n\n* Nick speaks to people being stuck in their bubble and not understanding how what they do fits within the goals of the company and how learning the company's business process can help. \n\n* In strength and conditioning, some coaches did not care about the bottom line.  Some salespeople only cared about getting revenue.  The people who wanted to understand both are the ones who were successful and pushed past their ceilings.  Blake was someone who wanted to learn it all. \n\n* John makes some interesting analogies about systems and cross domain connections. \n\n* Everything isn't that different.  We're all the main characters in our own movie.  Every system at the end of the day is similar.  Make those connections to connect with people.   \n\n## 18:32 - Situational Pressures \n\n* Understanding the needs of the person is important.  At the end of the day we are trying to serve others and fulfill needs. \n\n* Blake is in a job where he is selling a product to a consumer, not human changing things.  We can make that same transaction just as important without trivializing it. \n\n* There's more pressure when you're trying to change a human's life as a coach.  Most people don't come to a coach at their best. \n\n* There is pressure because Blake wants to succeed as much as the person who came to get coached wants to succeed.  It's more fun because of that human to human interaction. \n\n* In a product sale it's kind of an A-B transaction unless you keep up with that person. \n\n* Nick and John pontificate on how those that sell software can coach customers along the path to success, including regular measurement.  \"Your success is my success.\" \n\n* As the world continues to change and we've had to find creative ways to interact, it is going to take the extra bit of creative humanity in relationships with people to make the difference. \n\n* Transactions don't have to be zero sum games with a winner and a loser.  It can be a mutual win. \n\n* John is sold on the idea of making positive human interaction an important part of career success. \n\n## 25:06 - Strength and Conditioning for Success  \n\n* Healthy body, healthy mind - life changes so much when your body is working well and your mind is clear. \n\n* The world will not get easier, and the noise will not go away. We can control only what we can control.  The biggest culprit and helper is our brain. \n\n* Blake has clients who don't talk about the weight they lost.  They talk about how they feel. \n\n* The people who look like they are having a blast are the ones taking care of themselves.   \n\n* We live in a society that makes being healthy difficult.  There is so much noise out there.   \n\n* John mentions many people are looking for shortcuts. \n\n* Blake says instant gratification has been there since the dawn of time and does not recommend the [keto diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet) for anyone (not good for you). #Keto\n\n* Move around, and do what makes you feel good. \n\n* If working out 2 hours a day in the gym is something you enjoy, go for it.  If running is your thing, go for it.  If you love playing with your dogs, find a way to do it outside and play with them. \n\n* Find creative ways to stay moving.  Do what you can to keep organs healthy and reduce body fat. \n\n* Blake uses the analogy of a car to represent our bodies.  Would you rather be a Prius or a Lamborghini?  Premium cars require premium fuel (food). \n\n* Stick with real food that has raw ingredients that you prepare.  Keep things simple. \n\n* Drink more water, and move around more. \n\n* Focus on what makes you motivated.  That is where the success comes.   \n\n* What if you are someone who does not know how to get started? \n\n* There is no downside to asking for help.  Blake might give people 10 different options to see if they work and help generate more if they don't. \n\n* Until you know that you want to make a change, no one else can do it for you. \n\n* Blake has worked with athletes that should be hall of famers, but they were not motivated enough. \n\n* John mentioned differences in dopamine levels in different people. \n\n* Blake was once someone who hated working out.  When he was finished in college, he never wanted to do it again. \n\n* Three months later, he hated how he felt.  The common denominator was he was not doing anything for himself. \n\n* Blake started riding his bike around campus. Once he started liking that activity, he joined an intramural team.  That led to going back to the gym. \n\n* Now he's obsessed with fitness.  It's not a job.  It's something he has to do.  Not until he started getting into shape for himself (not for a coach, not for a team, not for a sport) did it begin to impact him differently and become something important. \n\n* John hears parallels to IT and technology changes organizations make (as well as the reasons for them).  We do this with business processes, facilities, and people (many other things too). \n\n* This is about incremental change. Blake sets the expectation with his clients that change is not going to happen overnight or in a month.  You will see some changes in a month, but it doesn't stop there.  The minimum engagement Blake will do with someone is 3 months.   \n\n* Setting the expectation is important with a coaching client just like with businesses.  Focus on the first step, and take things on in little chunks to build momentum.  Otherwise the change will be too much, someone will get frustrated, and look for something else. \n\n* We're talking about building better habits.  If you can change the processes in small phases you can optimize the system. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-136":{"title":"Episode 136","content":"\n# Episode 136\n\nWelcome to episode 136 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Blake Johnson.  We discuss ways to get started with fitness and stay the course, dealing with accountability and shame, what we can learn from the life of a car salesman, and thoughts on finding your why.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date:  07-08-2021 \n\n[[Blake Johnson]] (find him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blake-johnson-104367104/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vivalablake)) is a simple salesman who is passionate about people.  He is also the owner of [Manifest Fit](https://www.manifestfit.com/about-us). [[Manifest Fit]]\n\nTopics – Getting Started with Fitness and Staying the Course, Accountability and Shame, Human Improvement, Life of a Car Salesman, Finding Your Why and Closing Thoughts \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:18 - Getting Started with Fitness and Staying the Course \n\n* Blake has a client with bad knees who reached out to him asking to feel better. \n\n* This person noticed they had to tighten their watch band and was able to play with his kids all day without getting tired. \n\n* The way this person quantifies success is playing with his kids all day. \n\n* Blake has a client who used to be diabetic because of soda consumption.   \n\n* They dialed back the consumption, and this person drank more water and was able to push harder at the gym. \n\n* Some people don't want to go to the gym because \"that's where fit people are.\" \n\n* We self-sabotage quite a bit with preconceived assumptions about the places we go (like gyms). \n\n* Step back.  Are all gyms bad?  If you feel they are, what can be done within those limits (playground, park, at home, etc.)? \n\n* \"The only reason I am not where I want to be in my life is because I stopped myself before I even started.\" - Blake Johnson \n\n* Can you watch a video and follow it, take a walk in the neighborhood, or go somewhere you enjoy?  Maybe that helps you build up to getting a coach or going to a gym (even if you just step in and watch).  You have to start somewhere. \n\n* Nick likes the idea of measuring what matters (feeling better) instead of focusing on the numbers of waistline and pounds. \n\n* How about \"I don't have time to exercise?\" \n\n* We all have the same amount of time in a day. \n\n* You will not have time for things that are not important to you.  We make time for what matters. \n\n* Blake hates waking up at 5 AM, but working out for him is more important than not working out.  And he knows once he gets home from work he is not going to work out. \n\n* If you only have 30 minutes, that is a ton of time.  It doesn't have to be 2 hours. \n\n* There are many ways to get to where we want to be within time limits.  Even if it's 20 minutes, we can change our activities to allow ourselves to make progress even in short time periods. \n\n* If you don't have time, you may one day sitting next to a doctor hearing \"you should have found time.\" \n\n* There's always a reason to not do something.  Figuring out that something is important to your success, understanding objections, figuring out ways around them is essential. \n\n* What about staying the course? \n\n* It isn't easy.  Increasing fitness isn't easy and may feel like work. \n\n* \"There is no growth in the comfort zone.  There is no comfort in the growth zone.\" - Blake Johnson \n\n* If I'm comfortable I need to go get uncomfortable. \n\n* If it were easy, everyone would do it and look like the fittest athlete we know. \n\n* Blake says embrace the discomfort.  If I stayed comfortable, I would be who I was ten years ago.  And that's not acceptable. \n\n* This isn't something that is easy even for elite athletes. They have just found a way to make it major part of their lives (a must have for them). \n\n* This makes the process more human.  People at the gym who look fit are struggling too, struggling to get better.  One day, you could be struggling with them. \n\n## 14:55 - #Accountability and #Shame \n\n* Does staying the course mean you need to exercise daily? \n\n* Life happens.  Regardless of what happened in the past we are here right now.  Every client Blake works with has a goal (certain number of days per week, no one size fits all). \n\n* If goals don't get reached, don't beat yourself up.  Focus on the successes and not the misses. \n\n* Staying the course is answering the question \"why did we get off track?\" \n\n* Maybe you ate bad food and missed a workout.  Consider ways to change it next time so you will feel better.  \n\n* Staying the course is being honest with yourself and having accountability without the judgement.  There is a lot of judgement out there. \n\n* Either change the behavior, or change the fitness program accordingly.  There is no one size fits all.  We need to be able to adapt to reach goals in anything we do. \n\n* Nick mentions this sounds like an episode of [Packet Pushers](https://packetpushers.net/) discussing blameless post mortems.  When someone asks you why you missed the mark, it comes with a fear of judgement. \n\n* At the end of the day, if you need to be held accountable that is important.  What if we were held accountable / held ourselves accountable without necessarily feeling shame? \n\n* Some people play the shame game.  Instead…acknowledge it, fix it, and move on.  \n\n* John mentioned people can be more comfortable in the shame spiral than in making a positive change. \n\n* Blake said he's read psychology studies about why people stay in bad situations (regardless of what it is).  \n\n* We overload the senses so much we end up staying where we are. \n\n* If Blake could change the world, he'd want everyone to learn about psychology and philosophy to be more well rounded. \n\n## 22:18 - Human Improvement \n\n* Life is short.  We only have one shot at this life.  Life is far too short to not maximize our abilities, to wake up feeling bad, to not give yourself ample opportunity to go out and have fun, or not love every second of it. \n\n* Blake needed to be different things growing up.  One day he decided he wanted to focus on his life being the life he wanted it to be. \n\n* He focused on treating people well.  They in term started treating him a lot better.  \n\n* Blake focused on surrounding himself with positive thinking and situations that made him feel better. \n\n* There is no reset button or cheat code.  We cannot surround ourselves with that kind of thinking. \n\n* It's easy to look at someone else and say \"why can't I be like that.  They have so much.\"  That person probably feels the same way about something else. \n\n* Life is short.  Maximize it. \n\n## 25:00 - Life of a Car Salesman \n\n* Nick mentioned it's one thing to love what you do but another to master your field and succeed.  Does the work involved ever become just work? \n\n* Blake says strength and conditioning at one point became a chore. \n\n* Blake owns his own business and can pour the parts he loves into it. \n\n* Life is too short to do what you hate.  But Blake doesn't want to surround himself with just his passions and gives the example of pursuing a PhD. \n\n* Strength and conditioning was his full career for 6+ years.  Add personal training before that, and it makes about a decade. \n\n* He's found his own style of training. \n\n* Blake has childish joy about being able to run his own business. \n\n* Blake is a car salesman today.  Does that surprise you we have not mentioned it to this point?  He's in the customer service game and just happens to sell cars. \n\n* He gets to meet and talk with incredible people who are passionate about other things. \n\n* It's a bonus that Blake can keep reading the books he wants to read and can train the way he wants to train, doing what he loves. \n\n* Blake loves life, and he loves people. \n\n* Of all the things that you could sell, selling cars didn't seem to mesh (on the surface) with the positivity and self-actualization we've discussed. \n\n* If you had told Blake 5 years ago or any time in his life that he would be selling cars, he would have laughed at you. \n\n* When he stepped away from strength and conditioning, he started applying for several jobs.  One of them was selling cars for the company he works for now. \n\n* Blake would not be in the car game if it was not for this company.  They have a reputation for customer service and taking care of both customers and employees. \n\n* Blake could tell during the interview process that the company wasn't fake. \n\n* He decided he could learn how to sell cars to work at this company. \n\n* Blake says car salesmen basically earn their reputations.  He's work with many of them and heard lots of stories from customers. \n\n* Blake can take what many people consider a loathsome experience and turn it into \"that was a positive experience.\"  He is enjoying the chance to change people's perception of what the experience should be. \n\n* If buying a car can be a decent experience, imagine how many other experiences we could re-engineer.  \n\n* The work has been both challenging and fun. \n\n* John highlights car sales as a 100% commission job in some cases, a system to grind down the customer, etc. \n\n* There can be companies who don't fit this mold and seek to break out in a positive way. \n\n* Blake's company (which is about to celebrate their 110th year) is going to give a fair price and negotiate if they can in addition to treating customers well. \n\n* We'd rather have a repeat customer than a one time customer.  Take care of people the honest, right way, and the results speak for themselves. \n\n* Blake does birthday cards by the way! \n\n* John points out the disappearing asymmetry of information in the car buying process. \n\n* Blake says his company has used the golden rule of treatment to others much like the hospitality industry has adopted. \n\n* If Blake doesn't sell, he doesn't get paid.  The company treats him not like the new guy but like an associate no different than anyone.  The culture was refreshing. \n\n## 37:17 - Finding Your Why and Closing Thoughts \n\n* Listen to Nick share the story of meeting Blake. \n\n* No matter what we do, if you don't have a reason why you do it, you will not be as successful as you could be. \n\n* If you don't have a why, none of the how / what / etc. really matters. \n\n* Blake's why is he loves taking care of people and making their lives better. \n\n* Whether it's building [Manifest Fit](https://www.manifestfit.com/) or working for the company where he sells cars, Blake's why has always stayed the same - treat people well and leave a positive impact. \n\n* If you can't answer why you show up every day, think about it.  How can you figure it out and maybe navigate your life a bit differently? \n\n* A number of previous guests agreed that aligning personal values with their company's values was a reason for joining, regardless of role. \n\n* For where Blake and his wife are and what they value, it came down to where he felt more at home with an employer. That was the guiding light when he had to decide between two potential offers. \n\n* Parting thoughts \n\n* The best advice and the worse advice was the same. Do what you love.  This can be a big rabbit hole of frustration and may not turn into a career. \n\n* At the same time, if you do something you hate, it is not going to be beneficial.  Life is way too short to settle for less than YOUR best (not the best but your best).   \n\n* Create a 3-dimensional life for yourself. \n\n* Feel free to reach out to Blake on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vivalablake/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vivalablake).  Find and follow Manifest Fit on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/manifest_fit) as well. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-137":{"title":"Episode 137","content":"\n# Episode 137\n\nWelcome to episode 137 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Don Jones.  Don will share his origin story in IT and the traversal through individual contributor, management, writing, being independent, and teaching. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-14-2021 \n\nTopics – Don's Origin Story, Manager and Individual Contributor (IC), Hard Experience and Career Mistakes, Writing Skills and Seeing Blind Spots, Something to Offer, Losing Tech Chops [[Don Jones]] \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:38 - Introducing Don Jones \n\n* Don Jones (find him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/concentrateddon/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/concentrateddon)) started in the tech industry in the 1990s as an Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE). \n\n* He has been a conference speaker and [author of around 60 technical books](https://donjones.com/book-series/tech/). \n\n* Don is currently [Head of Developer Skills for Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/browse/software-development), determining the topics needed and how deep to go in terms of developer content. \n\n* He currently [authors fiction books](https://donjones.com/) to scratch the writing itch. \n\n* Check out Don's career project [Ampere Club](https://ampere.club/) and an upcoming career focused virtual event called [AmpNavigator](https://ampere.club/ampnavigator/) happening October 7-8 2021. \n\n## 4:49 - Don's Origin Story \n\n* In childhood Don had a Commodore 64 and liked to work on it while other kids were outside playing. \n\n* The school guidance counselor said lack of patience with math meant Don couldn't pursue computers.  This was the 80s (so whatever that meant). \n\n* Don switched out of an honors track in high school to a vocational school to study electronics and computer repair.  \n\n* Don was recruited by the Navy to be an civilian aircraft engineering mechanic apprentice \n\n* He worked on the F14 Tomcat and A6 Intruder platforms. \n\n* After doing a presentation on repairing/upgrading computers, a co-worker urged him to pursue it as a career and get out of the Navy.  \n\n* After a base re-org, he left to work for Electronics Boutique (EB Games, purchased by GameStop many years ago) \n\n* Don went from Sales Associate to Assistant Manager to Store Manager very quickly. \n\n* Then he got a job at the home office working the evening shift point-of-sale system helpdesk. \n\n* Don then moved to working on an AS400 platform. \n\n* He wrote a new Visual Basic POS system \n\n* Don left the company to be a network engineer and had no exposure to it, learning via books until he snagged a MCSE. \n\n* The company gave a bonus for each certification so he collected several.  \n\n* He went to work for Bell Atlantic as a network administrator. \n\n* Don got connected with the vendor used for Instructor Led Training (ILT) and was interested in becoming a Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT). \n\n* Don started teaching night courses at Penn State University to former aircraft mechanics from Boeing. \n\n* He loved it and hired on at the training company. \n\n* Don eventually ran their training and courseware group and later ran the software consulting business there. \n\n* At this point Don had an internal crisis about being in senior leadership and took a job as a web developer for a dot-com (Craftopia.com). \n\n* He wanted to go back to being an individual contributor \n\n* The company dot-busted just as Don scored his first book deal. \n\n* He was mostly independent from 2010 to 2014.   \n\n* In 2014, Don decided that being independent was pretty difficult. \n\n* He approached Pluralsight after their acquisition of TrainSignal and has been with the company ever since. \n\n## 10:02 - Manager and Individual Contributor (IC) \n\n* The freak out Don mentioned is something he has seen in a lot of people. \n\n* You are no longer capable of creating your own success (team has to). \n\n* You are not producing, and success is dependent on others. It is difficult to have that taken away \n\n* Leaders may have no emotional sense of whether today was a good day (as perhaps an individual contributor can based on accomplishments). \n\n* That knowledge might be not be obvious for a month. \n\n* You need to find emotional ground in other metrics.  Pull back, and take a bigger view. \n\n* If you don't realize this, it can be depressing. \n\n* It can feel like tech skills are eroding. \n\n* Team member mistakes can start to feel personal because we internalize them. \n\n* Success for a leader isn't the same as success for an individual contributor.   \n\n* It took Don a few cycles for these things to sink in. \n\n* Help from coaches and mentors may be required. \n\n* Once one realizes and learns, leadership can be extremely rewarding, just not in the same way as what you did previously. \n\n* It's a different job with different skills. \n\n* Being a great IC doesn't mean one will be a great manager of that type of team.   \n\n* Separate the idea of manager and leader in your head.  They are different things. \n\n* You can lead as a peer.  You can lead without being the boss. \n\n* Managers handle resource allocation, measuring progress, etc. \n\n* If you want to be a manager, try being a leader first.  This does not require a promotion. \n\n* If that feels good, you can learn to be a good manager. \n\n* The best managers are also good leaders.  Where we fail is having managers who are not good leaders.  We've all heard stories about this. \n\n* Don tells people to lead from within and is working on an eBook called Leadership not just for Bosses.  There are certain behaviors managers have to do and are paid for, but there are behaviors leaders have that are not / don't have to be tied to a supervisory job duty.  \n\n* John says we get used to measuring success daily as individual contributors. \n\n* Don managed his career on a day to day basis (opportunistic, transactional, where most of us live in our heads). \n\n* Once you start thinking about what a good week, month, and quarter look like you start to take a different attitude with personal decisions.  This begins a planning process.  You're sliding from being a passenger to being a driver looking down the road and setting longer term goals than the scope of this day or this week. \n\n* Once you start doing that, you become a better leader and manager.  You really learn how to own your career instead of having something inflicted on you. \n\n* Many of us spend too much time in the traffic jam.  It's worth pulling off the road and re-calibrating the GPS to rise above the traffic for a minute.  Your career is worth it. \n\n## 17:19 - Hard Experience and Career Mistakes \n\n* For Don, this came through hard experience. \n\n* In his role as an aircraft mechanic years ago, one of the jobs was to overhaul airplanes. \n\n* If a battle damaged aircraft had come back, he and his co-workers would need to do the analysis to determine the minimum steps needed to make it fly again, even if it was going to be the last flight.   \n\n* Don has analyzed his choices and situations many times over, sometimes in too much depth. \n\n* Don had a number of course corrections throughout his career. \n\n* When he was independent, Don was worried about where his next check would come from (crippling anxiety attacks about paying the bills).  As a result, he would take any job (one of them being writing eCommerce for Dummies). \n\n* People don't know who you are and what you're about.  Don made a decision to focus in a specific underserved area after some market analysis.  In 2002, that thing was VBScript for Windows Administrators.   \n\n* This rolled into Windows PowerShell and launched Don into achieving Microsoft MVP for 16 years.   \n\n* It helped people know who Don was and the problem he solved. \n\n* Your employer hires you to perform a service / to solve a problem.  Know what problem you solve, and people will want to buy it.  If you can't describe the problem you solve it is difficult for others to understand it too. \n\n* When independent, it forces you to make decisions.  So much of your time is burned in other areas. \n\n* Don had to make sure his productive time was producing money. \n\n* Branding is a big part of it.  Deciding who you are and the problem you solve was the meta level realization Don had to come to. \n\n* Don spent a lot of time doing things he was not great at.  For example, preparing for a marketing webinar takes hours of preparation.  But, writing 5000 words is something Don could easily churn out before the end of a work day. \n\n* He had to start inventorying skills and playing to them.  Start with the strong thing and get really good at that. \n\n* You can't do all the things all at once. \n\n* Don's lack of college meant it took him a little longer to realize he was missing some important skills.   \n\n* Look at the people in the positions you want.  Do they have good business acumen?  You probably need to be build your business acumen. \n\n* Don was so good at tech, but there was much more he needed to learn.  He studied business acumen and took some train the trainer courses to fill gaps. \n\n* Don recently released [Own Your Tech Career](https://www.manning.com/books/own-your-tech-career).  Much of the advice given in this book is an inventory of the things Don wishes he'd known 20-30 years ago. \n\n## 25:11 - Writing Skills and Seeing Blind Spots \n\n* At Bell Atlantic, there were a number of technology migrations.  Don made the decision to move to Microsoft Exchange. \n\n* He could rifle off a 4-page e-mail in no time. \n\n* Don got really good at organizing his thoughts. \n\n* When he went independent, he really started analyzing his time at a deeper level. \n\n* When am I most productive?   \n\n* How long can I be that productive?   \n\n* What do I need to do ahead of that to ensure I can be that productive? \n\n* Don outlines very aggressively for books.  Before going to bed, he will read the outline for a chapter he wants to write the next day.  Upon getting up, he will respond to e-mail for about 30 minutes and then write the chapter. \n\n* A great day for Don is about 10,000 words. \n\n* This process was developed through paying close attention to what worked and what did not. \n\n* He wrote 6 IT books per year for the first 2 years he was independent.  You get better at it as you continue to do it (not just writing but anything).  Think snowball effect here. \n\n* Continue to optimize your process.  Building a server for the first time is slow, but the next time won't take you as long.  Eventually you start to sequence and get even faster.   \n\n* We're talking about skills obtained through hours of practice, analyzing what does and does not work. \n\n* Don shares a story about attending a Microsoft Tech Day event in a foreign country. \n\n* He did two different 90 minute presentations.  Don wanted to get some laughs but never heard any feedback from the crowd, thinking the sessions did not go well. \n\n* It turns out the crowd reaction was related to cultural behavior in that country, but Don didn't find out until after his presentations. \n\n* Many times there is a cultural embarrassment over not speaking the language well.  In some cultures asking teachers a question is seen as confrontation (i.e. sign that the teacher has not done well).  \n\n* Expected feedback (auditory and visual) being removed makes things challenging because it's not expected / you didn't expect it going into a situation (i.e. in the case of cultural differences). \n\n* Being aware that these things happen allows your brain to analyze the situation a bit more.  We might need to moderate our expectations accordingly. \n\n## 35:08 - Something to Offer \n\n* So many in tech suffer from crippling impostor syndrome that we believe we have nothing to offer.  We tend to just keep quiet, absorbing information but putting nothing back into the world. \n\n* You have a different background and culture.  For example, Don can explain just about anything using a car analogy.  That may not work for everyone. \n\n* Teaching is not putting new information out into the world.  Teaching is taking information that already exists and repackaging it for a specific audience. [[Teaching is repackaging]]\n\n* We all have something to give back (i.e. something to offer). There is information we can re-package for an audience we're familiar with.    [[Show Your Work]]\n\n* Eventually, if we help people along enough, they won't need us any longer.  They will be able to go to the source information and repackage for someone else. \n\n* Try explaining something in a way that makes sense to you.  It's going to resonate with someone else. \n\n* The tech industry is one of the highest paying industries comparable to the medical / legal field, for example.  The medical field and others require things like an apprenticeship and serious amounts of education. \n\n* You can teach yourself to code and publish apps from an iPad.  The barrier to entry is extremely low…if you can learn it. \n\n* We need everyone to learn how to code.  You're not hurting yourself by helping someone come into the industry. \n\n* The idea of teaching someone else is incredibly meaningful and has the potential to change someone's life. \n\n* Nick makes the point that we may fear teaching others skills we have because we are afraid they will be promoted before we are. \n\n* Don says teaching is force multiplying.  If you can help your company go from 5 junior developers to 5 senior developers, you have created a massive output.  We are not good at measuring this and communicating it. \n\n* Suppose you want to write a script to automate something, and it will take 100 hours.   \n\n* Take what you make in the US per year multiply by 1.4 (creates fully loaded salary / cost to employer to include insurance and taxes, etc.).  For more specifics, ask your HR department. \n\n* Divide this by 2000 to account for approximate working hours in a year, and this gives an hourly rate. \n\n* If you spent 100 hours to write a script or to help someone else, now you know what the cost is to do it. \n\n* Now, find the cost of doing things before the change was implemented and the cost after.  This will help you determine the return on investment. \n\n* Think about yourself like a vendor providing a service to the company and what each action will return to the company. \n\n* If you want to move into a lead technical role to partially supervise / assist other people or move to management, part of the job is to build the team. \n\n* You are responsible for retention on the team and showing them a growth path. \n\n* To climb the ladder as a manager you need one hand on a rung holding yourself up and another reaching back to pull the team up behind you. \n\n* Your team is your only means of success. \n\n* Once you show someone you are building others up, you are far more likely to get a job as a manager.  But be that leader first.  Be that group builder. \n\n## 44:53 - Losing Tech Chops \n\n* Don got a VP job a couple of years ago and meant the end of his tech life (end of being Mr. PowerShell, end of the speaking engagements).  There wasn't time for things he used to do. \n\n* It's really hard because you are career switching.  People don't think of it that way. \n\n* If you're an accountant but want to become a lawyer, no one thinks they are going to miss their accounting skills.   \n\n* Going into management is taking on a new profession and requires you focus on it (walk away from old profession).  Time and energy need to be focused accordingly in all areas (trainings, books you read, conferences you attend). \n\n* You are going to lose your tech chops because you are going to gain management chops (new set of job skills to be proud of). \n\n* If you got into tech because you love messing with it, get a hobby. \n\n* Don loves writing.  He got to do a lot of writing before, but after moving into management, there was not room for it.  So he writes fiction.   \n\n* Don didn't have to walk away from something he loves.  He just has to conduct it outside of work now. \n\n* There's a company called Radford that specializes in IT salary data.  Most companies like this structure with pay bands, etc.  \n\n* A lower level manager will get paid the same as a higher level professional because the market places a premium on management skills (a different job family). \n\n* The worst thing you can do is take on a management job without realizing you are switching careers.  This can cause depression even. \n\n* Do it because you want to do that job.  The rat race aspect infuriates Don. \n\n* Special thanks to [Josh Duffney](https://twitter.com/joshduffney) for recommending we have Don on the show!  Catch the interviews we did with Josh here: [[Josh Duffney]]\n\n* [Episode 123 -

In today's episode we share part 2 of the interview with Don Jones.  We'll discuss the difference between job and career, developing people and owning your career, apprenticeship, and thoughts on time boxing.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-14-2021 \n\nDon Jones (find him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/concentrateddon/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/concentrateddon)) started in the tech industry in the 1990s, has [authored around 60 technical books](https://donjones.com/book-series/tech/), and is currently [Head of Developer Skills for Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/browse/software-development).  Catch part 1 of our interview with Don in [Episode 137](https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/).  \n\nTopics – Owning Your Tech Career, Job vs. Career and Developing People, Thoughts on Apprenticeship, Ampere Club, Time Boxing and Parting Thoughts  [[Don Jones]] [[Episode 137]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 4:03 - Owning Your Tech Career \n\n* In the first chapter of Don's book, he suggests defining what success looks like in your life (the kind of life you want to live outside of work, the type of job that offers this, etc.) and then charting a path to the success. [[Define Success]]\n\n* Re-evaluate as your life changes (get married, have a family, etc.). \n\n* Be ruthless about chasing the success, but once you get there stop.  Stop and enjoy it. \n\n* Most people don't think about an endpoint (get on staircase and never stop climbing). \n\n* Companies love to hire good individual contributors and turn them into managers because of the institutional knowledge those already on the inside have. \n\n* Understanding what is happening can help you figure out the best decision for you. \n\n* John mentions network is also a part of this. \n\n## 8:43 - Job vs. Career and Developing People \n\n* Don believes in the difference between job and career.  Your employer owns your job and needs to give you tools needed to do it.  [[Job vs. Career]]\n\n* You own your career.  It is the thing that will get you the next job.  You are in charge of its care and feeding. \n\n* Maybe you need to go take a class that has nothing to do with your job. \n\n* If your current company does not have a path for you to get promoted, get your career in shape to go to a company that does have that step.  This is all your responsibility. \n\n* Acquiring new talent is challenging for companies. \n\n* Don tells his people that if they outgrow the company, he will write the letter of recommendation for the next employer, wanting more for the person to achieve their own success. \n\n* \"Focus on it, chase it, and let me know how I can help get you there…even if it means you need to leave.\" - Don Jones  \n\n* This is leadership.  Not management \n\n* Not every organization has the natural next progression for you. \n\n* Bigger organizations have more rungs. \n\n* What if someone has a conversation with the boss about reaching a level and the boss says that level is not available here? \n\n* If you let Don know you need to grow and what success looks like, he is still looking at the people behind you that are more junior. \n\n* Listen to Don's story about the keyholder at Electronics Boutique and being able to do all the jobs, making it easy for him to advance. \n\n* Don is big on exposing team members to as much different experience and responsibility as they are interested in taking on.  If the opportunity comes up, the person will be ready. \n\n* One of the reasons we hate promoting people out of the company is hiring a replacement. \n\n* If I have done my job well as a manager, I have laddered out potential fills and hopefully only have to fill an entry level position (making it easier to hire folks). \n\n* Don thinks one way to support diversity is creating promotion chains that leave empty spots at the bottom, which allows bringing young people in. \n\n* If a manager is confident in upskilling the person, he / she can guide the individual wherever they want to go. \n\n* Don thinks a lot about succession planning and wants everyone to be ready to move up. \n\n* Asking your leader / manager to explain things in small words.  It's ok to do that and is good exposure for the team. \n\n* Don is a big proponent of asking the team for a recommendation, letting them modify it, and then saying \"yes, we will do what you suggested.\" \n\n* John likes this focus on team building, feeling like a Sales Engineer has to be more aligned with an organization's success metrics (that of your manager and the manager above that). \n\n* At the end of the day, Don loves teaching.  That's how he thinks about it. \n\n* For most of us, learning has been a push activity.  We're not encouraged to be curious so much as we are being told what to learn and being taught it. \n\n* It's similar in college.  Many of us do not develop professional curiosity. \n\n* Is lifelong learner the proper term to use for those who like learning?  Don thinks it is not. \n\n* Each day Don posts on Twitter something called inspiration for daily learning (usually a Wikipedia article that Don reads in 10-15 minutes). \n\n* This helps develop curiosity.  When you force the brain to be curious and force it to learn, it will be more curious and be better at learning. \n\n* When someone says something at work, maybe you'll get curious about it and turn learning into a push activity. \n\n* Listen to Don's story about people who said they wouldn't be able to utilize desired state configuration (DSC) back when he was teaching it. \n\n* A lack of curiosity can make it harder to learn something when you need to learn it.  If you condition your brain to learn daily, it will make learning easier. \n\n## 21:58 - Thoughts on Apprenticeship \n\n* John mentioned there's not a clear place to go in order to become an apprentice in a technology related field. \n\n* Some countries like Germany do a better job of baking in apprenticeship into their processes. \n\n* Don has worked with banks that hired people out of high school and trained them (i.e. the apprentice model). \n\n* The formal apprentice model exists in various trades. \n\n* There are two reasons we don't do apprenticeships in technology. \n\n* Very few companies know how to use learning as a tactical business tool (see it as overhead or as a fire drill).   \n\n* If anyone can learn to do something in tech, why not get really good at teaching the skills needed for specific aptitudes and hire for the diversity we want? \n\n* We hire for skills but can't teach someone to have a different cultural background. \n\n* If I know how to teach my people how to learn and they know how to learn, we can measure it. \n\n* Constant changing in tech requires constant learning.  If you're a learning company you can confidently teach skills, have some idea of how long it will take to do so, and manage the business in a better way. \n\n* Most companies don't do this well.  It's hard. \n\n* Don's answer might be the best Nick has ever heard to the age old question of \"why do we need to learn this?\" \n\n* Apprenticeships are long term investments.  The military invested millions of dollars to train Don and others.  We need longer term workforce thinking. \n\n* John mentioned the apprenticeship association with trades may class with the \"white collar\" job concept. \n\n* One of the people Don knows who makes the most money is a concrete contractor. \n\n* In the 1960s there was an idea that working a trade was somehow beneath everyone compared to the college track. \n\n* IT is a blue collar job.  White collar trades (medical / legal / banks) have apprenticeships. \n\n* We have interns, but an apprenticeship is a longer term commitment. \n\n* Instead of seeking an expensive piece of paper while going into debt, why not learn to code?   \n\n* Learn Java or C#, and you will get a job faster with little to no debt. \n\n* John mentions there is still a class barrier between jobs in the trades and other jobs. \n\n* Don mentioned we are seeing more companies turn to insourcing programs for gaining candidates with tech skills.   \n\n* Companies are finding that this is an investment but that the return is there.  Maybe the needle will swing in the other direction. \n\n* A lot of distortion in the labor market has come into view as a result of the pandemic. \n\n* People had over a year to breathe and decide what they want out of life.  Now they are starting to voice and demand those things. \n\n* People taking control of their careers and shaping the market will have a positive multi-generational effect. \n\n## 33:28 - Ampere Club \n\n* [Ampere Club](https://ampere.club/) is a project Don put together to help technology professionals interested in owning their career collect with likeminded people. \n\n* There is a free option to sign up for a monthly newsletter. \n\n* This is about building soft skills, building career skills, career management advice, and business acumen.  \n\n* The paid version is about $60 per year and gets you a weekly newsletter. \n\n* All content from newsletters is available on the Ampere Club site and equates to the amount of content in an entire book over the course of a year. \n\n* There is a virtual event taking place October 7-8, 2021 called [AmpNavigator](https://ampere.club/ampnavigator/) that is low cost ($50) and free for paid members to attend. \n\n* There are a couple of dozen speakers on tap, including representation from recruitment firms. \n\n* There will be a place to connect as well (i.e. a Slack space or something else). \n\n* Don is offering 1-1 career coaching also. \n\n* If you attend, take the advice you can use from the presenters. \n\n* Sometimes just asking a question is helping other people.   \n\n* An answer will come of that.  The conversation will be moved along as a result, and maybe it flipped a switch for someone listening. \n\n* John cites our participation in the [Spiceworks Community](https://community.spiceworks.com/) and the transition from question asker to question answerer. \n\n* Don cites the precursor to Own Your Tech Career, a book called Be the Master. \n\n* Don wrote a blog article back in 2017 called Be the Master or Go away.   \n\n* The idea here is every question you ask that is answered by someone else creates a debt…a debt for you to pay forward to someone else by contributing. \n\n* Get over the impostor syndrome, and get out there!  Many people start answering questions and get addicted to it. \n\n* Some folks end up running user groups, moderating forums, and coordinating community events…all because they answered that first question. \n\n* You're modeling to others that it is ok to make a mistake and ok to be wrong.  But you're modeling for them that it is ok to participate. \n\n* Maybe counting the number of likes / retweets, and spice ups isn't the proper measurement for our impact. \n\n* If the internet did not exist and you had the ability to help one kid learn something that eventually unlocked their life, would you do it? \n\n* It only takes one person to make it worth your time. \n\n* Amplifiers are worth more in an organization, and this is a huge part of your personal brand. \n\n* Hiring is a decision about inflicting a human being on a carefully curated team. \n\n* Don shares that hiring is incredibly hard. \n\n* Proof of work that you're someone who amplifies and helps others is what hiring managers want to see. \n\n* Community engagement is a tremendous part of your brand.  Start way before you need to leverage it. \n\n## 42:31 - Time Boxing and Parting Thoughts \n\n* Don time boxes his time for community participation.  He has a [time flip](https://timeflip.io/) device that helps him inventory where time is spent. \n\n* Don found that he preferred to eliminate Facebook time and focus on Q and A forum time.  This was how PowerShell.org was born. \n\n* Maybe you take 25-30 minutes to contribute and then move on to the next thing. \n\n* The danger for all of us is to think that a thing will bring us discipline. \n\n* The time flip is about inventorying reality.  Inventorying it lets you see what reality looks like and adjust (based on data). \n\n* Listen to how Don does this (find out first, choose to make a decision). \n\n* Don figured out spending around 1 hour building an outline for his novels was more productive than spending 2 hours building an outline. \n\n* In the writing process, writing mode and editing mode have to be different. \n\n* If Don is not in a writing mood one day, he chooses to do something else (which is why he has 3-4 projects going). \n\n* John suggests having Don back to discuss the transition for people who are looking to add something to their plate how they can progress to blogger or content developer. \n\n* On [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/concentrateddon/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/concentrateddon), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/concentrateddon), Don is @concentrateddon.  His main website is [donjones.com](https://donjones.com/).  [Ampere Club](https://ampere.club/) is his career project.  \n\n* Go get your copy of [Own Your Tech Career](https://www.manning.com/books/own-your-tech-career), which was recently released by Don. \n\n* Check out [Episode 45 -

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Eric Brooker, covering topics such as getting into sales, accepting others' no, and progression into sales leadership.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 7-20-2021 \n\nTopics – Getting into #Sales, When No Means No, Performance Issues and Doing the Right Things, Sales as an Element of Many Areas, Individual Contributor to Leader, Interaction up the Leadership Chain [[Eric Brooker]] #BigleafNetworks\n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:02 - Meet [Eric Brooker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericbrooker/) \n\n* Eric and his wife have 7 children and live near St. Paul Minnesota.  Eric has been in tech sales / tech sales leadership for about 21 years and currently works for Bigleaf Networks.  \n\n* Eric says he currently works with some of the best people he's ever worked with in all his years. \n\n## 3:25 - Getting into Sales \n\n* Eric has interviewed a number of people going into the sales profession. \n\n* If you can get past the 4 letter word that is sales and be comfortable in your own skin, there is a lot of upside. \n\n* When Eric was 20 and his wife was pregnant with their first child, it was all about the money and a chance to make a financial advancement in his career. \n\n* Eric had not finished college, and it was time to \"grow up.\"  He had a plan for his wife to stay at home, and in order to do that, there were sacrifices needed. \n\n* Stepping into sales was kind of in his blood with his parents both owning their own business. \n\n* He found himself successful with the support of a number of great sales leaders who told him what to do and how to do it.  Eric learned if he would do what they told him to do, he was going to be successful. \n\n* Eric eventually grew into a sales leader himself, wanting to give back see others succeed as he did. \n\n* For Eric, the idea of sitting back at a retail facility and waiting for someone to come to him was not what he wanted.  He wanted to go out and get the business. \n\n* Very early in his career, this meant door-to-door sales.  In order to build trust with businesses, you have to do it. \n\n* One Monday he would have conversations and collect business cards followed by making calls on Tuesday, trying to earn that next customer. \n\n* This was not easy because Eric was young.  So many of his friends were out partying. \n\n* Eric stayed motivated by that vision of his wife staying at home with the kids, which she has been able to do for his entire career in sales. \n\n* Sales is not for the week at heart. \n\n* Month after month there are sales goals and objectives.  You can knock it out of the park in June, and then July 1st hits, forcing you to do it all over again. \n\n* It's a lot of work, and it's a lot of fun when it's rewarding.   \n\n* Eric has seen many people succeed over the years, which brings him joy just the same. \n\n* Are there certain personality types better suited for sales? \n\n* Some of this is a learned behavior.  No one really likes rejection. \n\n* Eric has the ability to just \"move on\" after getting a no despite wanting a yes.  He has rarely if ever taken it personally. \n\n* No one has ever not done business with Eric Brooker because they didn't like him as a person.  It was that they did not need his product or service or were unable to make a change at the time. \n\n* You're going to get no's as a salesperson. \n\n* The extrovert may find success a little easier. \n\n* When people ask Eric how he does what he does, Eric says he feels he is not doing anything different than just being himself. \n\n* An introvert can be as successful as an extrovert and must be able to handle rejection. \n\n* It's possible the introvert who is more detail oriented may be better suited for the complex sale.   \n\n* Eric has found a niche that works well for him from a sales and sales leadership perspective. \n\n* Eric feels like anyone can to anything they want if they truly set their mind to it. \n\n* For Eric, growing professionally has been about reading a lot of books. \n\n* If you're not a salesperson by nature, go pick up some books, and give it a whirl.   \n\n* As of this recording, we are living through [the great resignation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonwingard/2021/09/02/the-great-resignation-why-gen-z-is-leaving-the-workforce-in-drovesand-what-to-do-about-it/).  Many are working from home and realizing they no longer like what they do and are looking to get into something different. [[Great Resignation]]\n\n* Try something new.  Now is the time.  Everyone out there is looking to do something different. \n\n* Nick and Eric talk about loving Audible.  Nick cannot listen on faster than 1.0.  Eric says he's usually at 1.6 or 1.7, stopping to take notes here and there. \n\n* One of the best sales books Eric has read is [Proactive Selling](https://www.amazon.com/ProActive-Selling-Control-Process-Sale/dp/0814407641) by [[Skip Miller]].  [[Proactive Selling]]\n\n\t* It covers a lot of the basics like how to leave a voicemail, how to get someone to help you, how to get someone to return your call / e-mail. \n\n\t* Eric was forced to read it in 2012 and eventually met Skip Miller in 2013. \n\n\t* Another good one by Skip is [Selling above and below the Line](https://www.amazon.com/Selling-Above-Below-Line-Management/dp/0814434835).  [[Selling Above and Below the Line]]\n\n## 13:06 - When No Means No \n\n* How do you know when #NoMeansNo and not to press any harder? \n\n* Eric says peer reviews help.  Many of his team members come to the team call or to a 1-1 to share details of a win they are expecting in the near term.  Another member of the team will act as a non-biased observer. \n\n* When you have a good relationship with people, you can ask the questions they are not thinking of to help them find potential issues.  \"I don't think you'll win that deal, and here's why.\" \n\n* Think honest conversations with yourself, your boss, etc. \n\n* Skip Miller says the yeses are great and the no's are great.  But the maybes will kill you. \n\n* If someone says maybe, a salesperson is going to keep following up with them. \n\n* If something is definitively a no, be honest with yourself about it, and just move on.  That is better than trying to salvage something you were never going to win. \n\n* People don't want to say no.   \n\n* Listen to the story about Eric's first boss and his take on people saying no. \n\n* We don't give customers the opportunity to say no.  We make it awkward. \n\n* Value your time.  Give them the opportunity to say yes, and by giving them the opportunity to say yes, you're affording them the opportunity to say no.  \n\n* People are timid in saying no, and it's incumbent upon us to meet them where they are.  If we know they won't say no over the phone, send an e-mail.  Give them the opportunity to say no. \n\n* Eric doesn't like doing business via text, but he will say no via text. \n\n* If you're a voice communication person, pick up the phone.  If the person prefers face-to-face, try to accommodate that. \n\n* Listen to Eric's perspective on people saying no to relationships. \n\n* John mentions a sales leader who shared it took them too long to lose deals. \n\n* Eric mentioned this happens because we're not honest with ourselves.  Be honest with yourself and your boss about what is accurate (whether good or bad). \n\n## 18:10 - Performance Issues and Doing the Right Things \n\n* How long can producing an accurate picture of business be ok for a sales rep before they get pressured to \"step up?\" \n\n* We are in a people business, regardless of your role and industry (engineer, bagger at grocery store, etc.).  People are going through life. \n\n* One of the things Eric has learned to do before telling someone they are bad at their job or having an uncomfortable conversation is be empathetic and care. Know what is going on in people's lives. \n\n* Listen to Eric's story of his boss's empathy toward him after losing a family member (i.e. caring well for your employees). \n\n* Sales in large part is an activity game.  It's a matter of doing enough activity to get enough results and figuring out what that activity is each and every month, quarter, year to hit and exceed goals. \n\n* Eric shares a story from when he thought he was on the brink of being fired, but his boss actually told him he was doing all the right things, knowing that the results would come. \n\n* Eric mentioned this happened because his boss took the time to get to know him and understood what he was going through. \n\n* This reminds John of [[Annie Duke]]'s book [Thinking in Bets](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-in-Bets-Annie-Duke-audiobook/dp/B078SBSBW3). [[Thinking in Bets]]\n\n* Control the activities within your control (number of calls you make, etc.), and focus on the right activities. \n\n* There is some chance involved as there are things outside of our control.  But by controlling the things you can control the tide will eventually turn in your favor. \n\n* Maybe we see sales as more outcome / results oriented than other professions because the metrics are easily shown? \n\n* If you're a developer, you should have deadlines for others to see whether you are meeting the deadliness. \n\n* It's similar in customer service.  There are certain metrics involved. \n\n* Sales is the one that often times generates the bulk of the revenue of the company.  When sales are down, everyone notices. \n\n* Eric thinks everyone's job needs to be managed in a similar fashion. He'd love to see a customer service scoreboard or a development scoreboard and whether we hit the last metrics. \n\n* In sales we get a lot of visibility, but in any job, success and failure are 100% measurable. \n\n* Dollars are extremely measurable, and other metrics may be more difficult to come by / seem more ephemeral. \n\n## 24:02 - Sales as an Element of Many Areas \n\n* This reminds John of the movie [Boiler Room](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181984/).  [[Boiler Room]]\n\n* Almost every job involves some facet of sales.   \n\n* Customer service has to sell the fact that someone's problem will be solved by specific expertise / recommended series of actions. \n\n* If you're an architect, you are trying to sell someone on your ideas about how a system / solution / building is being architected, convincing them to go in your direction. \n\n* \"Do you want fries with that?\" is an upsell.  It's the same at the car wash. \n\n* Nick reaching out to Eric about being on the podcast was a sales call. \n\n* When Eric first got into sales he had some shame.  He owns it now. \n\n* Interviewing for a job is one of the best sales jobs of your entire life.  You are selling the hiring manager on the fact that you are without question the best candidate.  You're walking in there to have a sales conversation about a non-sales related role. \n\n* You need to approach your career / yourself as a product you are selling.  Don't you want the deluxe version? [[Selling Yourself as a Product]]\n\n* John cites talking to your boss about you version 2.0 instead of 1.0 and what that nets the company.  It's also a nice way to ask for a raise.   \n\n* Right now employees have the upper hand in nearly every environment.  Qualified, experienced people are hard to come by.  There should be no shame in asking for a raise if you are good at what you do and the company values you for it. \n\n* Read books.  Go to seminars and conferences to make yourself better.  You are going to stand out from the people at the same company who get in at 8:05 AM and leave at 4:50 PM. \n\n## 28:35 - Individual Contributor to Leader \n\n* Eric thinks several years ago moving into leadership was about the prestige, about doing something he had not done before, and the extra money. \n\n* Eric's boss did not promote him into leadership on the first opportunity to do so, and it was difficult for Eric to accept. \n\n* Eric was one of the most successful people in the company and had begun mentoring others.  His boss told him \"you're not ready yet.\" \n\n* Eric's first management stint was quite difficult.  He was everyone's friend at the office and wanted to continue to be, but that was not his job any longer.  It was to do everything in his power to make his employees successful and to support them. \n\n* He started off thinking that people reported to him and would do what he asked when he asked them to do it, but it was just the opposite. \n\n* Right now Eric supports a team of 7 and looks at it very differently.  He functions to remove any and all obstacles that may get in their way, to run appointments with them when crisis his, and do whatever is needed to support them…which includes coaching them. \n\n* Out of the gates Eric took the job for the prestige and the money and was not successful but was fortunate to have a second chance at sales leadership (as well as some great mentors along the way). \n\n* Leadership is not for everyone. \n\n* We have a tendency in small business to take a person who is successful in their role and seek to promote them into management (without taking time to get to know what that person wants and if it aligns with their [[Career Goals]]).   \n\n* This is often because the person has hit the top of the pay scale and is really good at what they do. Just because you have mastered the role / skillset does not mean you're the next obvious choice to take on the managerial role.  [[Managing People is a Different Skill Set Than Being an Individual Contributor]]\n\n* Eric mentions having some great mentors that taught him what it means to be a leader.  He did not just happen to fall into it. \n\n* \"Out of the gates I was successful in my role.  People didn’t know what to do with me, so they just made me a manager.\" - Eric Brooker \n\n* Nick recalls hearing someone say recently they didn't need to be as good at the job as a fellow individual contributor to be that person's manager. \n\n* Eric thinks it starts with empathy.  Before striving for the promotion / the money, do a gut check to ask yourself if it's something you want and if you will be good at it. \n\n* Can I shift from being someone's friend to being their boss? \n\n* As the boss, you get to hire people, and you get to promote people. \n\n* You also have to have really uncomfortable conversations with people, put them on performance plans, work with HR to help people exit the business. \n\n* The toughest day of Eric's professional career is when he's had to terminate somoene.   #Firing\n\n* When you have a tough conversation with someone, you have to document it.  Some people just aren't cut out for it, and that's ok. \n\n* As an individual contributor, you don't have to do any of this. \n\n* Eric really enjoys helping people and loves watching people succeed. \n\n* There are times where he looks at people and thinks they are so much better than they are in their current state. \n\n* Eric has to help people realize they might be better at the role than he ever was (despite the fact that they have not yet identified it). \n\n* John O'Leary was recently on Eric's podcast, Counsel Culture (formerly The New Norm).  Catch the episode [here](https://www.ericbrooker.com/podcast/episode/453d6023/48-a-life-inspired-with-john-oleary). [[Counsel Culture]] [[John O'Leary]]\n\n* John has written some excellent books like [In Awe](https://www.amazon.com/Awe-Rediscover-Childlike-Unleash-Inspiration/dp/B085VNH13B) and [On Fire](https://www.amazon.com/On-Fire-John-O-Leary-audiobook/dp/B01B6WVE5U), and he speaks to living a life of significance over a life of success. [[In Awe]] [[On Fire]]\n\n* Eric finds significance in helping other people achieve their goals and find the success they've always dreamed of but haven't found just yet. \n\n* Eric doesn't get as many opportunities to interact with customers these days, but he does miss it. \n\n* Eric is afforded opportunities to help his people, but it's not his job to be the salesperson.  He needs to afford them to do their job.    \n\n* Even when Eric does sit on one of the calls with customers he does not fee like he does a whole lot other than help the customer understand the company is bigger than just the one salesperson the customer has interacted with to this point. \n\n* Eric may be talking to his people about the sales calls, but he is not in the trenches daily like they are. \n\n* Eric tries to be respectful of the fact that the customer's relationship is with the salesperson.  The worst thing a leader can do is walk in and act like they are different or better than the salesperson. \n\n* The reason Eric gets to sit in the room is because the salesperson got that meeting, and Eric can later offer some coaching for the salesperson if needed as a result. \n\n## 37:54 - The Interaction up the Leadership Chain \n\n* Eric says he doesn't think it's a lot different.  Instead of talking to his boss about forecasted sales he will close for the month, he is rolling up the forecast for his team. \n\n* The conversations tend to be more driven by strategy of organization and how they can grow the sales organization (revenue, maybe headcount, etc.). \n\n* Do we have the right methodology? \n\n* Do we have the right product? \n\n* Eric misses being out in the field. There are days on end when he's having strategy conversations with company founders, but he would rather be out having sales conversations. \n\n* He recognizes that when done right, he can help move the needle for his entire team through the proper strategy. \n\n* The day-to-day may look different, but the overall objectives are the same.  His objectives are the total team objectives. \n\n* Going to the founders and sharing that the team didn't hit the numbers is far more uncomfortable than telling your boss you missed your number as an individual contributor. \n\n* Eric references [Love is Free, Guac is Extra](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Free-Guac-Extra-Vulnerability-ebook/dp/B08DT4HBRV) by [[Monty Moran]], former CEO of Chipotle.  #Chipotle [[Love is Free. Guac is Extra]]\n\n* Catch Eric's interview with Monty [here](https://www.ericbrooker.com/podcast/episode/29848b4c/37-love-is-free-guac-is-extra-with-former-co-ceo-of-chipotle-monty-moran). \n\n* Monty asks great questions and is wildly transparent.  If you ask him a question you are going to get the answer. \n\n* Eric likes to give things to people the way they really are (i.e. the team is not in a position to have a good month but will be doing these things to put ourselves in the best possible situation).  He has a tendency to have those tough conversations early. \n\n* Salespeople seem to want to avoid the hard conversations until very late in the game because they didn't have an honest conversation with themselves.  Once we are honest with ourselves, we can have honest conversations with others.   \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-14":{"title":"Episode 14","content":"\n# Episode 14\n\nTopics \n\n3:21 What was the ramp-up to the decision to become an entrepreneur? \n\n-   The E-Myth - Gerber \n    \n    -   [https://michaelegerbercompanies.com/web/the-e-myth-library/](https://michaelegerbercompanies.com/web/the-e-myth-library/) \n        \n    -   \"The entrepreneurial seizure\" \n        \n-   It happened at the end of summer 2016, \"Could think about doing this\" \n    \n-   Leadup was organic \n    \n    -   User community involvement \n        \n    -   Giving back to the community \n        \n    -   Presentations and sessions \n        \n    -   The high of helping other people \n        \n-   Tom gives the example of a Shipping \u0026 Receiving Project that made a real impact. \n    \n-   Nick  shares his memory of the projects and how the volume continued to increase as the department added value. \n    \n-   The more successful projects they completed, the more Tom wanted to share it with the community. \n    \n    -   Some current clients saw him do a user-group presentation 4 years earlier \n        \n    -   Those presentations were focused on merely giving back. \n        \n    -   Tom presented at Epicor's national conference for 8 years straight. \n        \n    -   From time to time, he got asked to moonlight. \n        \n    -   Other consulting orgs tried to recruit him \n        \n    -   Tom loved his organization and had no desire to work for someone else / start over at a different org \n        \n-   Tom knew there was no \"next step\" for him to take in the business \n    \n    -   This realization was the entrepreneurial seizure \n        \n    -   Input from friends / family / trusted advisors only confirmed going out on his own was the logical next step \n        \n\n13:07 John's observation about IT Operations aligning with the business and articulating impacts \n\n-   Selling the good ideas the right way \n    \n-   Tom emphasized the person who is often hardest to convince but perhaps the biggest decision maker is the CFO \n    \n-   John thought of IT as below the line as opposed to above the line dollars \n    \n-   Tom stressed the idea of thinking like a manufacturer because of his client base \n    \n\n18:29 What challenges were helped by IT skills \n\n-   Tom stresses that technology isn't always the answer. \n    \n-   Can the organization and the people involved handle the amount of change being proposed? \n    \n-   The 95% solution might be simpler than the 100% solution \n    \n-   Edge cases can be complex \n    \n-   A business focused on process orientation is better than relying on people as experts. \n    \n-   An analog process for an edge case can be better than a tech solution \n    \n-   At the core, how creatively can you solve this problem? \n    \n-   Tech solutions can be \n    \n    -   Too expensive \n        \n    -   Too time intensive to implement \n        \n    -   Too much of a change in process for the people involved \n        \n\n24:06 Knowing what you know now, what skills were you missing?

In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Eric Brooker, covering topics such as disconnecting, being present, and Eric's experiences in podcasting.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 7-20-2021 \n\n[Eric Brooker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericbrooker/) is a veteran in tech sales (experience of over 20 years) and has progressed from individual contributor to sales leader.  Check out part 1 of our interview with him in [Episode 139](https://nerd-journey.com/honest-conversations-and-empathy-with-eric-brooker-1-2/).  [[Eric Brooker]] [[Episode 139]]\n\nTopics – Taking Time Away, Disconnect and Focus, Eric's Podcast, Closing Thoughts \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:02 - Taking Time Away \n\n* Eric is 41 and has been in tech sales for 21 years.  He and his wife like to travel, but they have always traveled to visit family. \n\n* They had never taken a vacation just the 9 of them (Eric, his wife, and their 7 children) until recently.  They visited Lake of the Ozarks. \n\n* The podcast Eric hosts ([Counsel Culture, formerly The New Norm](https://www.ericbrooker.com/podcast)) is all about culture and leadership. [[Counsel Culture]]\n\n* Every company out there talks about the amazing culture they have, even the really bad ones. \n\n* There are few companies out there that really strive to have a great culture (may not have one but strive for one). \n\n* Eric has been with his current employer for 2 years now.  They are great people.  They do everything they say they are going to do (a bit of a cultural anomaly in Eric's industry). \n\n* Eric's wife helped him realize they had never done a vacation with just their family.  So she sold him on the idea of taking a week off for just such an endeavor. \n\n* Eric has 6 bead jars that sit at his desk with a specific number of beads in each, which decreases each week, representing the number of weeks he has left with his kids before they turn 18. \n\n* This trick was taught to Eric by a former Disney executive. \n\n* Every Saturday morning an alarm goes off, reminding Eric to take a bead out of each jar and reflect on the week before (how present he was to the kids).  It's a reminder to him to be present and that there is only so much time left with the kids. \n\n* Eric decided if he's taking a week off, he should probably NOT work. What does not working mean? \n\n* He was fortunate enough to not have a cellular connection at Lake of the Ozarks (a big reason it was a great vacation).  But Eric wanted to do more to make sure he would be present. \n\n* Eric called his boss and said he had made a conscious decision to delete e-mail from his phone. \n\n* During the vacation, Eric was more present with his family than he had ever been, owed no one anything, and really enjoyed it. \n\n* No one needed him for an entire week, and if they did, it was going to have to wait until he got back. \n\n* No one died, nothing catastrophic happened, and the world went on. \n\n* We often think the company will fall apart if we're away, and that is simply not what happened in Eric's case.  \n\n* Eric was present to his kids.  They did so many fun things hanging out with one another that they will remember for many years to come. \n\n* Eric is almost angry at himself for waiting this long (i.e. starting at age 41) to disconnect. \n\n* Even if you are single, take the week to be present to yourself, and take e-mail off your phone. \n\n* Eric's company was incredibly supportive. \n\n* Eric plans to do this once per year moving forward. \n\n## 10:02 - Disconnect and Focus \n\n* If your boss is not ok with you taking a week off work and not actually working, you work for the wrong person or at the wrong company. \n\n* Eric is confused as to why he's never done this before now. \n\n* None of us really disconnect when we take time off.  We have our cell phones, our e-mail, etc. \n\n* Thirty years ago, this is how we took time off (mostly total disconnection). \n\n* Eric's dad will go missing in action for a week on end, and Eric won't hear from him much. \n\n* Early on in this, Eric would ask \"what if something happens to you?\"  His dad would say \"either way you're going to find out I'm already dead.\" \n\n* Horrible things have the potential to happen whether we are connected or disconnected.  Why not just take the time off and be present? \n\n* You will never get the time back.  Eric recalls stepping out on a family vacation for half a day to resolve a customer issue.  Why would he do that? \n\n* John says sometimes it is ego (i.e. \"I need to be the one to handle this\"). \n\n* Someone else can fix it.  You're on vacation. \n\n* The other is the martyr's viewpoint.  When all is said and done we want to be able to say how much we've bled for the company. \n\n* Eric thinks this may be the reason he took half a day in Boston to deal with a customer issue. \n\n* Whatever the issue is, it is unlikely we are the only one who can fix it and perhaps even more unlikely that we would need to stop everything and handle it regardless of where we are and what we are doing. \n\n* Eric wishes he had taken this time once or twice per year as a gift to himself and to his family. \n\n* Sometimes we may fear that if we don't do it (handle the problem), someone else will do it, and that will impact our ability to be promoted. \n\n* As a sales leader, the more admirable thing is to be present to your family and to be more present in life. \n\n* There are also those who are addicted to responsiveness.  They feel like they cannot close down e-mail even for a couple of hours. \n\n* Some of the most successful people Eric has met check their e-mail only a couple of times per day.  This has created a behavior for internal / external customers of this specific executive. \n\n* We think the sky is going to fall if we don't respond to that e-mail or return that call. \n\n* John cites the core lesson as being present.  Even checking e-mail a couple of times per day is about being present and focusing on a single task. \n\n* Most technologies today are setup to distract you. \n\n* If you can't trust yourself to be present with your family can you really trust yourself to be focused on the job? \n\n* Eric has been working to be more present at work (i.e. shutting down e-mail to be on a call, focus on a task, etc.). \n\n* How often have we been on the receiving end of someone affirming what we've just said (not in a meaningful way but because they were distracted)?  We know that person was not listening.  How often today were you that person? \n\n* The hardest thing to do in life is to be present.  You can turn your phone over so you cannot see the screen, turn it off, or put it in a drawer to focus on what you're doing. \n\n* If your job is so important that you cannot miss a call, text, or e-mail you probably have an executive assistant.  Tell that person to only walk into your office / buzz you when it's hair on fire. \n\n* Are you willing to set do not disturb on your phone during meetings, turn it upside to keep it from ringing, or block off parts of your calendar for do not disturb? \n\n* These are systems to help you focus. \n\n* Eric says you can even set an alarm on your phone to help. \n\n* He is currently in the process of writing a book (just started) and uses a 30-minute window before work for streams of thought related to the book.  There is nothing wrong with scheduling time for tasks like this. \n\n* This reminds Nick of [[Josh Duffney]]'s efforts to focus that we discussed in [Episode 124](https://nerd-journey.com/focus-create-and-iterate-with-josh-duffney-2-2/) and that he needs to re-read [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) by [[Cal Newport]]. [[Deep Work]] [[Episode 124]] \n\n* Many times prolific thinkers and authors would disconnect or go somewhere else to do tasks requiring extreme focus. \n\n* For Eric, it's working on a book.  For others it may be spending 30 minutes with kids before they leave for school each day. \n\n* It starts by figuring out what your priorities are in life. \n\n* Eric says his priority is family but wanted to make sure his actions are in alignment with what he is saying. \n\n* Nick set a goal to write a blog for his daughter weekly.  And before he set the goal he was not doing it consistently.  He found after setting the goal it was easy to do and sometimes results in 2 posts per week. \n\n* If you tell people about what you plan to do, it is more likely to happen (the accountability factor). \n\n## 25:35 - Eric's Podcast \n\n* Eric got a phone call about a year ago from [[Tanner Brock]] asking him to come on a podcast to discuss a few things. \n\n* The discussion was on culture and leadership, something Eric is very passionate about. \n\n* This comes from a horrible job Eric had a number of years ago where he was run into the ground emotionally. \n\n* The motivation to start the podcast was getting sucked into what looked like a great culture on paper but really wasn't. \n\n* It was not about Eric.  It was about the company's bottom line and Eric not taking vacation time or focusing on his family, feeling the company was working people to death. \n\n* Eric did not want others to make the same mistake. \n\n* The podcast is about creating a new norm in our lives about culture and leadership.  It's about taking a leadership role in our own lives. \n\n* The name of the show at the time of the recording was The New Norm but has recently rebranded to Counsel Culture.  Full details on the podcast can be found [here](https://www.ericbrooker.com/podcast). [[Counsel Culture]]\n\n* There have been a number of incredible guests such as the former CE of Chipotle, the VP of Talent at Chick-Fil-A, executives from Twitter and Disney, and folks like [John O'Leary](https://www.ericbrooker.com/podcast/episode/453d6023/48-a-life-inspired-with-john-oleary) and [Jason Schechterle](https://www.ericbrooker.com/podcast/episode/24168dfd/39-burning-shield-the-story-of-jason-schechterle).  [[John O'Leary]] [[Jason Schechterle]]\n\n* Jason was a 26-year-old police officer rear-ended by a taxi cab going 120 miles per hour, and it changed his life.  Listen to more details of the story from Eric. \n\n* The podcast has been a lot of fun and has really stretched Eric, releasing weekly on Tuesdays. \n\n* He originally committed to 75 episodes and is pretty close to that mark now.  With all the fun and success he is having he plans to keep going.    \n\n* Nick and John talk about how many episodes they felt they could get in the beginning. \n\n* Someone told Eric most podcasts don't get to 10 episodes, so he immediately set a goal to get to 25. \n\n* Eric is reading about a book per week to try and keep up with his podcast guests.  It forces him to grow and mature as a person and allows him to share unbelievable conversations with people, which makes him want to keep doing it. \n\n* Why should we learn things the hard way when we can learn from other people's experiences?   \n\n* The technology is such that you don't have to go through the hassle of reading a 300 page book.  You could find a 40-minute podcast and learn from subject matter experts. \n\n* John likes the idea of transmitting knowledge via some kind of broadcast medium (podcast, blog, video, etc.).  What kind of feedback has Eric received to continue to work on his podcast? \n\n* Any guest Eric gets to speak with is a guest he might not have had the change to talk to otherwise. \n\n* Eric got to know the founder of Self Esteem Brands (which encompasses Anytime Fitness) who happens to live just a few minutes away from him, a relationship Eric otherwise would not have forged. #SelfEsteemBrands #AnytimeFitness\n\n* The conversations about episodes with listeners have been very enriching. \n\n* Listen to Eric's story about someone asking to be a guest on his show to discuss a 3-year recovery from alcohol #addiction. \n\n* A large number of people reached out to Eric about the impact listening to the conversation had on them (like the person Eric knew from church who has been sober for 350 days but was going to drink to celebrate and decided against it after listening to the podcast).   \n\n* There is so much information you can get from spending 15-30 minutes daily listening to someone else's experience. \n\n* Catch the full interview with Michael Gallagher [here](https://www.ericbrooker.com/podcast/episode/26ec0025/15-alcoholism-addiction-and-meditation-with-michael-gallagher). \n\n* How can we be more meaningful and intentional in our actions every day?  Think about it. \n\n* John cites the theme of being present, being focused, and doing things intentionally. \n\n* Eric cites a Disney executive who used to open and close conversations with \"happy present moment.\" \n\n* We're in such a rush to get to the next thing. Be happy in the present moment because you are there for a reason. \n\n* People are transmitting what their values are, etc. to you in the present moment. \n\n## 38:33 - Closing Thoughts \n\n* The worst thing Eric has ever done is get impatient.  He was looking for success faster than he needed to, thinking a year into a role he had earned the right to get a promotion or the role as manager. \n\n* Eric would get mad and wouldn't be patient, often times leaving the company. \n\n* Be patient.  The grass is not always greener on the other side, even though we think it is.   \n\n* Eric wishes he had been more patient, feeling he had missed out on opportunities in front of him even though things were not easy at the moment. \n\n* [Bobby Dysart](https://www.ericbrooker.com/podcast/episode/23a08063/35-student-of-intention-with-bobby-dysart) said \"don't wait, start small, learn as you go.\"  So many of us are waiting to gather all the info to write the book.  Just take the first step. [[Bobby Dysart]]\n\n* John recommends checking out the [Deep Questions Podcast](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/) from [[Cal Newport]].

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we begin a book discussion of Deep Work by Cal Newport.  We'll help listeners understand what deep work is, why we should do it (based on the book), and share our reactions.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 09-26-2021 \n\nTopics – Show Format, Overall Reactions to the Book, Introduction to the Deep Work Hypothesis, Chapter 1 - Deep Work is Valuable, Chapter 2 - Deep Work is Rare, Chapter 3 - Deep Work is Meaningful \n\n=========================== \n\n## 0:55 - Today's Show Format \n\n* This week we're doing a book review episode on [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) by Cal Newport.   This will be only part 1 and aligns with part 1 of the book.   [[Deep Work]] [[Cal Newport]] #Georgetown\n\n* The book was referenced in [Episode 108](https://nerd-journey.com/2021-book-goals-from-nick-and-john/), our 2021 book goals, and in [Episode 124](https://nerd-journey.com/focus-create-and-iterate-with-josh-duffney-2-2/) with [[Josh Duffney]].  [[Episode 108]] [[Episode 124]]\n\n* For previous book reviews we've done see these episodes: \n\n* [Episode 87](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-lencionis-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/) - Book Discussion: Lencioni’s “The Five Dysfunctions of a Team” [[Episode 87]] [[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team]] [[Patrick Lencioni]]\n\n* [Episode 90](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-the-inner-game-of-stress-by-gallwey-hanzelik-and-horton/) - Book Discussion: The Inner Game of Stress by Gallwey, Hanzelik, and Horton [[Episode 90]] [[The Inner Game of Stress]]\n\n* Cal Newport is a computer science professor at Georgetown and has published several books including [[Digital Minimalism]], [[So Good They Can't Ignore You]], and Deep Work (full list can be found [here](https://www.calnewport.com/books/)).   \n\n* He has also started a podcast called [Deep Questions](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/) that is quite good, often giving advice based on listener questions from his books. [[Deep Questions]]\n\n* At this point John has listed to about 40 of the episodes (in chronological order). \n\n* The format of this show will be as follows: \n\n* John and Nick will give reactions to the book overall. \n\n* Then we will go back and react to each chapter, answer questions like \n\n* Do I believe this? \n\n* Does this apply to me? \n\n* Does it make me want to change behavior? \n\n* What will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n## 5:39 - Overall Reactions to the Book \n\n* John \n\n* He found the book compelling, felt the hypothesis was valid.  Once he started reading it was difficult to stop. \n\n* John says the book definitely applies to him.  Unless you concentrate on removing distraction, it is so easy to let it creep into your professional life.  John felt like every description of a behavior was talking about him. \n\n* It definitely makes John want to change.  In fact, he wanted to make changes as soon as possible (very compelling).  \n\n* John has already started reorganizing how he works, what can interrupt him, and how he scheduled his time.  \n\n* Focusing your attention and not getting sidetracked is very difficult. \n\n* Nick \n\n* When Nick thinks about past guests, he believes they have done deep work in some form or another, even if they didn't call it deep work. \n\n* Newport is attacking all the things Nick is doing wrong, and it is easy to see that he's way too connected. \n\n* Nick wants to change his behavior as well. \n\n* Nick has turned off e-mail notifications on his desktop and all sounds for new e-mail received. \n\n* We chose this book because we both read it, both had strong positive reactions, and started to think about how the suggestions could change our professional careers for the better.  We hope the suggestions can help you too! \n\n* The book is about digital transformation but not in the way we normally mean it in the tech industry. \n\n## 10:36 - Introduction to the Deep Work Hypothesis \n\n* The book's introduction formalizes the definition of deep work. \n\n\u003e Deep Work: \"Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.\" \n\n\u003e Shallow Work: \"Non-cognitively demanding tasks that are often done while distracted which are easy to replicate and do not create a lot of value in the world\" \n\n\u003e The Deep Work Hypothesis: \"The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.\" \n\n* You can be more valuable as worker if you are able to perform deep work. \n\n* Reactions \n\n* John \n\n* John believes that work demanding high levels of cognitive function is most correlated with high value / what employers are willing to pay for.  You can control how well you are able to perform really difficult tasks requiring extreme focus. \n\n* I'm sure there are exceptions.  You can control how effectively you work. \n\n* John finds himself being asked to do work that seems more administrative than deep and cognitive.  He finds it challenging to understand how the shallow work items contribute to the success of his job.  This is across the board with jobs John has had over time, making him want to focus on the deep stuff. \n\n* There are unspoken expectations to reply to e-mail quickly, for example. \n\n* The crowding in of highly distracted administrative work over the work that correlates long term with success as an employee makes John want to change.  He wants to be a high value worker. \n\n* John hasn't kept up an active blog.  He wonders what has kept him from doing that and feels it is in line with professional growth. \n\n* John plans to do what he can to maximize the deep work and concentrate the shallow work into an organized fashion.  He'll have to figure out how the deep work is measurably aligned with success in the work place and do more of it. \n\n* Nick \n\n* When you see people make breakthroughs / reaching high levels, they have done deep work in some form.  They had periods where they needed to concentrate deeply and make a big enough impact, adding knowledge to their field. \n\n* Sometimes because of the number of e-mails / tasks on your plate the shallow things end up getting in the way of what we should really be doing (the deep work). \n\n* Nick thinks back to all the quality outcomes that happen for people doing the deep work, and he wants more of it. \n\n* You can't do deep work 100% of the time.  It is cognitively impossible.  Nick feels he needs to take more time dedicated to focus, inserting more guardrails on protecting this time. \n\n## 19:52 - Chapter 1 - Deep Work is Valuable \n\n* Technology is displacing human labor when that labor is used in a way that is easily automated (often called \"The Great Restructuring\").   \n\n* Three groups to benefit from the restructuring \n\n* Highly skilled workers \n\n* Superstars (at tops of their fields) \n\n* Owners \n\n* These people have access to capital to fund the development.  We cannot control this aspect of capital to invest, so the book focuses on the first two groups. \n\n* Core abilities to thrive in this new economy \n\n* \"The ability to quickly master hard things\"  \n\n*  \"The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed\" \n\n* Newport makes points that deep work both helps you quickly learn hard things and produce at an elite level. \n\n* John dives into what each of these mean, referencing Newport's citing of Dan Coyle's [The Talent Code](http://danielcoyle.com/the-talent-code/).  [[The Talent Code]] [[Dan Coyle]]\n\n* Do you have \"attention residue\" from changing tasks too often? \n\n* Are there counterexamples to this?  Listen to John share Newport's thoughts on high level executives and their ability / lack of ability to do deep work. \n\n* Reactions \n\n* John \n\n* John sees the distortions in the market and that the most highly compensated work is becoming knowledge work.  Think about software engineers as top 1% earners. \n\n* John has already benefitted.  He's sold himself in the last few jobs as someone who can quickly learn difficult new skills and sees the deep work process as a way to accelerate this process. \n\n* John has not thought about the ability to concentrate as the key to learning difficult things.  His work performance went dramatically upward after getting diagnosed and taking medication for #ADD. \n\n* John probably needs to make deep work his top professional priority.  It doesn’t matter what part of the business he works in, but the deep work will help him become successful. \n\n* Nick \n\n* He's been wondering for a while now how the guests we've spoken to have been able to produce at elite levels.  These folks found a way to focus on the biggest bang for the buck. \n\n* Many of us want to raise our game and produce quality output faster, which seems to be the expectation as you climb the individual contributor ladder. \n\n* Nick sometimes doesn't set enough time aside for learning new things. Focusing more on this will help him adapt to our changing technology landscapes. \n\n* Nick wants to be less controlled by what is at the top of his Inbox.  Sometimes he works from the hot list instead of the things that needed progress the most. \n\n## 30:32 - Chapter 2 - Deep Work is Rare \n\n* Being at the edge of your cognitive abilities is not something business are setup to support.  They often times are in direct opposition to it.   \n\n* Think open offices and easy interruptions and unstated expectations to be very responsive. \n\n* The \"metric blackhole\" speaks to the idea that it is difficult to measure what is gained by doing deep work / what is lost by not doing it (organizationally speaking). \n\n* “The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.” \n\n* Finishing a task gives a dopamine hit.  Busyness does not mean productive. \n\n* Do highly visible administrative tasks take up our time? \n\n* “Knowledge work is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an activity that’s often at odds with busyness, not supported by it.” \n\n* Newport speaks to \"internet\" to mean highly connected behavior.  Businesses place a high value on connected behavior which can lead to shallow work.   \n\n* A craftsperson would spend time disconnected and focused.  Think about the blacksmith. \n\n* There's an advantage to cultivating the skill of deep work. \n\n* Reactions \n\n* John \n\n* It's difficult to read this and not immediately believe it.  John sees how distracted behavior keeps him from solving difficult problems. \n\n* John has direct personal experience with this.  Having the skills to learn quickly can get you selected for that next project or new job over others. \n\n* John is a recovering shallow worker.  It's very easy to respond to e-mails as they come in, respond to chats immediately, look at Twitter / LinkedIn constantly, etc.  This does not lead to feeling likrese you accomplished important things. \n\n* We're doing this because we want listeners to get exposed to the ideas. \n\n* The first thing to do is minimize the shallow and maximize the deep, becoming less connected during the day, concentrating social media into a time bound task with an agenda, etc. \n\n* Nick \n\n* Nick has felt busy all day before but wondered what he really accomplished at the end of it.  This would have been a day spent firefighting.  You must do firefighting, but maybe don't let it take all day. \n\n* We're looking to get to the next level, and we want to help our listeners get there too. \n\n* Nick plans to force the disconnected time to focus on the \"right stuff\" and can’t help but think back to [Episode 140](https://nerd-journey.com/take-time-to-be-present-with-eric-brooker-2-2) and [[Eric Brooker]]'s method of disconnecting to focus.  Nick wants to apply that same mantra to work items. [[Episode 140]]\n\n## 41:47 - Chapter 3 - Deep Work is Meaningful \n\n* Think about physical trades and high levels of craft.  This does not seem to exist with knowledge work, but why couldn't it be thought of like a craft? \n\n* Neurological argument for deep work being meaningful \n\n* \"…to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you’ll associate with your working life.” \n\n* The ability to focus and learn can help you focus but also suppress negative things. \n\n* Psychological argument for depth \n\n* Aligns with [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi)'s research that doing work was more enjoyable to people than relaxation.  It presented goals, feedback, and challenge (i.e. being in the [Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202) state). [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]] [[Flow]]\n\n* Philosophical argument for depth \n\n* Newport revisits the idea of craft here.  In physical trades you associate with high levels of skill, but the physical work isn't something required to hone your craft.  Knowledge workers can hone their craft as well (i.e. the high level of work brings the meaning and not the type of work). \n\n* Reactions \n\n* John \n\n* The section on suppressing / enhancing certain things rang true for John. \n\n* Just because an organization asks you to do something does not mean it is meaningful to them. \n\n* John says he thought initially that this section was less applicable, but as he does the meaningful work, he has enjoyed the positive feedback moreso than the philosophical dedication to craft.  Maybe that comes over time. \n\n* Maybe we can explore a link between not doing deep work and burnout. \n\n* John is torn about changing behavior.  He sees the meaning as a motivator after getting feedback through the process.  It all seems in retrospect and isn't necessarily motivating him to start doing deep work.  It didn't get him off the couch to start doing things as much as the pragmatic reasons for deep work (productivity, learning, etc.).  It might help him stay motivated to continue but didn't motivate him to start. \n\n* John wasn't sure what he'd change to align with the ideas in this chapter, but the more that he thinks about it, high levels of craft are desirable.  He thinks of the [[Apprentice, Journeyman, Master]] process.  There are some additional books John wants to read on this topic of craft. \n\n* [Shop Class as Soul Craft: An Inquiry into the Value of Work](https://www.amazon.com/Shop-Class-Soulcraft-Inquiry-Value/dp/0143117467)  [[Shop Class as Soul Craft]]\n\n* [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance/dp/B0000544SE/)  [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]\n\n* Nick \n\n* We know from [Three Signs of a Miserable Job](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Signs-Miserable-Job-Employees-ebook/dp/B000UZQHD4) by Patrick Lencioni if your work is not meaningful to the organization you work for (i.e. irrelevance), you will not enjoy your work.   [[Three Signs of a Miserable Job]] [[Patrick Lencioni]]\n\n* Keep in mind your work may not always be meaningful to the organization but could still be meaningful to you and vice versa.  Hopefully there is an intersection between the two. \n\n* There is something that makes you feel great about completing a task you weren't sure you could complete.  Overcoming obstacles can energize you. \n\n* Nick thinks back to [Episode 127](https://nerd-journey.com/countdown-to-burnout-with-tom-hollingsworth-3-3/) and [[Tom Hollingsworth]]'s discussion of burnout.  Tom mentioned the items on one's to-do list that grind away at you.  Perhaps we can move some of those forward through deep work. [[Episode 127]]\n\n* Nick experienced this meaningfulness more deeply while John was away earlier in the year, and regardless of the amount of work he never burned out (because of the meaning in the work).  \n\n* Check out [Nick's blog post](https://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2021/07/22/the-note-taker-and-the-editor-nerd-journey-turns-3/) on the experience of flying solo or listen to some lessons learned from his appearance on the [Full Stack Journey](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/full-stack-journey-058-new-challenges-and-embracing-change/) podcast. [[Full Stack Journey]]\n\n* What Nick found interesting was the rarified approach to your work in craftsmanship (independence in delivering something based on success parameters), and the act of creating is extremely meaningful.  \n\n* This goes back to [Episode 19](https://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/) and process over outcomes.  Newport is talking about enjoying the process so much that it creates meaning by doing the deep work. [[Episode 19]] [[Process over Outcomes]]\n\n* One of the books referenced is called [Rapt](https://www.amazon.com/Rapt-Attention-Focused-Winifred-Gallagher/dp/0143116908) by Winifred Gallagher about attention and losing focus [[Rapt]] [[Winifred Gallagher]]\n\n* Join us next week for part 2 discussing the practical tips for doing deep work! \n\n## [Contact

In today's episode we discuss part of the first rule of deep work, delving into tips for supporting the execution of deep work.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-02-2021 \n\nTopics – Book Discussion Format and Some Reminders, Deciding on Your Depth Philosophy, Creating a Ritual, Grand Gestures and Collaboration \n\n=========================== \n\n## 00:59 - Book Discussion Format and Some Reminders \n\n* This is part 2 of our review of [[Deep Work]] by [[Cal Newport]].  If you missed part 1 where we discussed what deep work is and its importance, check out [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why).  [[Episode 141]]\n\n* This book came to our attention in two ways: \n\n* [[Josh Duffney]] spoke about his use of deep work in [Episode 123](https://nerd-journey.com/focus-create-and-iterate-with-josh-duffney-2-2/).  [[Episode 123]]\n\n* We did a book goals episode earlier in the year that mentioned Deep Work as one of Nick's goals for the year - [Episode 108](https://nerd-journey.com/2021-book-goals-from-nick-and-john/).  He had read it some time close to the Josh Duffney episode but decided to read it again when John suggested we do a review of the book and its concepts. [[Episode 108]]\n\n* Here's a reminder of Cal Newport's definitions: \n\n\u003e Deep work - \"Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.\" \n\n\u003e Shallow work - \"Non-cognitively demanding tasks that are often done while distracted which are easy to replicate and do not create a lot of value in the world\" \n\n* An update on the format of this show \n\n* We originally thought we would cover all of part 2 of the book in this episode, but since there are many practical tips to discuss, there will be a few more episodes in addition to this one. \n\n* We'll summarize a part of the book and then answer the following questions: \n\n* Do I believe this? \n\n* Does this apply to me? \n\n* Does this make me want to change behavior? \n\n* What will I change as a result? \n\n* We're trying to model how we want to read books from this point on which are impactful to our careers and will likely do this from time to time. \n\n* Part 2 of the book starts with rule # 1 - work deeply. \n\n## 5:50 - Deciding on Your Depth Philosophy \n\n* Rule # 1 is work deeply, and that's extremely general. \n\n* Ideally we would all have workspaces that enable us to do deep work, but that isn't the case.  With so many distractions, it is quite the opposite. \n\n### Decide on Your Depth Philosophy \n\n* The monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling involves radically removing or minimizing the distractions that would take one away from deep work. \n\n* Examples in the book are of people who went to a dedicated space away from the rest of the world (which probably is not that realistic for us). \n\n* The practitioners of the bimodal philosophy of deep work scheduling divide their time between a period of monastic-like deeply focused work and a period of engagement without a priority on that focus. The time periods are generally up to the individual but don't divide below the length of a single day. \n\n* This might work for college professors, for example. \n\n* The practitioners of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling employ ritual to spend a certain time (or certain amount of time) of every day engaged in deep work. They try to remove the friction of engaging in deep work by deciding ahead of time that a time block is dedicated to deep work. \n\n* This is probably where most of us are going to fall (knowledge work type jobs).  We have to engage with the outside world for a lot of our day.  Maybe you schedule a couple of hours for deep work. \n\n* The journalistic philosophy of deep work scheduling is named after the journalists who practice it. They are oftentimes called on to shift into a deeply concentrated writing mode without warning. This is not an easy philosophy to engage in. It requires training to shift from shallow to deep very quickly. \n\n* People probably think they can easily do this (not the case). \n\n### 12:07 - Ritualize \n\n* There is a romanticized notion of how artists work, based around sudden sparks of inspiration. However, real artists work constantly and consistently. Build strict rituals to steer yourself into deep work. We do this to reduce the energy that it takes to transition to deep work and stay in that state longer. \n\n\u003e “\\[Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants.” - David Brooks \n\n\u003e “Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightening to strike you in the brain, you are not going to make an awful lot of work. All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself.” ― Chuck Close \n\n* Effective rituals should answer 3 questions: \n\n* When and for how long you should work \n\n* How you will work (rules and processes) \n\n* How you will support the work (removal of distractions, exercise, nourishment, etc.) \n\n* Reactions \n\n* John \n\n* The taxonomy made sense, and it's a nice mental model.  The rhythmic philosophy probably makes the most sense. \n\n* We can't be totally distracted the rest of the time, but leveraging the bimodal philosophy here and there can be helpful. \n\n* John says it was an easy yes to changing behavior.  Nick's suggestion to schedule time away from work might come in handy for non-work activities but not for primary job responsibilities. \n\n* John mentioned it makes sense to avoid distraction and doomscrolling during  \n\n* John plans to schedule time for deep work and keeping it a ritual instead of waiting for inspiration to strike.  Do the work, and edit later.  Being strict with the ritual of the time. \n\n* The Google Calendar app allows you to create goals and allocate time to it as well as a frequency.  The app will automatically find holes in your calendar and add time for the goals.  Having this automatically schedule an hour block in the morning and an hour block in the afternoon has been helpful.  If John schedules over this hour, the deep work gets rescheduled.   \n\n* John likes the idea of deciding what you will work on during a deep work session ahead of time, which reminds him of [Your Brain at Work](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Brain-Work-Revised-Updated-ebook/dp/B081FDPKZ1) by [[David Rock]] [[Your Brain at Work]] \n\n* Nick \n\n* Nick has experienced the bimodal part in the past by visiting an AirBnB and taking his podcast work with him (felt way more productive than he would have by staying home).  His wife went shopping, and he went into the zone working on podcast things.  Something about changing your normal environment flips a switch in some ways. \n\n* Nick liked the choose your own philosophy and agrees rhythmic is probably the best option, but he definitely wants to be able to flex into the journalistic mode from time to time when there's extra time given back to you (i.e. meeting ended early, etc.) \n\n* Nick needs to engage in the practice of deep work more often. The other day he put a list of items in the order they needed to be done during deep work time so there was no need to decide which to do first. \n\n* Ever since reading [The Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Shipping-Creative-Work/dp/0593328973) by [[Seth Godin]], Nick has wanted to write more often and feels deep work may be the way to get there.  [[The Practice]]\n\n* For a number of weeks Nick has ritualized writing a blog for his daughter's blog of fatherly advice.  This is now a habit. \n\n* Regarding the journalistic approach, Nick thinks back to [[Brianna Blacet]]'s experience as a journalist in [Episode 121](https://nerd-journey.com/the-writer-and-the-storyteller-with-brianna-blacet-1-2/)  [[Episode 121]]\n\n## 23:13 - Grand Gestures and Collaboration \n\n### Make Grand Gestures \n\n* The grand gesture involves making a significant financial or physical investment in an environment to make deep work possible, obligating ourselves to the task. \n\n* John and Nick agree that the occasional weekend away is probably more of a grand gesture than a ritual.  Sitting outside at a Starbucks, at a park, or even going to a library (if they are open and you feel comfortable there) to work for a bit would also go into this category. \n\n* John referenced Cal Newport's [Deep Questions Podcast](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/).  Cal decided to rent an office space away from home during the pandemic after losing his own home office because of home school for the kids. [[Deep Questions]]\n\n* We're not discounting the fact that this takes a significant monetary investment that not everyone has. \n\n### Don’t Work Alone \n\n* Collaboration can be a good tactic, but it should still involve structure to protect concentration and minimize distraction. (Bell Labs and MIT examples) \n\n* Newport is getting at the fact that businesses have learned the wrong lesson from having people interact with each other.  Bell Labs and MIT had areas where people could concentrate and then an area where people could congregate and eat meals together.  Collaboration often sprang up from there (i.e. the collisions of people), but concentration was also important. \n\n* Reactions \n\n* John \n\n* John feels he understands the concepts.  He found the Bell Labs and MIT examples extremely interesting (i.e. people collaborating with one another who normally would not).  The details of how the collaborations happened were interesting. \n\n* John mentioned the example of someone taking a non-stop flight to Tokyo and back to finish an entire book.  This person used the time to be unreachable and have no distractions.  The book also cited an interesting grand gesture about J.K. Rowling. \n\n* The grand gesture part made John feel like it did not apply to him.  He believes you can make a grand gesture and completely squander it.   \n\n* John is coming at this from the perspective of someone with Attention Deficit Disorder.  Many times he would rely on the fear motivator to help start working on something, which he feels is not the best motivator.  Organization and structure help him the most. \n\n* John agrees with Nick's take on the collaboration piece about the podcast but also cites the collaboration that he saw happen as a result of working in Google's office before the pandemic. \n\n* John is highly motivated to change behavior around organizing collaboration in a structured way and to bring other people's views into his work (getting feedback from others doing similar things). \n\n* Nick \n\n* Nick was a little more focused on the grand gestures section.  Committing to a big goal you're not sure you can achieve can often be quite the motivator. \n\n* Nick feels both concepts apply to him.  As far as collaboration goes, having a podcast co-host gives him time to think and say something in the moment a lot better than trying to monologue.  The collaboration itself that is structured into the show really helps the deep insights come out better than if one of us is doing it alone. \n\n* Nick has set some goals here and there but has not approached them from the deep work mindset.  He plans to now that he's re-read the book as part of this exercise. \n\n* Nick is taking away the importance of structure.  He thinks back to [[Josh Duffney]] in [Episode 122](https://nerd-journey.com/just-add-value-with-josh-duffney-1-2/) and deciding not to decide.  The correct episode reference is 122 even though Nick says 123 in the show.  There are things you say yes to which help you learn when to say no to other things. [[Episode 122]] [[Episode 123]]\n\n* Because Rule 1 has so many sub-points, we will continue Rule # 1 items in the next episode. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.02658882Z","tags":null},"/Episode-143":{"title":"Episode 143","content":"\n# Episode 143\n\nWelcome to episode 143 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 3 of a book discussion series, providing more on practical tips for the execution of deep work focused on the remainder of rule # 1 from Cal Newport's book.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-02-2021 \n\nTopics – 2nd Half of \"Rule #1 – Work Deeply\", Format Reminder, Execute Like a Business, Be Lazy, Shutdown Ritual \n\n=============================================================== \n\n## 0:58 Part 3 of our discussion on Deep Work by Cal Newport \n\n* Check out Part 1, [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/), where we discussed the “Why?” of the book, and Part 2, [Episode 142](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-2-the-structure), where we talked through the first half of the first rule. \n  [[Deep Work]] [[Cal Newport]] [[Episode 141]] [[Episode 142]]\n\n* Format: We’ll do some summarization, then answer whether we believe the point, whether it applies to us, whether it makes us want to change, and what we anticipate changing, if anything. \n\n* One thing we realized is that we want to model how we’re going to try to read books that have a big impact on us from now on \n\non by doing the following: \n\n* Summarize big points.  \n\n* Take notes.  \n\n* Record our reactions.  \n\n* Record what we’re going to try to change. \n\n ## Second Half of Rule #1 – Work Deeply \n\n### 3:14  Execute Like a Business \n\n* From The Four Disciplines of Execution (Franklin/Covey) \n\nIronic after discussing how businesses are missing deep work. This phrase refers more to the distinction between *what* to do and *how* to do it. \n\n#### Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important \n\nCreate a specific goal; Focus what you're working on down to the minimum things that will lead to professional success. Instead of trying to accomplish many things, try to accomplish a very few key things very, very well. \n\n#### Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures \n\nImportant goals involving deep work often have trailing metrics (measurements of the outcome) that come too late to make changes. Instead, make sure to measure lead metrics, the behaviors that should lead to the success measured by the trailing metrics. (Conflict with the idea of the metrics black hole?) \n\nFor knowledge workers, the leading metric is clear: time spent doing deep work in pursuit of the identified goal. \n\n  \n\n#### Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard \n\nMeasuring a behavior changes how you behave. Since the lead measure is hours spent in deep work in pursuit of the goal, the scoreboard should display that metric. \n\n  \n\n#### Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability \n\nHave a regular accountability meeting to review metrics and commit to specific adjustments in order to keep on track. A weekly review which lasts a few minutes can help to draw attention to sagging or rising work metrics and figure out what is causing the good or bad effect (in order to enhance or correct it). \n\n### 6:12 Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this? \n\n* John: Yes. I’m wondering if I’m biased towards things that are asking me to make difficult choices and measure data.  \n\n* Nick: Yes.  It’s extremely hard to pick the things on which you will focus.  You start to think to yourself, “What if I pick something and want to change it later?”  Maybe it’s fear of limiting options more than anything.  Saying yes to the thing that “Arises terrifying longing” was an intriguing way to put it.  This goes back to personal brand / what you will be known for in a way. \n\n* John: I want to focus on doing Deep Work as a primary ability and the specific part of the business is secondary, since that will change over time.  What I will be working on will change from year to year.  Any specific direction will change periodically because of our industry. I don't want to limit what I am known for or what my options are.  Picking deep work keeps you from limiting options.  \n\n#### Does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Yes, measurement seems difficult, but it isn’t really. Measuring time spent is simple, especially if you decide ahead of time and put it on your calendar.  \n\n* Nick: Yes.  I’ve done a less than stellar job of measurement to this point.  Sometimes we think about an estimate of how long something will take (long project), but maybe we don’t think enough about whether it took as long as we thought or longer and why. \n\n* John: This reminded me of intensity of focus, perhaps recording that level as well as the time spent. Recording lead measures has been something I haven't really done. \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior? \n\n* John: Definitely. Recognizing fear of something makes me want to face it. \n\n* Nick: Certainly. This reminded me of [Chasing Excellence](https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Excellence-Building-Fittest-Athletes/dp/1619617285) by [[Ben Bergeron]] and the 1% improvement across the board (aggregation of marginal games) for a cycling team. [[Chasing Excellence]]\n\n#### What will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: Yes, I ordered a [timeflip](https://timeflip.io/), as recommended by Don Jones (see [Episode 138](https://nerd-journey.com/apprentice-amplifier-and-people-developer-with-don-jones-2-2/) for how Don uses it). I am going to start recording a daily work diary recording hours spent in deep work. Use a timer, not my calendar, to keep me honest. I need to add in the end-of-week cadence, almost like a weekly shutdown cadence. Measure time in deep work and start making adjustments based on what I see.  #TimeFlip [[Don Jones]] [[Episode 138]]\n\n* Nick: I feel like I’ve been tracking the high level goals but not how long I have spent working toward them. What if I've spent zero time on a project?  Is it actually something I am focused on doing? \n\n* John: Cal Newport mentions in his podcast, [Deep Questions](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/), that sometimes procrastination is a subconscious way of the brain telling us it's not important or doesn't have concrete enough next steps.  I started listening to the podcast from the beginning and am making my way through the episode library. [[Deep Questions]]\n\n### 18:12 Be Lazy \n\n\"Laziness\" is really an emphasis on the division between work and relaxation. In order to fully commit to work, one needs to also fully commit to stopping work and relaxing.   \n\n  \n\n#### Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights \n\nWork that involves synthesizing lots of ambiguous and even conflicting information with many potential solutions is aided by the additional neuronal bandwidth which the unconscious mind has to bring to bear on a task. Thus, giving oneself a habit or ritual of ending the work day and allowing the unconscious mind time to go over one's work can be very helpful. \n\n#### Reason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply \n\nAttention Restoration Theory claims that spending time in nature can help improve one's ability to concentrate later. Psychologists studying it call concentration \"directed attention\" and say that it's a finite resource. If it's used up, it can lead to \"attention fatigue.\" This is similar to the idea of limited willpower to do deep work or inhibiting attention on distractions. Restoring attention heavily depends on not revisiting work at all (full attention on spending time in nature, for example). Knowledge workers can at least start this process by fully putting down work when they finish for the day. \n\n#### Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important \n\nIn “The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance,” [[Anders Ericsson]] writes that novices can't perform \"cognitively demanding work\" for more than an hour a day, while experts can only rarely do more than four. Recognizing this leads us to protect the time that we do spend on deep work but also that just adding hours to the end of the day is rarely productive. \n\n  \n\n### 21:44 Shutdown Ritual \n\nEnsure you have a plan to act on every incomplete project that you have, in a place you’ll find it. This removes the cognitive overhead of wondering if you’re forgetting anything. \n\nSaying the shutdown phrase, “Shutdown complete” was an interesting tactic. This might seem silly, but is a minor point compared to actually recording your state on all your projects. It's probably a way of using the auditory part of your brain to also understand that the work day is over.  \n\n  \n\n### 24:06 Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this? \n\n* John: Yes, ever since I read [Getting Things Done, by David Allen](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-David-Allen-audiobook/dp/B01B6WSK5C).  Don't keep all the tasks in your head because you will forget. See also [David Rock's reference](https://www.amazon.com/YOUR-BRAIN-WORK-REVISED-UPDATED/dp/0063076063) to only being able to remember 7 things.  There is cognitive overhead in trying to remember things.  Being able to walk away seems to important. \n\n* Nick: I know I’ve reached the point of diminishing returns where I thought “I could work on this longer, but it’s doing me no good and isn’t my best work.  I need some kind of break.”  Doing deep work toward the end of your day is possible, but you have to assess whether you have the energy. \n\n* John: This reminds me of Pat Gelsinger's idea of putting everything away to get home, realizing he might need to work between 9 PM and bedtime, and reserving time exclusively for relaxation and family. \n\n#### Does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Yes. I'm trying to work on things but am still striving for improvement. I also like Attention Restoration Theory and going into nature. \n\n* Nick: Yes.  I struggle to put things down at the end of the day pretty often.  What I have been doing to help is keeping a log of the things that should be worked on the next day / ideas for solutions to problems.  Sometimes these aha moments come in the evening after I’ve stopped working for a little while.   \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior? \n\n#### What will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: Yes. Have a way to deal with ideas that pop into our heads from the unconscious mind. That was the whole goal. Capture for future work periods. Make sure I’m actually walking away from work and recording my state in every project in order to truly put it down. I’ll start scheduling a block at the end of each day to do that. Keep a place to record random thoughts to follow up on if something comes to mind outside of working hours.   \n\n* Nick: This frees you up to be present with your family. It’s one thing to free the mind / get the work out so you can rest, but I think I could do a better job organizing those things in general once I’ve let them go for the day.  I like the idea of turning work off and not allowing yourself to dig back into it if you’ve shut down.  Even not checking e-mail from the time I get up until I start work could help. \n\n* John: It's fair to take a moment to record thoughts that we have during relaxation time so that we don't spend any energy trying to remember it. How about checking work e-mail? I turned off alert (all push notifications). I haven't done it with chats on my phone. I need to investigate how to make chat notifications only show up during work hours. And that's different from suppressing the urge to check work emails and chats. \n\n### Summary thoughts on Rule #1: Work Deeply \n\n* John: Practical? Yes. Thought provoking. Actionable. \n\n* Nick: There are many things here to consider and will take some practice to master. Take the example of checking email at the start of the work day, not first thing in the morning. Checking might make me try to remember the reactions I have to that email instead of being fully present. I need to remember to try to make small, incremental changes, not big ones.  There's a boundary setting discipline here too. \n\n* John: Great point. Even 2 hours a day of calendared deep work has been tough to be 100% on. This underlined the idea that you have to train your brain to be in that state and only allow thinking about a single thing. \n\n* Nick: This is like a hard core diet for your mental game. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you've read Deep Work and have reactions you think we missed, we'd like to hear from you.

In today's episode we share part 4 of our book review on Deep Work by Cal Newport.  We'll talk through the book's advice on embracing boredom, how it contributes to deep work, and share our reactions on practicality. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-14-2021 \n\nTopics – \"Rule #2 – Embrace Boredom\", Format Reminder, Taking Breaks from Focus, Work Like Teddy Roosevelt, Meditate Productively \n\n=========================== \n\n## 00:57 - Part 4 of Our Discussion on Deep Work by Cal Newport \n\n* Check out Part 1, [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/), where we discussed the “Why?” of the book (why deep work). Parts 2, [Episode 142](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-2-the-structure) 3, [Episode 143](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-3-the-execution) were focused on the first rule of deep work, which was working deeply (the structure and the execution). [[Deep Work]] [[Cal Newport]] [[Episode 141]] [[Episode 142]] [[Episode 143]]\n\n* Format: We’ll do some summarization, then answer whether we believe the point, whether it applies to us, whether it makes us want to change, and what we anticipate changing, if anything. \n\n* One thing we realized is that we want to model how we’re going to try to read books that have a big impact on us from now on \n\non by doing the following: \n\n* Summarize big points.  \n\n* Take notes.  \n\n* Record our reactions.  \n\n* Record what we’re going to try to change. \n\n## 5:03 Rule #2 - Embrace Boredom \n\nThe ability to perform cognitively demanding tasks with intense concentration is something that needs to be trained over time. It’s a skill, not a habit. People think they can lead highly distracted lives, then turn on concentration when they need it. Studies show that they’re wrong.  \n\n### Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus. \n\nIf you train your brain to be distracted and need the dopamine of changing tasks or seeking out digital distraction, you won’t be able to perform high level deep work. Don’t schedule deep work, assume everything is deep and schedule small times for shallow work. \n\n#### Point #1: This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies. \n\nSchedule time for those tasks more frequently. Just keep to the discipline of scheduling. \n\n#### Point #2: Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.  Resist the temptation to get connected during deep work. It’s too easy to get distracted while looking something up. If you’re blocked, then switch to a different offline activity.   \n\n#### Point #3: Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training. \n\nYou can’t just leave work and abandon your good behaviors, any more than a professional athlete can train all day then return home and ignore the diet they need to support their top performance. You can’t let your brain get wired for distraction during your time off. \n\n### 8:48 Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this? \n\n* John: Yes. It makes sense that the brain circuits we train the most are the ones that we fall back on using. The idea that we’re training ourselves to need that jolt of dopamine that comes from indulging in social/news/doom scrolling is probably more destructive than I realized. \n\n* Nick: This is one is really interesting to me.  I think we’re afraid of being bored in some ways like [[Tom Hollingsworth]] mentioned in [Episode 127](https://nerd-journey.com/countdown-to-burnout-with-tom-hollingsworth-3-3/) (always feel we should be “doing something”).  We have this need to fill the downtime.  I completely buy into the need to train and get ourselves disciplined into new habits that don’t encourage seeking distraction.  I think getting into a habit trains the skill of intense focus.  [[Episode 127]]\n\n* John: I think on the [Deep Questions](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/) podcast Newport mentioned that at no other time in our history have we had devices in our hands that were built by social scientists to distract and endlessly grab our attention for monetization.  When I was younger and had not yet been diagnosed with [[ADD]], I always carried a paperback book around to distract me.  I would read that whenever I wanted a distraction.  Television is similar today with the ability to binge watch shows.  I also remember playing solitaire on my mobile phone as a distraction while I was waiting for something.  I would do that everywhere.  Every time I would finish a game I would get that dopamine hit.  I don't have the app on my phone any longer.  Now that I think about it, there are other behaviors like reading news feeds while waiting for a meeting to start.  These are all specifically avoiding boredom.  I am at times late for things so I won't get there early and get bored.  So many things for me are driven by this avoidance of boredom. [[Deep Questions]]\n\n#### Does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Yes. I've already been talking about it. \n\n* Nick: I think it does.  I think it applies more to checking e-mail followed by checking Twitter and LinkedIn.  I might get up from my desk to get something to drink and end up checking LinkedIn / Twitter.  I don’t find myself lingering there.  I just feel this compulsive need to check it.  I'm not present in the few minutes I take to be present doing something that isn't work - complete irony.  \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior? \n\n* John: Yes. \n\n* Nick: Yes. \n\n#### What will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\nJohn: I need to resist the news app. Maybe uninstall it or block it? That’s the thing I use on my phone the most to distract myself. And I’m not sure what the point of it is. In retrospect it’s to head off boredom and to distract myself from the deep work I actually need to accomplish. It's very easy to jump through recommended videos for hours on YouTube. I need to work on tightly scheduling social media or YouTube with specific goals.  I think I've turned off the majority of my e-mail notifications and don't want to use it as my task list.  I feel I have successfully moved away from e-mail as my task organization system. \n\n* Nick: I might need to logout of Twitter and LikedIn on my phone like I did with Facebook.  Then there’s no way to check it when I take a break.  But also maybe I should leave my phone at my desk when I take a break.  I’m not so important that I can’t be away from my phone for 5 minutes.   I need to work on the scheduling part across the board.  I have done better about closing e-mail down to focus, but there's a subconscious grinding away that is happening when I do it.  Maybe that goes away? \n\n* John: John found he was depending on e-mail notifications to remind him to do things.  The e-mails he had been sent that were not archived or deleted sitting in the Inbox were the reminders. Moving the task organization system to somewhere else (not your Inbox but to a Task).  For John it was that feeling he was forgetting something.  Now he creates a deadline on the calendar to ensure nothing is forgotten. \n\n* Nick: It's more this need to be responsive than anything and a fear of not being responsive enough. \n\n* John: The way to reach me if you need me to be responsive faster is a text and then escalate to a call, so I wouldn't leave my phone somewhere.  I would never expect someone to respond in 2 minutes to an e-mail.  Calling, leaving a voicemail, or war dialing would be more of an emergency.  If I was in a meeting and saw someone had called me a few times in a row I would step away in answer, thinking it's an emergency.  Maybe I should publish that because probably not everyone knows it. \n\n### 23:48 - Work Like Teddy Roosevelt \n\nThis is about short periods of *intense* concentration with no breaks and no distractions. But one should probably emphasize the intense concentration and not the short periods. \n\n### Meditate Productively \n\nMeditate on a professional problem while you’re engaged in a mostly mindless physical task (going for a walk, for example). Continue the intense focus. \n\n#### Suggestion #1: Be Wary of Distractions and Looping \n\nIf something else pops into your mind, redirect the mind back to the problem on which you're focusing and the next step in the problem solving process. \n\n#### Suggestion #2: Structure Your Deep Thinking \n\nReview the variables of the problem, define the next step question you need to answer, and think about that. At the end of your time, consolidate your gains by making sure you know the answer you came to or the progress you made. (Unsaid - record this). \n\n### Memorize a Deck of Cards \n\nEngaging in other cognitively demanding activities can help you in your deep work process. It acts as additional training.  There was also a story from the book about a man who converted to orthodox Judaism who was engaged in a serious study of the Torah, which was extremely cognitively demanding.  This boosted his professional abilities as well.  See also [Moonwalking with Einstein](https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530) by [[Joshua Foer]]. [[Moonwalking With Einstein]] \n\n### 27:34 Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this? \n\n* John: Parts of it. I’m suspicious of the “Work Like Teddy Roosevelt” section because it feels like the Journalistic Philosophy of switching on intense work. Or the total blockout of all distractions seems like it’s not something one could just start out doing.  Applying pressure on yourself and ramp up of anxiety to get yourself to work may for me allow more procrastination. I like the Meditation idea in conjunction with physical activity (maybe even taking a walk through nature and not being in front of a computer).  I also like the idea of picking up some other cognitively demanding hobby which also trains your concentration. That would be almost any skilled hobby, actually.  Swing dancing used to be a serious hobby of mine.  Learning the moves was extremely cognitively demanding. \n\n* Listen to the cognitive boost a co-worker of John's got from learning swing dancing. \n\n* Nick: I like the idea of giving yourself a short amount of time and putting some pressure on.  I think I’ll have to see if the stress level going up a little in this experiment increases or decreases my ability to concentrate deeply.  I like the structuring your deep thinking. I feel like the structuring deep thinking is the deep work session equivalent of the shutdown routine you’re supposed to implement at the end of each day. \n\n* John: This reminded me of a point made in [Your Brain at Work](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Brain-Work-Revised-Updated-ebook/dp/B081FDPKZ1) by [[David Rock]].  The author talks about how your brain needs a balance of stress and reward hormones.  Finding that balance of engagement and excitement (but not too much of either) seems to be the way to go.  [[Your Brain at Work]]\n\n#### Does this apply to me? / Does it make me want to change behavior? \n\n* John: Yes. I don’t think I do enough of the meditation. If at all. I don’t have a cognitively demanding hobby right now. I have not been swing dancing for some time.  Maybe my approach to reading this book and others is a start. \n\n* Nick: I like to take walks most days of the week, and I find that I’ll either listen to an audiobook or just let my mind wander.  Sometimes it will center / focus on a situation / problem on its own, but sometimes it’s a continuous stream of things that bounce around without any focus.  I don't know that I have tried to focus / hold my brain on a specific thing.   We know that exercise can stimulate the brain.   \n\n#### What will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: I need to start adding meditative walks.  There are some green spaces around where I live, and being able to schedule some deep work time away from the computer makes a lot of sense.  As for adding a cognitively demanding hobby, I think it's worth doing.  Maybe I can pursue my reading in a more structured manner (i.e. a certain amount per night). \n\n* Nick: I feel like my subconscious is already grinding away on problems whether I want it to or not.  I’ve been doing some meditation using [Calm](https://www.calm.com/gp/9b2skt) (follow the link for a 30-day guest pass) to quiet the mind and relieve anxiety.  They have some great instrumental music to help you focus while you work. When you do a meditation with the app you are encouraged to focus on your breathing and to try to stay present, which I believe is the same focus you're after when trying to solve a problem.  Sometimes I will listen to one of these while I walk.  Part of this is being present so you can focus.  Meditation teaches you to learn to be present, to focus on the now.  They even tell you to redirect your thoughts if they get sidetracked.  I plan to keep doing it. \n\n* John: I like that idea.  I think I have a similar app with some be present meditations.  My team recently did one, and I found it really helpful and energizing.  It cleared my mind from a lot of clutter.  I was surprised that this actually worked, but it definitely did for me. \n\n* Nick: People could do this as part of a work shutdown routine or even before bedtime to keep your mind from racing.  It takes practice to master, and you won't always be able to keep it from happening.  But it is the practice that is important. \n\n* John: This goes back to that idea of recognizing you are distracted and trying to get back to being present.  The app I use is [headspace](https://www.headspace.com/). \n\n* Nick: If your workplace has a health and wellness benefit, ask about it before you pay for it yourself! \n\n* John: If you don't have the benefit, ask your boss if you can expense the app. \n\n### 40:07 - Summary thoughts on Rule #2: Embrace Boredom \n\n* John: The idea that we need to restructure our lives around avoiding distraction is compelling.  I liked the on point advice.   Maybe because it’s asking a lot to exercise the resistance against distraction, which seems to be the key to making something seem worthwhile. It's quite reasonable to not check e-mail or something else when you have a couple of spare minutes, but it feels unreasonable at first. \n\n* Nick: The introduction of structure at this level sounds incredibly overwhelming.  Don Jones mentioned in [Episode 138](https://nerd-journey.com/apprentice-amplifier-and-people-developer-with-don-jones-2-2/) that he blocks a specific amount of time to answer online forum questions.  I think when I was more active in the [Spiceworks Community](https://community.spiceworks.com/), that was my doomscroll addiction whenever I had a minute and even when I was trying to find answers.  I never put limits on that time.  I imagine the meta level structure is one of those things that takes a lot of work on the front end to get gains on the back end in efficiency.  For example, not checking e-mail except during scheduled times is tough to do. [[Episode 138]] #Spiceworks [[Don Jones]]\n\n* I feel like this period of deep work is exactly what [[Tom Limoncelli]] encouraged us to protect in [Time Management for Systems Administrators](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Management-System-Administrators-Working/dp/0596007833).  That time spent on finishing your most important priority is the deep work.  It took reading Newport's book to make that connection.  I couldn't do it well then. Maybe I can do better now. [[time Management for System Administrators]] \n\n* John: You need different coaches to say things in a different way until it lands.  And then you get the benefit of all that coaching all at once.  Some of the advice from Getting Things Done, Your Brain at Work, and a number of others landed as a result of reading Deep Work.   \n\n* In Newport's [Deep Questions Podcast](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/), he encourages us to NOT time block family time.  I can understand time blocking for online forums.  But don't time block weekends or family time. [[Deep Questions]]\n\n* Getting off the e-mail addiction felt like removing any other distraction (Facebook, Google News, forums).  I feel like I have gone through that process.  It involved going through a bunch of e-mail filtering to bubble up important messages.  Think about what to delete, archive, and file.  I automated a lot of this because I took advice of someone who had a talk on this when I joined Google (i.e. auto-filter for mailing lists). \n\n* Nick: I'm still in the detox process when it comes to e-mail. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you've read Deep Work and have reactions you think we missed.

In today's episode we share part 5 of our discussion on Deep Work by Cal Newport.  We'll focus on the 3rd rule of deep work, which is quitting social media.  Does it mean what it sounds like it means?  Listen to find out! \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-24-2021 \n\nTopics – \"Rule #3 - Quit Social Media\", Format Reminder, The Any Benefit and Craftsman Approaches to Tool Selection, Law of the Vital Few, Quitting Social Media, Using the Internet for Entertainment \n\n=========================== \n\n## 00:57- Part 5 of our discussion on Deep Work by Cal Newport.  \n\n* Check out Part 1, [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/), where we discussed the “Why?” of the book (why deep work). Parts 2, [Episode 142](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-2-the-structure) 3, [Episode 143](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-3-the-execution) were focused on the first rule of deep work, which was working deeply (the structure and the execution). Part 4, [Epsiode 144](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-4-embracing-boredom/) is focused on the second rule of deep work, embracing boredom. \n  [[Episode 141]] [[Episode 142]] [[Episode 143]] [[Episode 144]] [[Deep Work]] [[Cal Newport]]\n\n* Format: We’ll do some summarization about why we’re talking about deep work, then summarize what we read in Rule #3, answer some questions along the way:  \n\n* Do we believe the point? \n\n* Does it apply to each of us? \n\n* Does it make us want to change? \n\n* What we anticipate changing, if anything. \n\n* One thing we realized is that we want to model how we’re going to try to read books that have a big impact on us from now on.  \n\n* Summarize big points.  \n\n* Take notes.  \n\n* Record our reactions.  \n\n* Record what we’re going to try to change. \n\n## 2:37 - Why Are We Reading Deep Work? \n\n### The Deep Work Hypothesis \n\n\n\u003e Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.\n\n\n\u003e Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding tasks that are often done while distracted which are easy to replicate and do not create a lot of value in the world \n\n\u003e The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. \n\nWe found this compelling and wanted to bring the information to our listeners. \n\n## 3:56 - Rule #3 Quit Social Media \n\n### The author shares points from author [[Baratunde Thurston]]’s 25 days disconnected from the Internet. \n\n#### These tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate \n\nThere isn’t really a debate about this, and it especially impacts those who are trying to generate value through focus and concentration. \n\n#### Knowledge workers feel powerless in their discussions of network tools and attention \n\nThe idea of the Internet sabbatical or sabbath gained traction in some circles. The tools aren’t evil, but we need a different approach to deciding which ones to use and to what degree. At the same time, we need to reject “distracted hyper-connectedness” as a necessary state in our work. \n\n### The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection \n\n\u003eYou’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it. \n\nPeople are using tools without weighing the observable negatives against the potential positives. \n\n### [[The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection]] \n\n\u003e Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts. \n\n\nThis approach doesn’t ignore the potential positive impacts. Tools aren’t good or bad; they’re just tools. What we have to do is examine all aspects, positive and negative, of using the tools when we decide whether they go in our toolbox or not. \n\nThese strategies help to transition from the “any-benefit” approach to the “craftsman” approach. \n\n### 6:49 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this? \n\n* John: Yes.  I see the point.  There's an interesting contrast between the any benefit approach and the craftsman approach. Is the tool positive enough to keep on using it?  I think most of the time we unconsciously make a choice.  Newport is saying we should use the craftsman approach to all tools we use.  The point of deep work is to get away from distraction.  Social media is designed to capture and monetize it. My experience of Facebook was being annoyed by the alerts on my phone. I’d get alerts for a post from a friend I wasn’t mentioned in. I finally just uninstalled the app from my phone because the alerts were that distracting. I strongly believe in getting rid of social media that does not have a positive impact.  \n\n* Nick: Yes.  I attended AmpNavigator back in early October (mentioned in the Don Jones episodes - [137](https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/) and [138](https://nerd-journey.com/apprentice-amplifier-and-people-developer-with-don-jones-2-2/)), and at least 3 of the sessions (if not more) spoke to a reduction or at least controlling of social media.  Two of them were specifically centered on deep work.  There's something to this.  One presenter even spoke about how he trimmed friends / connections on social media and the methodology behind accepting connection requests. \n\n#### Does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Kind of. I’m mostly off of Facebook. I use LinkedIn mostly professionally, and I am very task-focused in my use of it.  The DM is the alert I'd respond to the quickest. I don’t think there are many other networks I’m on. There’s some communities I’d like to use more, to be honest, like [Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/).  I got so much from that community, and I have not found an effective way for me to engage with it without getting lost in it. I’m wondering whether there’s a positive benefit to “giving back to the community” which I can take into account. Maybe we could [ask Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/). \n\n* Nick: The thinking about it like a craftsman (analyzing benefits and negatives) is not really something I have done.  Maybe the benefits are to the greater community (i.e. more than just to me) and need to be considered.  I think many others probably are in the same boat.  To the average person, doing so much analysis on the front end about the why / benefits of a specific tool is probably a turn off (i.e. you’re making me think too hard).  But I definitely see the logic behind it. \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior, and if so, what will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: I think it confirms my existing behavior. To be honest, I’m generally extra critical when I read something that confirms my beliefs. And I do see the downside of it (not engaging with social media). I’ve drifted away from people I could stay in touch with more easily on Facebook. I’ve missed their life events. But I could I maintain those connections in other ways.  I definitely understand the point, and if anything it's made me want to gain the benefits which could be had from a tool like Facebook. \n\n* Nick: I mentioned in [one of our previous episodes](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-4-embracing-boredom/) the need to just check LinkedIn and Twitter.  I realize that isn’t constructive, but I do feel using Twitter and LinkedIn are of benefit to help me keep up with professional trends and find new potential show guests.  I’d say it does make me want to do a bit more analysis to make my use of any new tools more constructive.  And this goes back to embracing boredom, letting my breaks be breaks, even if just a few minutes. \n\n* John: It's funny that I didn't even think of Twitter. As one of the tools I use.  Maybe it's because I do not engage with it that much.   \n\n* Nick: I get trends and news of the tech industry from Twitter / LinkedIn (lots of things to stumble upon). \n\n* John: It's a low friction way to have discussions in these areas.  Writing blog articles is high friction (maintain a blog, keep up the content, help people find it, etc.).  Twitter and LinkedIn are more of a broadcast. \n\n* Nick: When working for large company like we do, I have found so many helpful blogs and other content on Twitter that I would not have found otherwise. \n\n* John: Those tidbits can't be broadcast on Twitter and LinkedIn only.  Perhaps we need more analysis (the following points). \n\n### 18:29 - Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits \n\nWhether or how to use a specific tool is dependent on the context of the person making the decision and the type of work they do.  There's no single answer to whether a tool is net positive or negative (depends on the person). \n\n#### Identify your main high-level goals \n\nGoals shouldn’t be too specific. You should probably have both professional and personal goals. \n\n##### List for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal. \n\nActivities should be specific. \n\n##### Consider the network tools you currently use and ask whether the use of the tool has a substantially positive impact, a substantially negative impact, or little impact \n\n#### The Law of the Vital Few \n\n``` \n\nIn many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.” \n\n``` \n\nWe should spend our time and attention on the few things that get us 80% of the benefit rather than taking on the negatives of the things that can, at best, bring us the last 20%. In most situations, turning out the best work possible represents the 80%. Connectivity probably falls in the last 20%. \n\n### 20:55 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this? \n\n* John: This is a restatement of the Pareto principle - 80% of the outcomes are from 20% of the causes.  This is the first challenging task. I don’t want to list my goals and activities that support them.  You're asking me to be explicit when reading a book, and I would rather think in the abstract.  This is hard work.  But it’s a worthwhile task.  I found it to be a difficult ask, and ask a result, I believe it.  I'm way more likely to believe something if it's challenging than if it is easy. Probably the 80% of the benefit is doing the really good work. \n\n* Nick: This is analogous to finding a best fit regression based on data points. I like the idea of aligning use of tools with goals.  It’s making the list of personal and professional goals that doesn’t sound so fun.  I believe it, but I don't want to. \n\n* John: I'm totally on board with that.  It is challenging.  I wonder what it is about this that is challenging.  Is it the accountability aspect?  \n\n* Nick: It's too much work.  It's too much structure.  \n\n* John: It's extra work that is cognitively demanding. \n\n#### Does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Yes, clearly it does. I have to resist the idea that I’m already not using these tools and actually go through the process.  I don't want to, and it feels like a lot of work.  The idea that I have not done this is troubling. \n\n* Nick: I think it does, but it requires far more thoughtfulness than perhaps I had considered in the past. I just don't want to do it and don't really care about the why. \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior, and if so, what will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: Yes.  I need to challenge myself to actually set out goals and activities which support them.  How hard can it be?  I could probably hammer it out verbally in 5 minutes. That’s a good thing to do regardless of the context of assessing network tools.  Once you have the goals it should be pretty easy to come up with the tasks that support them. And I need to keep it in a place that I can review and refine it regularly.  Maybe it's the implication of all that work. I can already see that I’d probably add text chains to stay in touch with people I care about.  Maybe it's the idea of taking on the work without experiencing the emotional payoff that I know is positive. \n\n* Nick: Yes and no.  I see the reasoning here in looking at the benefits / impact.  I do think trying to look at how this could help more than just me is a smart tactic.  When I think of modeling this kind of thing for my daughter, I get more motivated to actually do it than otherwise. \n\n* John: That reminds me about the giving back to the community that has brought us benefit. \n\n### 29:51 - Quit Social Media \n\nSystematically sort through the networking and connectivity tools (or behaviors) you use and see what the effect of quitting them for 30 days is without announcing it. Then ask: \n\nWould your life have been significantly better using it? \n\nDid anyone care that you weren’t using it? \n\nIf you answered “no” to both questions, quit that activity/service/behavior permanently.  \n\nSocial media is especially insidious at its ability to generate fear of missing out. It also allows the illusion of an audience, even though that audience is shallow. Writing medium to long form blog posts and building an audience through quality of output is difficult and sticky. Short form tweets are easy, shallow, and ephemeral. \n\n### 31:04 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this? \n\n* John: This, I’ve already done. The term “significantly” is a rough one to assess.  Being off Facebook, I know I have missed major life events of friends.  When I moved from Southern California to Northern California Facebook would have been the way to keep in touch.  I don't think I was using it that much at the time.  I would like to have the benefit of staying in touch, but I don't know that taking on the distraction of Facebook is the way to get that benefit back.  There are other avenues to get this benefit. \n\n* Nick: I definitely do.  And the FOMO comment reminds me of [Episode 127](https://nerd-journey.com/countdown-to-burnout-with-tom-hollingsworth-3-3/) with Tom Hollingsworth and how it can eventually lead to burnout.  It's funny how we keep getting back to burnout. \n\n* John: Constant engagement and distraction is one of the major ingredients to burnout.  Feelings of insignificance is another.   \n\n#### Does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Yes. I can definitely see how going through this process for what we think of as vital communities would be helpful to breaking an addictive cycle to them.  I went from hours per day to ours per year in Spiceworks, for example.  I can see it in my behavior around joining other online communities.  Often times I join a community around a specific topic, discuss the topic, and then don't logon again. I don’t think of them as deep connections and treat them that way. \n\n* Nick: Yes.  I’m very rarely on Facebook but didn’t quit it completely.  I logged out of it on my phone and can only login via my personal computer.  I was spending too much time just scrolling through it each day.  I have done a better job of not constantly checking Twitter / LinkedIn on weekends at least.  I can leave my phone in the other room and don't have to be listening for a phone call.  I still feel I could do better during the week.  I like the idea of not making the assumption that everyone will miss me if I take a break for 30 days from social media.  The idea is to see if that is actually true, and maybe that will give you an idea of whether a specific platform does or should have an impact on your life. \n\n* John:  If there is some kind of professional organization that you moderate, etc. that only meets on Facebook of LinkedIn, it is a tool you can't really drop for 30 days.  The question becomes more about having it on your mobile phone and if that is needed to handle the task or do the job.  Is it something you can just use on a computer in a regimented way (i.e. 15 minutes per day)?  The thing you said about alerts rang true.  I have been systematically been turning off which apps are allowed to alert me.  If I get direct message or get mentioned, maybe I do want to be notified about it.  But if there is only a general conversation, do I need an alert on that? \n\n* Nick: Alert fatigue isn't just for IT operations. \n\n* John: The problem is platform-run algorithms are choosing the proper alerts to try and keep me engaged with the platform.  My rules are simple.  I want to know when I am mentioned, when someone is sending me a direct message, or when someone is wrong on the internet.  That last one is the one I am trying to avoid. \n\n* John: The rules are simple.  I want to be alerted only when Nerd Journey or I am mentioned.  I want to go in and check out feeds of other career oriented discussions / podcasts / previous guests / others I follow manually.  The idea that I could just look on my feed and trip across what I want is not true.  The feed isn't being curated by me. \n\nNo, this feels more like confirmation. If I need to go find the things, then I need to invest time to go and find those things and not leave it up to social media algorithms to find it for me. \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior, and if so, what will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: This feels like confirmation of what I am already doing.  I've quit the things I needed to quit, but if anything I need to filter alerts a little better. \n\n* Nick: I think I’m already doing a little bit of this by decreasing the time spent on each platform.  I will say the fear of missing out gets a little less with less use.  I still need to reign in the need to check LinkedIn and Twitter constantly. \n\n### 42:10 - Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself \n\nUsing sites that monetize your attention for entertainment is dangerous. They provide an appealing alternative to boredom and are engineered to keep your attention. Using them is damaging to our ability to concentrate without distraction. \n\nInstead, provide some structure to your time off with hobbies, reading, or spending quality time with friends and family. Give yourself something meaningful to do for all of your waking hours. \n\nDon't think you can read this and get all the information the book covers on this point!  We only have so much time to speak to it on the air.  Go back and read it for yourself. \n\n### 43:42 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this? \n\n* John: Yes. I can definitely see this as an extension of the “embrace boredom” strategy.  If you use the internet to entertain yourself, you are indulging in distracted behavior, quick hits of dopamine, and doing a shallow task that feels like you're accomplishing something. \n\n* Nick: Yes.  The sites not only monetize your attention but rather can set you up to make purchases you don’t need. \n\n* John: Now we're back to the any benefit strategy. \n\n#### Does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Yes. I think I said before that YouTube is my big downfall, especially since it’s an app on my television (Roku).  I'm really going to find it challenging to apply this. \n\n* Nick: I don’t find myself spending too much time on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, or any other platform.  If you ask my wife, she will tell you I am mesmerized by television.  It doesn't matter what is on.  If she's watching a show I will stand there for a minute and just stare at it until she asks if I am going to sit down and watch or leave the room.  I don't know why I am mesmerized by it, but because I am, I watch very little of it.  There are so many things I could watch on Disney+ alone. \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior, and if so, what will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: Yes, but part of me doesn't want to change. Since I read this, I’ve started to think critically on how I use YouTube. Maybe I’ll program some things to watch from my desktop, and limit my time to that, without indulging in the recommendation engine while I’m watching?  I have turned off autoplay (a long time ago), which is annoying.  That being said, scrolling through recommendations is something I want to cut down and approach in a more programmatic way. \n\n* Nick: Meh.  I don’t pursue entertainment that much and rarely watch TV these days (i.e. limit tv because it mesmerizes me).  If I keep myself busy with hobbies and other things to do, it's easier not to fall into the trap of whatever your doomscroll habit is.   \n\nBut I will say I could get lost in training and enablement if someone let me.  \n\n### 49:25 - Overall Reactions? \n\n* John: This seemed simple until I thought about the entertainment point and remembered the idea of embracing boredom. Overall, I definitely see the upside in refraining from social media and the internet as an entertainment tool. It’s too addictive and distracting. \n\n* Nick: The analysis seems like a lot, and I think it is.  Again, I think it gets easier once you start doing it.  People will read this advice and feel like it’s too much work.  I see all of this as a better way to help you see what is and set boundaries to help you change it if things have run off the rails.  I don't think we should kill off all internet use, but I do think applying some controls to the way we use it and how much time is spent using it is smart and healthy.  When we talk about social media, think about how you are accessing it and how much time you're spending. \n\n* John: Maybe you only need to do the analysis if you need to have a strong argument to keep one of these tools?  If you're ok with letting them go, why do the work?  I suppose you could make an argument that you need to do the analysis for other things. \n\n* Nick: It would be super interesting to have a group of middle and high school students do this type of analysis (what tools are in use and how much time is spent) and compare it their parents' analysis or perhaps people in the tech industry…and to see if the sample population considers any negatives of these platforms.  I didn't consider the negatives of the platforms in the past.  Around the time I stopped teaching high school math (2007), Facebook was really gaining popularity. \n\n* John: I imagine distraction in the classroom is a problem regardless of what we're talking about.  Unless you're thinking about the context of distraction being a destructive force in your life, you likely wouldn't see any downsides. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you've read Deep Work and have reactions you think we missed, we'd like to hear from you.

In today's episode we share part 6 of our review of Deep Work by Cal Newport, discussing the 4th rule of working deeply - drain the shallows.  We'll discuss recommendations for scheduling your day and guidelines for how to quantify the depth of every activity. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 11-07-2021 \n\nTopics – \"Rule # 4\" - #DrainTheShallows, Schedule Every Minute of Your Day, Quantify Depth of Every Activity \n[[Deep Work]] [[Cal Newport]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 1:06 - Part 6 of our discussion on Deep Work by Cal Newport.  \n\n* Check out Part 1, [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/), where we discussed the “Why?” of the book (why deep work).

These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.\n\n\n\u003e Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding tasks that are often done while distracted which are easy to replicate and do not create a lot of value in the world \n\n\u003e The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. \n\nWe found this compelling and wanted to bring the information to our listeners. \n\n## 4:09 - Rule #4 Drain the Shallows \n\nThe shallow work we’re asked to do isn’t as important as it seems. Eliminating as much shallow work as possible can drive success and excellence. There’s a limit to the shallow work we can eliminate while still maintaining our positions and there’s a maximum amount of deep work we can do a day. However, bias yourself towards the deep over the shallow and question whether new shallow work is actually useful or whether it compromises your deep work. \n\n### 5:11 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this and does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Yes, this is the key step if you’ve been brought along on the series of ideas that Cal Newport has laid out. Minimize the low value work and maximize the high value work. I definitely have shallow work that I have to eliminate in my job.  I have examined everything and tried to change the way I do work, evaluating whether something is deep or shallow as it comes in. \n\n* Nick: I believe it in principle, and I feel like I have interacted with people who have been able to do this already.  I don’t think I’ve eliminated as much shallow work as I could. In trying to bias toward the deep, I find myself often getting pulled into the shallow and not accomplishing the deep.  Maybe part of it is in having trouble saying no to helping others.  But I’m also still learning. \n\n* John: People ask us for our time every day, and their emergencies become ours.  It's difficult to ignore these requests, especially if it's coming from management, for example. \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior, and if so, what will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: There are several things that immediately pop into my mind. Minimizing my interaction with chat and email I something I think I have done as I read the book. Minimizing or chunking my administrative tasks into blocks instead of spreading them throughout my day is another. As you were talking, I thought about maintaining my status and project state in a ready-to-publish way so if I ever get asked for fire-drill type information, it’s as easy as a copy-paste.  Much of the information I am being asked for falls under the category of something I need to have ready before I am asked because it's really part of being well organized.  I'm not perfect at it but probably need to schedule more time to ensure I am recording everything in a central place, allowing me to easily read someone into a project. \n\n* Nick: That's a great point about centralizing the task list and making it publishable. I don’t find myself questioning the shallow tasks enough, not in a “problem with authority” kind of way or narcissistic way but more along the lines of not using the craftsman approach (kind of like we talked about with tool selection).  I see this in a similar light.  It means I need to be more thoughtful in what I say yes to and what saying yes means as well as how it impacts my “protected time” for deep work.  For me, it’s affirmation I need to do better with setting boundaries.  \n\n* John: It's good self-analysis.  The book and its points have been good for spurring this type of analysis. \n\n### 10:51 - Schedule Every Minute of Your Day (Nick) \n\nTime block planning: Decide what you’re going to do at the beginning of the day, how much time it will take, and when you’ll do it. Every minute of your day should be covered. You can always re-work the schedule. Take into account that you’ll probably underestimate the amount of time it takes to complete tasks, and use “overflow blocks” of time. Schedule more task blocks than you think you need, and for longer periods so you have areas to flex into for unexpected work.  \n\n### 11:25 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this and does this apply to me? \n\n* John: I do believe this, it applies to me, and it is still not easy to apply.  I read this several weeks ago, looked at my calendar, and saw that every minute is definitely not scheduled. I automatically push-back so that I can have the ability to flex into the things that might come up.  That be a little silly.  If nothing comes up and nothing is scheduled, what does that mean I do with the time block?  I would then need to make a decision about what is most important and do it on the fly instead of centralizing the task and prioritizing at the beginning of the day and spreading across time blocks, expecting that it can change.  I have this idea in my head that I need to have free time for people to schedule meetings with me, and it's difficult to let go of that.  We have all these automatic tools now.  If I schedule every minute of every day, my next free block cannot be until tomorrow.  There are ways to get around this. \n\n* Nick: I like what you said about taking the need to decide out of the equation by listing it as a priority at the beginning of the day, even if it changes over the course of the day.  This one is tough...so tough in my mind it makes me not want to do it.  I tend to shy away from too much structure like this.  I can certainly appreciate the “overflow block” idea presented, which provides structure for chaos in a way (which is what our days tend to be).  You could skim a part of this book and come away with the idea that you need to be an inflexible jerk, but that's not what the author is suggesting.  I'm walking the fence between too helpful and too selfish, trying not to be too much of either. \n\n* John: I totally get that.  When you get asked to do something there's this process we have to go through on where this aligns to me, my account team, my territory team, region, and company.  By saying yes to one thing I am saying no to something else (i.e. giving precedence of one to the other).  Your manager can easily make that decision for you, but you don't want to get tagged as someone who needs guidance all the time. \n\n* Nick: If you're in a shorthanded department, for example, getting the manager to prioritize something for you doesn't make you look like you lack prioritization skills in my mind.  To your point, you don't want to be seen as always needing advice on what you should work on next. \n\n* John: Sometimes it's more like I have 6 hours of work to complete in the next 4 hours, which is physically impossible.  Right now I may be too close to understand the order in which I should do these and need management's oversight.  If management is not providing guidance but assigning more work than can be done, that's a problem. \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior, and if so, what will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: Yes. There must be a happy medium here between fully booked and having some open blocks.  I could easily fill in my daily empty slots with tasks that I need to accomplish. That is, pre-schedule every task to a specific time (based on the task's deadline). This would be pretty easy to do with current tools, and I can maintain my availability easily as well.  Scheduling a block of time and marking myself as free allows others to see when I am available.  I can give myself some general structure, but if someone needs me, there are things they can schedule over.  My reservation is I can't appear to be unavailable for an entire day. \n\n* Nick: If someone has to ask every time they want to schedule a meeting with you, that is more interruptions. \n\n* John: I want them to be able to use tools to look at my calendar and just send an invite, making it easy for important interactions.  But I also want the structure to be able to say here's what I want to get accomplished and loosely schedule it, knowing I will do some juggling. \n\n* Nick: I really don't want to schedule every minute of my day.  I think it goes back to the same issue you mentioned of wanting to be available for other people.  I like your compromise idea.  This one kind of makes me want to change, but I'm going to leave it there. \n\n* John: Maybe I will commit to trying to do this for the next 30 days and see how it goes.  If it's a total failure very early on, it is easy to stop.  If it's successful but too much work, I can then stop. \n\n* Nick: I think what I just heard you do was commit to writing a blog post about this trial period.  Is that right? \n\n* John: One of my goals for reading and applying deep work was to generate more content, including blog posts.  If you're hearing this is the far future and can't find where I've written about it, contact me and ask where it was published. \n\n* Nick:  \n\n### 22:58 - Quantify the Depth of Every Activity \n\n\u003eHow long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task? \n\nThat is a way to assess how deep a task is.  Then bias your activities towards deep activities.  In other task philosophies, it is the opposite (get rid of the simple, quick task to get it off your plate without needing to record it).  If something will only take 5 minutes, how important is it for you to do it at all?  This starts to result in some hard questions up the chain.  Listen to John's example of this based on a specific situation. \n\n### 25:56 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this and does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Yes, I find myself adding this filter in mentally for every task. Right now, I’m categorizing this as a “weeks” or “months” issue and not tracking it.  It should be a simple task to formalize it. As soon as I say it’s simple, I realize it isn’t. A gut instinct on assigning a depth number should be a good enough first pass.  I would probably need to fight against needing to get it too precise.  Newport suggests tracking the number of months as the time measurement. The only time to closely examine things is when they’re on the border between deep and shallow. It’s also not really a prioritization number because there's a difference between how deep something is and its priority. It’s a way to decide what to keep and what to try to shed. \n\n* Nick: I like quantifying the depth of your tasks to give an idea of the amount of deep work you’re accomplishing (i.e. the idea of tracking what reality is).  It doesn’t mean I’m doing it all the time, but we should see what reality is and then what to do about it. \n\n* John: Even the binary classification of deep or shallow is better than not doing it at all.  And recording it is better than not recording it. \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior, and if so, what will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: I’d like to try to do this for a month to see how it affects my workflow.  Maybe I'll start off with deep or shallow only. I should assign a “deepness” number when recording the task (like 1 month or less, 6-12 months, and 1 year or more to get a feel for shallow / intermediate / very deep). I don’t have a way to add metadata to tasks, but I can just informally add a line at the top of each task at the time of its creation (or in the title). I'd still like to try it for 30 days, and then re-assessing should give me a good read on how it’s working or not working.  I have to be careful assigning myself too many of these to report back on.   \n\n* Nick: I know John will somehow get me back for encouraging him to do these 30 day test runs and report back. \n\n* John: It would be interesting to see how many people are reading along, made it to this point, and what they think about it.  If you have a strong reaction to quantifying the depth of each task, [Tweet at us](https://twitter.com/nerdjourney), and let us know whether this makes sense to you.  We'd love your feedback on  \n\n* Nick: After hearing your reaction, my feedback is closer to the getting things done approach in some ways (especially for the 5 minute task that needs to be classified, etc.).  Maybe it would be worth it if it was something recurring.  I did experiment with this a little in the last few weeks on a notepad (classifying the depth of each activity as deep / shallow - only 2 options).  It helped me batch together shallow items more efficiently than I would have otherwise.  Is it easy to continue to do this?  Absolutely not.  It’s one thing to start doing it but another to keep at it.  The latter is where I need more effort.  At some point I fell off the horse and started working off the hot list again. \n\n* John:  That's interesting.  Where do find these tasks coming from (e-mail, text, chat, outcome of a meeting, etc.)? \n\n* Nick: I would say it's a mixture of all of those.  Usually it's I said I would do something, and I want to make sure I do what I committed to do.  Sometimes it's a really good idea I had that needs capturing but that isn't as urgent as something else.  I have not been classifying the source of the tasks, actually.  If I have to spend too much time with a classification system I don't know that I will stick to doing it, even if the payoff is worth it.  I'm not sure if I'm being lazy or if I have this misconception about it being too much work out of the gate.  I have a feeling there will be listeners who take the same stance. \n\n* John: In my experience, when you're asking yourself to do work up front to save you work in the long run, that is difficult in general for humans.  Who early on in their career is fanatical about putting money away for retirement?  It may be the right time to do it, but it's hard to think over that time frame.  In order to do it, you need to make all of these things part of your process.  I'm not saying that is easy to do.  I feel your pain.  I haven't done it. \n\n* Nick:  If I am being lazy here I fully admit it.  It's a bit of a struggle to get over the hump. \n\n* John: That instinct to just do short tasks is something we need to resist during deep work blocks.  It is a distraction, and we should record it to do later.  Fully recording what to do can be when we classify whether it's a deep or shallow task.   \n\n* This time John gives Nick homework.   \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you've read Deep Work and have reactions you think we missed; we'd like to hear from you.

However, bias yourself towards the deep over the shallow. \n\n### 5:19 - Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget \n\nDescribe the concept of Deep Work to your boss and ask what percentage of your time should be spent doing deep vs. shallow. This can drive down the expectation to be extremely connected.  \n\nThe budget might also change your behavior, for example, biasing you against status update meetings in favor of being accountable for deadlines.  \n\nIt will also alert you if you and your boss have wildly differing ideas about how much of your time should be spent on shallow work. You might need a new position if this can’t be resolved. \n\n### 6:27 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this and does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Yes, but I don’t think it applies to me.  This is a step you can take if your manager / co-workers think you are not connected enough or responsive enough based on company culture.  Present this idea if there is some kind of conflict.  At least so far, no one’s said I’m not responsive enough.  Almost never is there an e-mail that needs my attention in the next 15 minutes, and if there is, people usually try to get in touch with me using multiple channels (chat, text, phone call).  I cannot afford to interrupt my work every time there's a chat update.  That doesn't make any sense.  I turn off alerts and set reminders so that I respond to chats and emails 3 times a day.  If it's your job to monitor a chat channel and respond within a specific amount of time, that's your job, which means no one can expect you to do things that require deep concentration at the same time. \n\n* Nick: Maybe a little, but the boss has set expectations for turnaround times on things like e-mail, etc. and encouraged our team to do the same (i.e. 24 hour response, text / call if it’s more pressing).  I don't know that I've done a great job at setting these expectations with my co-workers, but that's a different story.  I think you can find out the answer to how connected you are expected to be when you get to know a new manager just like [[Brad Pinkston]] advised in [Episode 84](https://nerd-journey.com/management-interviews-and-transitions-with-brad-pinkston/).  You're not always going to be in a position where you need to ask for a shallow work budget.  Maybe if you don't feel like the work you are doing is valuable, go through the exercise of depth classification and presenting that back to the boss.  If you're doing too much shallow work and you don't want to be, I think it could lead to extreme dissatisfaction. [[Episode 84]]\n\n* John: It's about that adaptation, flexing, discovering, and compromising.  If you're being asked to do something that requires to do deep work to do well and there's a lot of shallow work in conflict with that, you need to have this discussion. \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior, and if so, what will I change to align myself with this idea? \n\n* John: I don’t want to change anything right now, but I do feel well armed to have a conversation with my management or teammates / colleagues if it ever becomes an issue.  \n\n* Nick: I agree with you, John.  It doesn't make me want to change at this point.  I see it as a button you can press if and when you need to. \n\n* John: It's good to have a tool in the toolbox that's just in case.  You never know when your work situation will change, your manager or team changes, etc.  I like the tool, and I like the tip. \n\n### 14:19 - Finish Your Work by Five Thirty \n\nCal Newport calls this fixed-schedule productivity: Set the end time, and work backward to schedule things so they can end there. This includes carefully guarding the shallow work budget.  \n\n### 14:50 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this and does this apply to me? \n\n* John: Yes, and I’ve been getting better about this step, but still need to focus on it.  What I'm taking from this idea is not necessarily the 5:30 time because that's not always possible.  For IT professionals, you might be on call.  Maybe you're traveling or taking colleagues / customers to dinner.  What I do see here is a general guidance to end your day at a specific time and then work backward from there to make sure you can actually walk away at that time (i.e. no loose ends, record all action items somewhere to quickly find them). \n\n* Nick: When I read this, my first reaction is it can’t be done or is unrealistic (to do consistently).  I like your point that it might not necessarily be 5:30 for you.  Likely many of us I have needed to do this when we were about to go to a medical appointment during the day, leave town for a trip, etc.  I think it definitely applies.  It's time boxing on a larger scale.  I think you stated it very well (much better than I did).   The spirit of the advice is that you need to have a cut off time. \n\n* John: If you're doing knowledge work, you have an infinite amount of work that you could be doing.  You're not going to get to the end.  You have to put a boundary on it.  Sometimes you have outcome limits like a deadline (something must be completed today), and those are the times in which you might end up violating what your ideal day is going to look like / how it will end.  Stuff happens, and you will have to juggle your schedule.  That is life.  But if you have the goal and you start working backward from it, you know what you need to do to get there and what needs to be juggled to react to things that come up.  \n\n* Nick:  My immediate reaction was \"I can't do it.\"  But I also haven't tried it.  Maybe I should and see how it goes. \n\n* John: For me, I did exactly that.  That meant I had to put a meeting on my calendar at 5:15 that reminded me to organize my task management system.  During that time I need to take the things in my head and start shutting down.  I actually found this takes more like 30 minutes.  If you don't leave the time to organize your thoughts at the end of the day you will not be able to easily pick it up when you next start working.  Schedule the shutdown time, and that effects the last meeting, administrative time block, or deep work time block.  I'm definitely not perfect at it and am up to maybe 30% of the time doing it (which is up from zero). \n\n* Nick: For me it's a missing metric altogether.  I don't know if it makes me want to change right now.  Maybe I should start. \n\n* John: Do you not have a desire to stop at 5:30?  That's a tougher question than I thought. \n\n* Nick: I don't know if there's a fear of setting the goal because I'm a afraid I won't be able to hit it.  I had not heard the perspective you gave until we recorded this show and liked your idea of picking a time.  It could depend on the day and what the family schedule is like. \n\n* John: If I need to pick the kids up at school today, then I need to be finished 45 minutes before I leave for example. \n\n* Nick: I think it's fear of not being able to hit the goal.  I have some workaholic tendencies and am trying not to check e-mail constantly.  I definitely would like to stop being addicted to e-mail, but it's challenging. \n\n* John: It's that fear that you've been notified and you're not responding (i.e. someone is waiting on you). \n\n* Nick: In some ways we create our own situations, and this is one I created myself. \n\n### 23:35 - Become Hard to Reach \n\nWe can’t quit email, but we don’t need to give it control over all of our attention. \n\n#### Tip #1: Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work \n\nWhen publishing a “general inquiries” email, tell people what you expect of them to best evaluate their note. \n\nAlso, set the expectation that you might not respond immediately or at all.  \n\n#### Tip #2: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails \n\n\u003e What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion? \n\n“Process-centric approach” to email, spelling out the process to get from the current state to desired state with the minimum number of additional email interactions. \n\nReduces the emails in your inbox and the brainpower you use to process them. \n\nIt entirely moves the task from your inbox/memory into your task management system ([[David Allen]]: “closing the loop”). [[Getting Things Done]]\n\nPut more work into crafting your email responses to lay out the future process and thus minimize the chance you end up playing email ping-pong, requiring you to spend time and energy monitoring your inbox as a project management tool. \n\n#### Tip #3: Don’t Respond \n\n\u003e Professorial E-mail Sorting: Do not reply to an e-mail message if any of the following applies: \n\tIt’s ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate a reasonable response.\n\tIt’s not a question or proposal that interests you. \n\tNothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad would happen if you didn’t. \n\tExceptions should be obvious based on role-power or relationship. \n\tLet the small bad things that might happen, happen. Reclaim the good big things that happen when you don’t manage your projects via email responses. \n\n### 28:53 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this and does this apply to me? \n\n* John: This definitely applies to me.  I’ve definitely seen people in my workplace ask others to do some work before scheduling a meeting on a specific topic, so I think the culture allows that.  One of my coworkers published a win story about a customer along with two different recorded talks about it, encouraging people to send a meeting invite for questions not addressed in those talks.  I don’t know that I’m getting enough requests via email to make this an issue for me. Even podcast emails don’t rise to that level.  I definitely get messages as a result of the podcast, but the volume does not overwhelm me to the point that I am losing time responding.  People usually have fairly specific asks, and I'm happy to spend the time with them.  I publish a way for people to schedule time with me.  If I started to get 5 messages a day asking for help with resume writing, for example, then maybe I would create a document of resources and share that with people first before offering time to meet with them 1-1. \n\n* John: As for the second tip, I totally believe that. Email ping-pong, the instinct to prepare a minimally responsive email that puts the responsibility on someone else, is something that I fight every day.  We have access to a tool called group availability, for example, that allows me to look up available times for me and other colleagues and provide it to someone wanting to have a discussion. \n\n* Nick: I like the idea of setting expectations for e-mail responses.  I can say I’ve not really done that well with others.  They only know what they’ve observed.  We can't all create a generic contact mailbox because we're not all college professors.  This is really about scaling yourself and so the attention to responding does not take away from the work you need to do.  I’m skeptical of the “make others do more work” approach.  I like the concept, but I’m skeptical of whether people really read e-mail thoroughly enough for it to be effective.  It makes me think back to [Episode 137](https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/) and [[Don Jones]]' 4-page e-mail response.  I totally understand not responding if you’re on CC and a response is not required. [[Episode 137]]\n\n* Nick: As for just plain not responding, I see what Newport is saying, but I’m also not a popular author who is getting a ton of fan mail (i.e. the general inquiries e-mail approach).  I also don't want people to think I'm a jerk if I don't respond to an inquiry. \n\n* John: That makes sense to me.  It's about managing e-mail when there is a conflict.  If there's no conflict, you don't need to use these tools.  I think that 2nd tip about laying out a process is helpful.  You can cut out a lot of the things that could turn into 10 e-mails. \n\n* Nick: You remove the ambiguity by giving the person on the other side a clear way to make a decision. \n\n* John: And if they don't agree with the steps, they can say so.  You can preface the whole thing with \"here's what I propose,\" and that gives them permission to disagree with the process. \n\n* Nick: This also helps break the focus on the quick response to just get something back to the sender. \n\n* John: How quickly you respond is interesting compared to the quality of your response when you do respond.  A fast response can often be virtually useless and could make it ambiguous on who should take the next action. \n\n* Listen to Nick and John riff back and forth with some examples based on this comment. \n\n* [ ] John: The second tip seems the most useful.  I certainly get ambiguous things and am CC'd on things for visibility (no response required).  There are few things I've done where I need people to do more work first.  If there's something like that I have already published a thing to read.  I have had a number of folks reach out to me about joining Google from VMware. Since this has been the thing that has happened the most often for those thinking about joining Google / just joining Google (i.e. wanting more information from me), I probably should write something up. \n\n* Nick: That's more homework for you, John, very much like last week.  If you're out there and you're tracking John's homework assignment Tweet at us #johnwhitemetrics or #vjourneymanmetrics. \n\n## 42:54 - Conclusion \n\nDeep work is a pragmatic choice to focus on the ability to concentrate without distraction and get valuable work done. It’s not about taking a moral stance or making a philosophical statement. \n\nPursuing deep work is difficult and most likely requires large changes in behavior and perhaps some sacrifices (particularly of attention-monetizing technology). \n\nIt may be difficult or even scary to produce the best work you’re able to and have to face that it doesn’t yet meet the standards you want it to. (Ira Glass, creator and host of “This American Life”: Early on, your taste outstrips your ability.) \n\n\u003eBut if you’re willing to sidestep these comforts and fears, and instead struggle to deploy your mind to its fullest capacity to create things that matter, then you’ll discover, as others have before you, that depth generates a life rich with productivity and meaning. \n\n\n### 44:25 - Reactions \n\n#### Do I believe this and does this apply to me (conclusion and book as a whole)? \n\n* John: Yes. I love the idea that this is about pragmatic choices and not moral or philosophical stances.  I do want to produce at a higher level than I am now, and I recognize the level of production I've been able to maintain has not met the standard that I want.  For example, I don't feel the level of writing that I put out is not the level of writing I enjoy reading.  When we started podcasting, it probably was not the level of podcasting that we wanted, but we kept at it.  Hopefully we've improved over time. \n\n* John: The book as a whole takes the task management ideas that I read about in [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-David-Allen-audiobook/dp/B01B6WSK5C), focused on productivity, and adds in the dimensions of depth-of-meaning and long-term value. This book has helped me figure out my foundational philosophy of the type of work I want to do and which of the tasks in front of me align with that philosophy.  We're back on philosophy.   \n\n* Nick: I believe it and feel it applies for me.  The key word in all of this is struggle.  It really is a struggle to change your behavior, regardless of what it is.  This book is about breaking undesirable habits that you didn't know were undesirable until you read it or some like it.  I think back to [Switch](https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Dan-Heath-Chip-Heath-audiobook/dp/B0038NLX9S/) by [[Chip and Dan Heath]] and the steps:  [[Switch]]\n\n* Direct the rider \n\n* Motivate the elephant \n\n* Shape the path \n\n* Nick: I think Newport does a good job providing ways to support the change.  The first time I read this I thought the ideas were very inflexible and that the amount of structure is completely overwhelming.  Like I said before, it seems like the amount of structure recommended is too much.  I do not think everyone is willing to do the work it takes to enable deep work and the continuous efforts to keep doing it.  It's going to be a challenge for me. \n\n* John: My reaction to the structure is total agreement. Upon further review, Newport is coming from a position in which he has the ability to do this (as a professor).  He can control his schedule to that degree.  It's our job to take the lesson and apply the underlying meaning instead of the surface meaning.  It might seem inflexible, but can you look past the hard and fast rule as stated and look at the underlying meaning.  Take the structure and learn from it. \n\n#### Does it make me want to change behavior, and if so, what will I change to align myself with this idea (conclusion and book as a whole)? \n\n* John: It makes me want to change, and I’ve already started changing. I’ve re-organized my [[Career Goals]] around doing deep work. I’ve started to quantify how I’m spending my time with a timeflip. I’ve started to push back on the amount of shallow work I’m doing, or at least how I’m doing it (i.e. batching, time blocking). This has been a revolutionary read for me.   I am going to keep on iterating and know I have not committed to getting every part of this implemented. I was to switch over to this system, but the way to get there is incrementally. \n\n* Nick: I know the payoff is worth it.  I know to advance in my field I need to be doing my best work.  Creating an environment / atmosphere that enables me to do that kind of work aligns with things like promotions, pay raises, and aligns with my personal values.  I don't think I have done as much work as you in fundamentally changing my behavior.  I don't think I have done enough but would like to change the amount of changes.  I want to be more consistent and change small things at a time.  This book is about breaking / changing bad habits and is also about self-care.  Not everyone will think of it that way, but the boundaries are helpful. I think of the advice in the book in a similar light to [The Power of When](https://www.amazon.com/The-Power-of-When-audiobook/dp/B01KGEGR7E) by [[Michael Breus]] in that even small changes will help you improve.  To your point about iterating, I think small changes are the key.  For me it's things like turning off push notifications for e-mail (which I have done).  Does it mean I still check it too much?  Maybe.  I think if you try to change everything suggested in the book at the same time, you will fail.  You'll fall off the horse.  You need to pick something (like a small win) and measure to see if it's working / you've mastered it.  Part of this process is tracking, checking in on yourself.  If you don't do that, you'll fall back into old habits, and for me I think that's the problem (trying to do too many at once and need to get success from just one or two).  Treat it like the [[Dave Ramsey]] debt snowball. [[The Power of When]]\n\n* John: One action has a virtuous cycle which frees up attention and resources to work on the next thing, etc.  I like that idea. \n\n* Nick: Maybe the first thing you start with is being ok with boredom and focusing on a problem you need to solve.  Maybe that makes a huge difference for you.  But you have to practice it. \n\n* John: I've found what you're talking about to be a very compelling way to do this.  Also the logical part of your brain and motivating the elephant are what the first part of this book are about.  Decide if you agree with it, first.  I'm interested in what other people have done in listening to this series.  Did it motivate you to read or listen to the book? \n\n* Nick: DM us on Twitter if you want a free copy of the book on Audible. \n\n* John: Let us know what your reaction has been to the content. \n\n* Nick: Are there other sources containing similar advice that we haven't read?  We'd be interested to explore them. \n\n* John: I'd be very interested in reading conflicting advice if anyone wants to recommend some. \n\n* Nick: That is the [[The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection]] at work.    [[Deep Work]] \n\n* Even though this series has reached its conclusion, there are more interviews with new guests coming your way soon! \n\n* Maybe from time to time we should share where we are on the deep work journey? \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you've read Deep Work and have reactions you think we missed; we'd like to hear from you.

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Chris Wahl and discuss Chris's early experience demonstrating proof of work, advanced certifications, and experience at a startup.  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 9-23-2021 \n\nTopics – #ProofOfWork, #Blogging, Encouraged to Move On, Over the Mountain of #VCDX, Into #OpenSource, #Startup Magic and Being a #Builder #Slalom\n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:22 - Proof of Work \n\n* [Chris Wahl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wahlchris/) is a Senior #Principal at [Slalom](https://www.slalom.com/).  He leads a team of consulting technologists who solve complex problems related to public cloud, #DevOps and many other items under the technology umbrella. \n\n* Technology was never a mystery for Chris.  His dad had a computer when he was a kid, and Chris wanted to take it apart and play with video games.   \n\n* Chris found odd jobs working at the library writing code and even led a computer user group in college (think LAN parties). \n\n* After graduating from Devry, he put together a binder with all of his work (building / fixing computers) to impress interviewers.  After sharing the binder with someone from General Motors, they hired him. \n\n* Always think about what someone else might not be doing that you can showcase.  Maybe it's certifications or something else. \n\n* Chris didn't want an easy first place.  He wanted to crush it (and he did). \n\n* The binder had some design work and the planning he had done as part of the computer users group. \n\n* There is nothing wrong with having a body of work to show your experience and capabilities. \n\n* John mentions publicizing the types of projects you work on is a great way to share proof of work. \n\n## 7:13 - Blogging \n\n* Chris started blogging in about 2008.  In 2008 he was working in an IT role (Sysadmin / Help Desk) and new he needed to elevate himself.  He was reading other people's articles. \n\n* After realizing he was solving a lot of problems, why not write about it? \n\n* Chris wanted to contribute back to the communities that had helped him but also wanted a way to remember some of the unique things he had done (which he wasn't otherwise going to be able to remember as well). \n\n* Was blogging an extension of the binder? \n\n* Writing is the best skill you can hone as a technologist.  It is often cited as the largest gap.  The only way to get better at it is to write at it. \n\n* If you leverage writing for a second brain, a time machine, or a place to showcase your work you are developing the skill of writing well (which can catapult you into new heights in your career) and getting many other benefits as a result. \n\n* If you're afraid someone will be critical of your work, it's optional to receive the feedback.  You can turn that stuff off. \n\n* If you are creating it for the reasons Chris mentioned, you can leverage some trusted peers for feedback.  The anonymous internet is not nice, so you should not expect it to be. \n\n* John has heard the term second brain before. \n\n* Chris's approach to what he hears / learns is to write it down.  He uses [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) with color coding and a labeling system. \n\n* He needs a clean working palette to be creative.  If there is a technical crust, it doesn't work.  He needs a searchable repository. \n\n* The bits that erupt into a blog are usually more finite in nature and less part of the metadata kept in his \"second brain.\" \n\n* John has recently started reading about personal knowledge management, specifically [Zettlekasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). * The system Chris described seemed to be a continuation of the binder.   [[Zettelkasten]]\n\n* There is an iterative process to writing.  What you start with is never what you finish with.  There are some layers of self-exploration involved. \n\n* Writing makes you think about how you're going to display the information.  You're not just coming up with it in real time but creating a flow with a start, middle, and end.  Many times you walk into the middle of a problem, so writing things down in a structured way gives you another perspective on the solution. \n\n* John says you're writing for a future version of you without the contexts you have right now. \n\n* Chris likes non-opinionated systems for knowledge management (a blank slate that allows you to define the flow) without a lot of structure required.  Chris wants to be able to get in and start taking notes. \n\n* This is part of the reason he chose Google Keep.  The tags and labels made sense because this is how Chris would manage his cloud accounts / infrastructure. \n\n* Take a well defined process that works for technical documentation, automating that to work in the cloud world, and applying to a knowledge repository.  There will be a number of great patterns that work. \n\n* Any time Chris has a conversation and wants to pick out something important (idea, solution, concern).  If he's taking longer bits of notes, it will probably go into a Confluence page or something that is meant more for a project. \n\n* \"Pretty much everything goes in there.  I won't know if it's valuable or not until later.\" - Chris Wahl \n\n## 16:20 - Encouraged to Move On \n\n* The job at the dealership was Chris's first real technology job and involved taking care of 3 dealers.  His predecessor had left him a screwdriver, a car magazine, and the domain admin password (and spelled the domain wrong). \n\n* Everything was kind of greenfield, allowing Chris to design the IT stack for each location.  For several years it was building PCs, working with technicians, and getting to understand the business (financial systems, business process flows, and how to integrate them into the IT stack). \n\n* Chris still has good relationships with his former colleagues (including is former boss) today. \n\n* His investment was to learn the business and figure out how the tech could make it better. \n\n* Chris loved it there and was told by his boss he needed to find something new (was capped out on raises). \n\n* There is a lot of experience that goes into building something from the ground up. \n\n* Looking back, this forced Chris to be scrappy, come up with solutions, and be a part of the greater community. \n\n* Chris's manager at this employer was not the norm.  Not every manager would encourage an employee to leave the company to better themselves. \n\n* Chris feels he lucked out on this one. \n\n* They had an honest relationship.  Chris expressed that he wanted more challenge and to work on more interesting things. \n\n* Chris and his manager struck a deal where Chris hired his replacement and stayed 2-3 months to train the new hire and find a job.  At first Chris would show how the systems worked and then allow the person to drive and ask Chris for help when needed. \n\n* The open relationship between employee and manager is something Chris has tried to apply for the people who work for him now.   \n\n* If we can't help you here, let's find you something great elsewhere. \n\n* It's hard to explain an entire enterprise in 2 weeks. \n\n* Chris encourages us all to leave it better than we found it, and he feels he did that at the dealership, leaving good documentation and honing his writing skills in the process. \n\n## 22:24 - Over the Mountain of VCDX \n\n* Chris worked a college education company, a medical company, and didn't really know you could work for a vendor.  You worked for companies and did tech stuff. \n\n* In 2011 he went into consulting, realizing there was no job where he would not get bored / restless or automate himself out of a job.  Consulting seemed to solve this. \n\n* Chris has never worked in a sales role by choice.  He respects people that do, but it is not for him. \n\n* Chris was the wrench turner, installing things like Horizon View, VXBlocks, etc. for customers. \n\n* He felt the designs he was being given to go implement could be better.   \n\n* For the first time Chris thought maybe he could be the one solving the problem and building the architecture instead of the one installing the things. \n\n* This put him on a journey to go get the [VMware VCDX](https://vcdx.vmware.com/) and prove he cold do it, starting to do some architecture and progressing to the point where architecture was all he was doing. \n\n* Architecture was the type of work Chris began to like more at that time. \n\n* After you are in the datacenter for the 30th day in a row, the fantasy wears off.   \n\n* The certification is great, but it depends on who you are talking to and how they value it. \n\n* It was an elation to get certified, but Chris had reached one of the highest levels you can achieve with the VCDX.   \n\n* Chris realized that was not the end and that he did not want to do architecture forever. \n\n* There are two paths to go down.  You can let the high level certification be what you are, or it can just be something you've done.  Too many people let it consume their identity.  Chris even leaned that way at first but realized it was just an achievement. \n\n* Chris wants a little fear to direct him. There was no fear, so he knew it was time for something different (which for Chris was cloud architecture and getting back into code). \n\n## 27:47 - Into Open Source \n\n* Chris started in the OpenStack days helping with Nova and Cinder but was mostly helping with documentation. \n\n* He eventually got into the PowerShell scene and really liked solving problems using the language. \n\n* Chris wrote an open source project called [Vester](https://github.com/WahlNetwork/Vester) for VMware configuration management.  It was a unit testing engine that checked config values.   \n\n* Someone reached out to him after he stopped actively contributing to Vester, mentioning their company had been actively using it.   \n\n* People don't generally get into open source without a good reason. \n\n* A lot of people don't care about open source contributions.  If you want to do software development work, it's more about passing code exams, the school you came from, examples of code snippets you have worked on, references, and networking. \n\n* The software contributions to open source are more helpful if you’re looking for a public facing role like Developer Relations (i.e. Technical Marketing).  The job is more about cutting directly to the viewer and letting them know you know what you're talking about.  Build what you want people to understand so they can do a certain level of checking.  \n\n* Where Chris is in his career, it's way less about your GitHub profile.  \n\n## 31:08 - Startup Magic and Being a Builder \n\n* Chris thinks Rubrik didn't know who he was until they spoke to Duncan Epping.  Chris was a fan of Duncan's blog and his books, and they had networked a bit (i.e. knowing someone who knows someone).   \n\n* Chris was blogging about VMware, and the Rubrik product was going to be protecting VMware workloads.  He was an authentic voice and a good person to represent the company (Rubrik). \n\n* This was a right time, right skillset kind of thing. \n\n* Chris cites Rubrik as probably the best job he's ever had. \n\n* Chris was at a startup with 25-30 people or so with everyone excited and top of their game, completely focused on the mission of building a company.  They were not looking for a churn and burn but looking to build something big. \n\n* For years it was a small crew, and Chris had the best time of his life, feeling he'll never be able to replicate that same magic.  He would do it again in a heartbeat if he had a time machine.   \n\n* Chris probably won't do another startup at this point in his career. \n\n* John mentioned we've talked to people with similar sentiments about startups and the energy that comes from them.  Some people are a part of it and keep trying to recreate the magic at other places. \n\n* Chris says there is a nuance here.  There's the magic of the startup, much of it often coming from your first.  Chris has been a part of 3 startups. \n\n* Then there's the magic of being a builder.  Chris is a builder.  He wants to build it, see it do what it's supposed to do, and then he's ready to move on. \n\n* \"I think you can chase being a builder, but you have to respect the magic of the startup vibe and not try to chase that because it is fleeting and rare and you should respect it.\" - Chris Wahl \n\n* John says you can still feed the builder within from different positions \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-149":{"title":"Episode 149","content":"\n# Episode 149\n\nWelcome to episode 149 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Chris Wahl and discuss how Chris grew as Rubrik grew and his life as Chief Technologist, the genesis and end of Datanauts, decision trees for bringing more joy to your life, and how Chris builds connections through writing.  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 9-23-2021 \n\n[Chris Wahl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wahlchris/) is a Senior #Principal at [Slalom](https://www.slalom.com/).  He leads a team of consulting technologists who solve complex problems related to public cloud, #DevOps and many other items under the technology umbrella.  Check out part 1 of our interview with Chris in [Episode 148](https://nerd-journey.com/the-magic-of-building-with-chris-wahl-1-2/).  [[Chris Wahl]] #Slalom [[Episode 148]]\n\nTopics – A Career Time Machine, #Datanauts, Maximizing Value and Joy, Building #Connections, Parting Thoughts \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:28 - A Career Time Machine \n\n* Slalom came out of a bunch of things.  Chris had been at #Rubrik for almost 6 years and did not feel like he was adding much.  He's self-conscious of the inputs and values he provides. \n\n* Eventually Chris decided he needed to build something else and left Rubrik.  He did not have another job lined up and decided to take a break. \n\n* Chris had talked to Slalom back before Rubrik in 2015 but turned it down for Rubrik. \n\n* Out of the blue he got an e-mail from a recruiter at Slalom.  It was a really nice, personalized message. \n\n* The role at Slalom had the things that he wanted: \n\n* A local team in Austin \n\n* Wanted to work in cloud architecture with no on-premises stuff \n\n* The company valued diversity and inclusion, and Chris has been able to hire people with a broad range of unique perspectives and backgrounds (i.e. building the team he wanted to build). \n\n* At Rubrik Chris was a Tech Evangelist and flew all over the world doing tech shows. \n\n* When he went to Europe people would think he was a minister of some sort based on the title of Evangelist. \n\n* They eventually changed his title to Chief Technologist based on his suggestion. \n\n* The role was (aside from presentations and meeting people)  running Technical Marketing (which included Developer Relations, competitive teams, etc.). \n\n* It was a miniature department with subgroups.  He wanted to write blogs and make videos and made a lot of mistakes as a manager.   \n\n* Chris was a senior director at the company and had to learn a lot of things for the first time. He felt he made some mistakes but ended up with great people. \n\n* As a company grows you're expected to take on more responsibilities. \n\n* Chris felt his biggest mistake as a manger was too much time not managing / not thinking about his strategy.  He gathered a group of people, said \"let's go do some cool stuff,\" and figured that was enough.   \n\n* Sometimes it was enough, but overall this was a humbling time for Chris. \n\n* Chris had never worked for a vendor startup before Rubrik, and all of it was very new. \n\n* The biggest advice Chris would give his former self would be to remember that he has control over his destiny. \n\n* He felt he was too passive and should have taken a more active role in building his future.  That's good advice across the board to be a more active participant in your own role. \n\n* In the situation at Rubrik being a people manager was inevitable.  He might have decided (if he did it over) to build a team that was more on the engineering side of things and less on the marketing side. \n\n* Chris feels he made the right wrong decision there.  The experience working under the Chief Marketing Officer at Rubrik and running Technical Marketing gives him a lot of advantages over his peers. \n\n* At the time Chris wanted to be a little more hands on with the technology like he had been before joining the company. \n\n* There were many ups and downs, and it's never black and white but rather shades of beautiful gray. \n\n* At Slalom Chris is less technical comparatively speaking.  He can architect a solution but expects his engineers to put the pieces together for implementation. \n\n* Chris still writes Python and Terraform code as a hobby to stay sharp and up to date with how things work.  Everything else he expects the capable engineers working on his projects to deliver. \n\n* John makes a good point about architecture still being technical but a different kind of technical. \n\n* Chris said the tools he uses have changed to LucidChart ,spreadsheets, diagrams, etc. \n\n* Because of the vast experience Chris has, he is not afraid of challenges he faces stumping him. He knows he has a great team, he knows he is not alone, and there is always some way to solve it. \n\n## 14:19 - [Datanauts](https://packetpushers.net/series/datanauts-podcast/) \n\n* Chris met Ethan Banks(see also [Episode 42](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-042-ethan-banks-and-the-journey-to-career-self-awareness/) and [Episode 43](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-043-ethan-banks-on-podcasting-and-turning-a-hobby-into-the-packet-pushers/)) at Cisco Live in 2013.   \n\n* Chris was a big [Packet Pushers](https://packetpushers.net/) fan, and they happened to be at the same table for influencers.  Chris made it a point to strike up a conversation with Ethan, and the two became fast friends. \n\n* Chris and Ethan wanted to make a show about breaking down silos.  The original name was called IT Engine Builders but was later changed to [Datanauts](https://packetpushers.net/?s=datanauts). \n\n* Chris liked talking to people and building show scripts, but it got to the point where it was not fun any longer. \n\n* They built a successful show.  If Chris was no longer into it, people were going to notice. \n\n* Chris wanted to start a family, move, and had some personal ambitions. \n\n* In the beginning the two of them agreed that when one of them wanted to leave the show, it would be perfectly ok. \n\n* After Chris communicated his desire to leave the show, they recorded a nice [final episode](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/datanauts-173-goodnight-datanauts/). \n\n* Chris definitely misses doing the show but not all the other stuff that comes along with it. \n\n* Ethan and Chris created a show made of love and wanted to tell stories of people building better IT because they wanted to work together.  The concept of breaking down silos and working together was pretty new at that time. \n\n* We (Nick and John) are just being a little selfish since we loved Datanauts so much. \n\n* One of Nick's favorite Datanauts episodes is [Trials \u0026 Tribulations of Technical Blogging](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/datanauts-061-trials-tribulations-technical-blogging/). \n\n## 18:24 - Maximizing Value and Joy \n\n* What about difficulties people have letting something go even if the time is right? \n\n* Chris says ask yourself the following: \n\n* Does this make you happy? \n\n* Does this bring you joy? \n\n* Is it doing something for you and your mental wellness? \n\n* Is it helping you hit your goals? \n\n* If the answer is no, it's not the right thing…period.  You need to pivot into something else. \n\n* Chris has been doing this across the board lately.  Anything that is getting in his way, not bringing joy, not enabling what he wants out of his life…has to go. \n\n* The pandemic has really created a focus on how to get the maximum amount of value and joy out of life for Chris. \n\n* This paring down goes back to concepts discussed in [[Deep Work]] by Cal [[Cal Newport]]. \n\n\t* Check out [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/) for part 1 of our 7-part review of this book.  [[Episode 141]]\n\n* Nick mentioned this methodology also sounds similar to the approach [Jonathan Frappier](https://nerd-journey.com/riding-the-burnout-wave-with-jonathan-frappier-2-2/) took to fight back against #Burnout (i.e. the focus on self-care). [[Jonathan Frappier]]\n\n* The problem with #FOMO (fear of missing out) is that comparison is a direct road to sadness.  Comparison is the death of joy. \n\n* I don't want to compare my real life to your highlight reel. \n\n* This is the kind of thing that happens when you look at social media or investments you had to make to be part of the social media community. \n\n* It's all smoke and mirrors.  There's not a lot of tangible value there. \n\n* About 1.5 years ago, Chris backed out of using social media, coming to the realization that it did nothing for him.  He was contributing content on other people's platforms and looking at people's perfect lives through their distorted lenses.  He was unhappy and depressed. \n\n* Chris still maintains his blog.  He doesn't use Twitter, is barely on LinkedIn, and is the happiest he has ever been.  There is no FOMO, only joy.  \n\n* Now Chris focuses on him, his people, solving cool problems, and writing it down, and waking up the next day wanting to do it over again. \n\n* Chris got back 3-5 hours per day after giving up social media. \n\n* Chris feels super productive and has been laser focused this year. \n\n* The distractions are now gone.  It's been years since he has felt this creative and sharp. \n\n* It's almost like Chris read Deep Work before this episode. \n\n* See also Chris' [article on deep work](https://wahlnetwork.com/2021/10/12/an-intentional-focus-on-deep-work/) written after our recording took place. \n\n* \"You know what social media doesn't do?  It doesn't build connection.  I can't have 1000 friends.\" - Chris Wahl \n\n* The people Chris interacts with regularly that he can connect with on a personal and professional level provides more value in his life than the 14,000 people following him on Twitter. \n\n* We keep judging the value of a message based on hearts and thumbs up which does not provide a context.  It's shown to us through a certain lens. \n\n* We need to connect with other humans. \n\n* This is something Chris has come to in the last couple years in his own journey. \n\n* So many people are suffering from depression and burnout through social media and the comparison lifestyle, and Chris doesn't need any of that. \n\n* John speaks to how the sentiment Chris expressed aligns with the Deep Work Hypothesis proposed by Cal Newport.  There are deep and shallow connections with others much in the same way there is deep and shallow types of work. \n\n## 28:11 - Building Connections \n\n* Chris wanted to work where his coworkers would be local.  There is a level of safety and comfort around those he works with to be together in person. \n\n* Every organization is struggling with building connections.  Up to 50-60% of the market is looking to switch jobs because they want to feel more included with the company, its mission, and their peers. \n\n* Connection is driving people to analyze their values and be introspective of their own lifestyle. \n\n* The upheaval is causing rippling waves throughout tech.  The connections are where the joy is. \n\n* If you're watching LinkedIn, you may see people leaving your company.  It can start to impact you in a negative way or make you think others know something you don't. \n\n* The pandemic has put some extra stress on us in that it has forced us to think about what is really important. \n\n* Some people have left jobs they enjoyed for something even better. \n\n* Chris says everyone he is working with on the client side is just slammed trying to hire people. \n\n* We're seeing remote work opportunities no longer being bound to a specific area. \n\n* We should find our gratitude first.  The fact that we have these opportunities is fantastic. \n\n* Once you have found your gratitude, find where you want to find your joy and your lifestyle (i.e. what employer, what role, etc.). \n\n* This is about setting yourself up, having the skills people need, going through the process of making yourself valuable, doing good work, documenting, etc. \n\n* John says he's not certain the cycle is going to end of being able to learn new technologies quickly and being able to execute on them.  Knowledge work jobs are going to be some of the most valuable out there. \n\n* Taking the time to focus on making real, valuable connections like Chris has done can bring renewed energy into your work. \n\n* Remove the distractions of being highly connected.  Then make choices of who you connect with. \n\n* Start with having the gratitude every day. \n\n* When we talk about learning and knowledge work, it's just patterns.  There are all these patterns that have to do with building, designing, and dealing with tech. \n\n* Once you identify the patterns, it's about applying them in the situation you're in. \n\n* It will always be about learning new things, finding the patterns they fit against, and then making them work. \n\n* Chris very much enjoys today's tech stacks and can do without loading floppies in mainframes. \n\n* Aspects of the modern tech stack allow us to add more value to the business and in a way breathes more energy into us as a result. \n\n* Now, the joy comes from all the options we have to build whatever we want to build.  It's not like back in the day when we were the API.   \n\n* There's no excuse not to be thrilled about what's going on in tech these days.  It's either shift your perspective, find your gratitude, or this isn't for you. \n\n## 39:49 - Parting Thoughts \n\n* Frequent writing is a big deal. \n\n* On Chris's team at Slalom they all blog (every week) to share experiences, learnings, challenges, etc.  It's an open forum to collaborate. \n\n* If you're looking to build connections and become a better writer, start a blog with your team or the people that work for you.  Use it as a way to build the connection and to document things you have done for performance reviews. \n\n* Check out Chris' blog article on [How to Create Work Connections with Blogging](https://wahlnetwork.com/2021/09/27/how-to-create-work-connections-with-blogging/). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-15":{"title":"Episode 15","content":"\n# Episode 15\n\n1:55 Interview Myths \n\n[5 Myths About Interviews You’ll Want to Stop Believing](https://jobs.washingtonpost.com/article/5-myths-about-interviews-you-ll-want-to-stop-believing/) \n\n1)  Your Interviewer Is Completely Prepared \n\n-   They might not have read your resume \n    \n-   They might not have the job description \n    \n-   They might not have been trained how to interview \n    \n-   What to do if the interviewer is unprepared \n    \n-   Have an elevator pitch matching your skills and experience to the job description \n    \n-   Have a copy of the job description \n    \n-   Have a copy of your resume \n    \n-   Be ready to answer the questions you wish you were asked (i.e. run the interview) \n    \n\n2)  Interview Questions Have Correct and Incorrect Answers \n\n-   Good questions are designed to elicit more information about the candidate, not have right and wrong answers \n    \n-   Learn to tell your story in a way that's relevant to the role and company you're applying to \n    \n-   Listen to the Geek Whisperers Silicon Valley VMUG episodes (two of Nick's favorite) \n    \n    -

In today's episode we discuss Duwayne Engelhardt's early career and his transition from being a band director into IT operations at a bank.  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-06-2021 \n\nTopics – Meet Duwayne Engelhardt, #Band Director to #Banking, Focus on Functionality, A Manager of Change, Onboarding A New Boss and #ShowingValue, Stressful Situations, Supporting Others through Change\n[[Duwayne Engelhardt]] #Retirement #WallisBank\n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:29 - Meet Duwayne Engelhardt \n\n* [Duwayne Engelhardt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duwayne-engelhardt-68056913/) is currently retired.  He doesn't do anything he does not want to do. \n\n* Duwayne was the VP of Network Administration at Wallis Bank.  His boss told him he was the Infrastructure Architect before retiring, but before that he was a Network Administrator, Technology Director, and many other things. \n\n* Duwayne was always kind of a tech guy but primarily a musician.  Even in the 1960s, he built his own AM radio to listen to at night when no one could tell him to turn it down / off. \n\n* He started his career as a Band Director at a small school.  The situation was such that he had to find extra classes to teach like PE, Math, Texas History, and when computers came along, it was suggested he teach a class on them. \n\n* He got certified so he would not have to change the classes he taught each year. \n\n* He started with teaching things like Commodore64 machines and others. \n\n* Duwayne's wife did accounting work, and he helped her with manual ledgers, finally suggesting computer spreadsheets could do the job better.  The wife said \"go do it.\" \n\n* Duwayne picked up an Epson machine and Lotus123 to take care of it. \n\n* Duwayne used a computer a lot as a band director because he had many students and needed to keep track of students, uniforms, instruments, grades.  He had over 3 times the number of students as other teachers. \n\n* Duwayne was told he knew too much about computers to keep teaching band and not just teach computers.  He could not find another band director job and decided to \"roll with the flow.\" \n\n* Duwayne still likes to play instruments and perform these days and will often times teach kids on the side. \n\n* Music remains his first love, but he likes to play around with computers too. \n\n* John mentioned Accounting was a transformation and that people don't remember spreadsheets were once paper.   \n\n* Duwayne said his wife turned maintaining ledgers over to him and that he decided to then use the computers for his stuff. \n\n## 7:00 - Band Director to Banking \n\n* Duwayne taught what was considered basic computer information to middle school kids to start, teaching them about computers, their history, and how they developed dating back to Babbage in the 1800s. \n\n* It was computer literacy more than anything.  \n\n* When Duwayne got into the banking industry, they were not using computers.  It was green screens and mainframes but didn't really know what they were doing (data entry only).  Going to the banks was a big transition because many workstations were a hybrid between green screen / mainframe and computing. \n\n* People using the computers figured out how to screen scrape the green screen so people would not have to copy information between the two systems. \n\n* As long as the data was in the right place / field, you could get the data to go from the mainframe (thousands of miles away) to the local computer in front of you. \n\n* In education you have to teach the students what's happening so they know what to do and what not to do, what happens when you don't do something right, and how to correct it, etc. \n\n* The education part was very useful in teaching people at the bank.  The biggest difference was that in education you might have 3 servers in a school district and 200-300 users per server.  At the bank, we had 80 servers for 180 people (a very different server to user ratio).  Education doesn't require a lot of computing, but in banking these days, almost everything requires computing. \n\n* Duwayne came into technology when mainframes were still in use.  They were in the middle of processing e-mail (probably the biggest local usage of computers), and employees realized they could find the information they were looking for easily in spreadsheet form faster than manually manipulating the mainframe's screen. \n\n* The mainframe had one print option (print everything), and there was no going to look for page 7 if that was all you needed. \n\n* Duwayne was there during the transition away from mainframes and a transition to a quicker means of entering data \n\n## 11:58 - Focus on Functionality \n\n* Duwayne tried to stay 2-3 steps ahead of users to do testing and evaluate what they wanted and needed so he would know what they needed to do with any new technology. \n\n* Even in education, Duwayne found in the mid-1990s, he found an application written for Apple 2 machines (even though it was not a thing those days) that could teach elementary students language and math.  The teachers loved Duwayne for setting this up, getting excited about seeing printouts of a student's progress after using the program. \n\n* The person who came in after Duwayne brought in Windows, and it was a big learning curve for students and teachers.  You need to see what something is good for and use it for a particular function.  This does not require that it be the latest technology if it works well.   \n\n* Duwayne still does some computer work these days for people.  Listen to his story about helping a customer swap computers easily (and finding a better way to transfer settings). \n\n## 14:44 - A Manager of Change \n\n* Duwayne has been a manager of change throughout his career.  At the bank, they used NT e-mail internally only (no Exchange existed at that time - 1999). \n\n* He remembers the BSD system from the school district and found a good Linux server to use for the bank's e-mail until moving to Exchange in 2007. \n\n* Duwayne had to rebuild the server at one point right before a trip out of town  and upgraded it to Postfix, which served as the corporate mail server until they eventually migrated to change. \n\n* This is what got Duwayne started in Linux, and to this day he still runs some Linux servers at his home. \n\n* You have to use what is good for you and what is cost effective.  There is no sense in wasting money on computing when you don't have to. \n\n* The bank had higher computing requirements and more uptime requirements. \n\n* Back to the boy scout trip out of town…Duwayne had been planning to go for a while, but the e-mail server went down the day before the trip. \n\n* Duwayne's boss would not allow him to leave until he fixed the server, stating the company would pay to fly him to wherever he needed to go to at least make part of his trip. \n\n* Duwayne had to go buy a new motherboard for the server and then decided to upgrade Linux at the same time.  The hard drive was fine, which allowed Duwayne to recover all the e-mails. \n\n* Listen as Duwayne shares a story about Windstream (their datacenter communications provider at the time) making a forced change to the bank's connection (all new circuits) and external network that took 3 days to resolve. \n\n* Duwayne finally convinced a Windstream engineer that the problem had to do with packet sizes and was a misconfiguration of some Windstream equipment, sleeping very little during those 3 days as a result. \n\n* During the outage, the bank had some functionality within their network but no access to the internet (which meant no e-mail). \n\n* It was an extremely stressful time for Duwayne. \n\n* John says during times of change you really understand what fragility is. \n\n* This is the very reason Duwayne suggested the bank have multiple datacenters for redundancy. \n\n* By the time Duwayne left the bank, a datacenter failure wouldn't even be noticed by end users because an automatic failover based on redundancy was in place.  Things might be a little slower, but the functionality was there without a complete system down situation. \n\n* This type of redundancy earned the bank high marks from regulators.  John says the regulations were stricter based on the size of the bank. \n\n* When Duwayne joined the bank, they had about 65 million dollars in assets, and by the time he left to retire they were over 1 billion dollars (present day closer to 2 billion dollars). \n\n* This growth resulted in multiple regulation level changes. \n\n## 23:37 - Onboarding A New Boss and Showing Value \n\n* Duwayne's boss was a member of the family with a background in database administration.  He knew a lot but not how it all interconnected. \n\n* Duwayne taught his boss many things over the 7 years they worked together. \n\n* The boss was willing to learn.  He came in because he was the oldest son of the primary owner. \n\n* Duwayne's boss came into the role knowing he didn't know a lot of things.  Duwayne took it upon himself to help his new boss understand the technology operations at the bank.  The boss eventually fought for everything the team needed (i.e. all the improvements needed to get five 9s of availability for the bank). \n\n* Working at the bank was a great job for Duwayne.  \n\n* Duwayne says the team was told no a few times regarding some things they wanted to increase reliability and uptime.  Generally, if they kept at it and could demonstrate a return on the investment within 6 months, projects would get approved to introduce new capabilities. \n\n* John didn't learn the lesson of demonstrating business value while in IT Operations.  It was something he learned in pre-Sales. \n\n* Duwayne grew up doing this.  If he wanted something, it was up to him to prove the value of what he wanted.  If there was value and a workable return on investment, things got approved. \n\n* Duwayne tried to use these same skills while teaching.  In the school systems there were more politics.  Administrators would have direct access to the board, but you needed to convince an administrator something was a good idea first. \n\n* Presenting the business case to leadership within the banking industry was easier for Duwayne.  His motto was that he would spend the bank's money like it was his own (i.e. won't ask for something the bank really did not need). \n\n* Duwayne never abused the trust upper management put in him at the bank, sticking to the plan of providing a valid business case for return on investment to help leaders understand.  If you can do something to make the business run better, more power to you. \n\n## 28:58 - Stressful Situations \n\n* Close to the time COVID hit, technology teams had already added a few hours to their normal day to support branches in different time zones without adding IT personnel. \n\n* Employees wanted to work late into the night on loan applications.  Duwayne and team had to figure out how to adjust their data backup schedules as a result (when to do it, how to do it, what timeline for recovery is). \n\n* One of the servers was overloaded and nearly out of space.  Duwayne had created a script to move files and ran it early one morning.  A couple of hours later a co-worker called and stated a specific file share was completely empty (the one that was supposed to be copied to a new server). \n\n* Duwayne's script had accidentally done the copy in the wrong direction and wiped out all the data. \n\n* Luckily Duwayne had a redundant copy of the data that was fairly up to date.  He was able to recover everything but a small number of files.   \n\n* This taught Duwayne an important lesson.  Get a second set of eyes on scripts before running them in production when you're about to make a big change. \n\n* There was a lot of stress on IT personnel in supporting other company personnel moving from a 14 hour day to a 24 hour day (with no added IT staff). \n\n* Some of the best advice Duwayne has received is don't skip on backup.  You never have enough of it.  There will come a time when you need that 3rd copy. \n\n* Even though he is retired now, Duwayne works with a few small businesses and encourages them to never skimp on backups. \n\n* Sometimes an ok day can turn into a red alert, all hands on deck kind of situation.  How do you deal with the stress of these kinds of situations over the course of a career? \n\n* Duwayne says he's not sure you ever learn to deal with it.  You just deal with it.   \n\n* It helps if you have a manager above you who can provide consistent status updates to upper management.  This takes the heat off the team working on resolving the problem. \n\n* A co-worker of Duwayne's sat in a cubicle and try to work while people hovered over him during a stressful situation.  Duwayne, on the other hand, had an office door he could close. \n\n* Duwayne's boss (a Senior Vice President) would let people know the team was aware of the outage and that they were working to resolve it as quickly as possible.  But there were limits to how fast the team could work and how fast processes could move. \n\n## 36:04 - Supporting Others through Change \n\n* Platforms changed a few times over Duwayne's career. \n\n* Usually people came to Duwayne with banking applications with his job being to make it work. \n\n* Duwayne was more on the networking side, transitioning from frame relay to nVPN (VPN managed by carriers) to basic multi-site units with routing to SD-WAN. \n\n* His goal was consistently to lessen the overall impact on end users during these changes (i.e. minimal downtime). \n\n* Even back in the 90s they were running their voice traffic over frame relay for branch communication. \n\n* Some moves were made with no downtime at all, but usually users recognized the improvement. \n\n* The change to SD-WAN was the most complicated and had the most downtime due to the changes needed (not the same as a simple redirection). \n\n* Nick says the job of the IT professional is to be invisible.  Duwayne says we are enablers.  We enable end users to do their jobs.  The better we can do that and the less they have to talk to us (IT), the better they like it (and the better we like it). \n\n* If users complain / talk about something be \"slow,\" ideally we would fix it without them knowing it so they will be able to see the difference and can report a positive change. \n\n* Duwayne says there were some users who would come and thank him or a member of his team when something was fixed, being very generous with their gratitude. The users appreciated the effort IT put in to help them, and the IT group understood the end users they supported were making money for the company. \n\n* Duwayne enjoyed working with most end users and on the back end systems.  He likes communicating and talking with people, so interacting with end users was never an issue.   \n\n* Duwayne had to reinforce to the people who worked for him that the people the team supported were the ones making the company money to pay IT salaries.   \n\n* Take care of them (end users).  They may not be right.  You can't really change it except to make it better. \n\n*  At one point Duwayne was the Information Security Officer at the bank. \n\n* Duwayne told one of the presidents he could shut the bank down if the situation arose / risk was great enough. \n\n* Duwayne shares a story of someone wanting to know the passwords of all tellers working under her, but this would have been a compliance issue.  Duwayne shut it down, and his boss supported the decision. \n\n* The Information Security Officer works very closely with the Compliance Officer. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-151":{"title":"Episode 151","content":"\n# Episode 151\n\nWelcome to episode 151 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

Spiceworks: The Software and the Community \n\n* Duwayne's first interaction with Spiceworks was using their free help desk software.  He was using a software package from a large vendor that was discontinued. \n\n* Duwayne didn't realize the [Spiceworks community](https://community.spiceworks.com/) existed until over 500,000 users had joined it. \n\n* The people he came across and interacted with in the community were both knowledgeable and helpful.  If somoene made a suggestion that didn't work, Duwayne could go back and ask the person again. \n\n* Interestingly enough, Duwayne at one time followed John White in the community for learning and sharing purposes. \n\n* Duwayne was a [SpiceLeader](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps/be-a-spiceleader) for the [Houston area SpiceCorps](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps/houston).  For more detail on what SpiceCorps is, check out [this page](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps). \n\n* As a result of this, Duwayne met a number of vendors whose products could actually help him move projects at the bank forward. \n\n* It was technology that made IT professionals' jobs easier.  Duwayne loved sharing with other IT professionals who might not have had time to do the necessary research \n\n* Most of the time there was no need to create something from scratch (i.e. a script, etc.).  Duwayne could look at what others had done and make tweaks to suit his environment.  \n\n* SpiceCorps was a user group that began from people using the Spiceworks product.  People would meet to share experiences and help new users get more out of the application.   \n\n* Eventually vendors began to sponsor parts of meetings, providing refreshments to attendees for a chance to plug their products.  Attendees liked the fact that technical representatives from the vendor would come out and answer questions on how the technology could help them. \n\n* As the Spiceworks application was updated less frequently, SpiceLeaders like Duwayne needed to focus more on bringing in vendors for sponsorship. \n\n* Nick has been the co-leader of the SpiceCorps of Dallas / Fort Worth and references some of the activities from [past meetings](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps/dallas-fort-worth/meetings?filter=past) \n\n* Taking 1-1.5 hours out of an IT professional's day / week is taking valuable time.  Attending a meeting like a SpiceCorps is someone intentionally spending their own time.  The work is not going to go away and probably will have to be made up by an attendee some other time.  These types of meetings have to be fun, interesting, and worthwhile to get people to show up. \n\n* John always found the community around the Spiceworks application really interesting because he spent very little time using Spiceworks software.  It was the discussion forums on networking, storage, compute, virtualization and others which served as a great way to educate people looking to break into the industry / learn on the fly. \n\n* John got so much out of the community but has not really had much time to be a part of it over the last few years. \n\n* Spiceworks originally helped Duwayne a lot (the software that did inventory and help desk). \n\n* There were a number of applications built up around the Spiceworks community like [PDQ](https://www.pdq.com/).  This company had tremendous growth because of Spiceworks and was a far less expensive alternative than Microsoft tooling. \n\n* Duwayne met the founders of PDQ back when it was Admin Arsenal at [Spiceworld](https://www.spiceworks.com/spiceworld/), learned about the capabilities, started with the free version of PDQ, and eventually needed to invest in the paid version because of regulations and the need to keep applications up to date.  It filled a gap in the Spiceworks application capabilities and eventually became the tool to use for inventory with Spiceworks being used more for ticketing. \n\n* Duwayne shares the story of when he began using Spiceworks as a replacement to a product that changed corporate ownership and became more expensive. \n\n* From 2007 - 2015 the Spiceworks application was a big deal, but at some point along Spiceworks decided to be a marketing company that put vendors in touch with IT pros.  The focus on the app seemed to go down a bit, leaving the community as the biggest value. \n\n* Duwayne mentions knowing Nick and John via the community long before we all met in person. \n\n* Because people were friendly and willing to share it made the community great.  It was good friendship and fellowship.  What else can you ask of life?  If you have that, you have it all. \n\n* People who participate in communities like this are doing it on their own time. \n\n* We may not all have the knowledge of some folks we come across in communities.  But if we can ask a question of somoene who has been there and get back a helpful response, it saves time and energy. \n\n* Picking people's brains is extremely helpful, and it allows you to build connections and friendships.  People in Spiceworks pushed John to dream bigger and better himself.  You may not have this in your mind until someoene brings it up. \n\n## 17:30 - Money Isn't Everything \n\n* When Duwayne got the network administrator job at Wallis Bank, it was 5 miles from his home without him needing to drive to Houston. \n\n* Despite the fact that Duwayne likely could have received better pay by going to Houston he liked the flexibility of going to and coming home from work at a decent hour.  He also did not have to relocate. \n\n* Duwayne was not a job hopper and has only had 3 jobs in his career.  Moving to large companies was not for him. \n\n* Duwayne identified what was important to him and made the decision based on that.  Not everyone has the presence of mind to do this. \n\n* You can learn it early or learn it late, but eventually you will want a place to call home, a place to relax and get away from thigs.  \"Always being at the top is not always where you want to be.\" - Duwayne Engelhardt \n\n## 20:11 - Transitioning into Retirement \n\n* On the business side, Duwayne had multiple projects he wanted to complete and document to leave things in a good state for the next person. \n\n* About 6 months before he left, he talked with the team about what needed to be tied up before his last day.  They have known for years Duwayne planned to retire, and his successor was hired about 3 years before his departure. \n\n* Duwayne had worked on a small team and was a subject matter expert in many areas of the technology landscape for the bank.  They needed time for knowledge transfer. \n\n* Duwayne's wife had quit work due to too much stress.  She called him one day and asked him if he'd mind her quitting.  He told her to go for it. \n\n* They had been transitioning off her salary in the year before that to help them get used to lower income and retirement.  Though she quit earlier than they may have wanted, it did not hurt them. \n\n* Before making the decision to retire, Duwayne and his wife looked at their finances and even spoke with a financial advisor to confirm they were in good shape. \n\n* Duwayne wanted to start taking extra money after he retired while they were still young enough to enjoy it. \n\n* As soon as Duwayne retired, he started working on the house to prepare for a big retirement blow out party his wife wanted to host (16 hour days for 6 weeks). \n\n* There was a freeze that wiped out part of her garden before this that needed replacing before they had company.  \n\n* Duwayne's wife told him after the party he could do what he wanted. \n\n* Duwayne wanted to transition to a solo guitar vocal career to get some extra money and do something enjoyable. \n\n* Because of COVID there has not been a lot of traction here, but some of the performances are now starting to pick up a bit. \n\n* Duwayne has also done a lot of YouTube learning. With COVID popular guitarists were not touring.  Many of them picked up YouTube channels, which allowed Duwayne to improve his playing. \n\n* As of the October recording date, Duwayne had been retired for 7 months. \n\n* So far retirement been enjoyable.  He and his wife have been on a number of trips together (with more to come). \n\n* From a finance perspective, they are making it just fine. \n\n* Duwayne's wife has taken up sewing in her retirement, putting her new sewing machine to good use making quilts, table runners, placemats, etc. \n\n* Duwayne's wife is a talented artist who has been doing some very interesting things with wine bottles (usually as gifts). \n\n* In the same way, Duwayne often gives his music away for free. \n\n* Now if Duwayne's phone rings late at night it could only be a family concern.  His parents and siblings are getting up in age. \n\n* He still has a couple of customers, running his own small managed service provider (MSP) helping out some very small businesses like a small dental office in a neighboring town that had not made any infrastructure upgrades since 2009. \n\n* Duwayne built a small network for them with some virtual machines, including implementing a system for daily backups and effective rotation. \n\n* Another customer of Duwayne's had a computer crash.  The person had been using Outlook as a file cabinet for a number of years. \n\n## 28:57 - Advice for Others Planning to Retire and Parting Thoughts \n\n* Save money early on, and don't touch it if you can help it. \n\n* Duwayne knows many people who are living on social security alone and aren't too happy with the things they are able to do as a result. \n\n* Sacrifice a little early on, and see where it goes.  Compound interest is powerful over years.  You may think two or three years is no big deal.   Turning that into 20 to 40 years can make a huge difference in your retirement. \n\n* Being able to do what he wants to do in retirement is a big deal for Duwayne. \n\n* Plan for something outside of computers.   \n\n* Duwayne has maintained a membership in cybersecurity organizations like Infraguard and has had a focus there for 26 years.  It's hard to transition off of it, but he has been able to fill his time in retirement with other things he enjoys. \n\n* Family and friends are a big part of retirement.  The fact that they can spend more time with the important people makes life a lot better. \n\n* IT professionals forget they are helping others.  If you keep that in mind it makes all the work seem less work. \n\n* Transition to the idea that you're not working for yourself. You're not working for the company but rather the people at the company. \n\n* When it comes time to retire you'll have a lot of friends who will be there for you. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-152":{"title":"Episode 152","content":"\n# Episode 152\n\nWelcome to episode 152 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Scott Lowe, getting his thoughts on life as a principal engineer, and progression from technical instructor to blogger and writer.  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-21-2021 \n\nTopics – A #Principal Engineer, Thoughts on [[Managing People is a Different Skill Set Than Being an Individual Contributor|People Management]], The #TechnicalClassroom, #Sharing Information with a Purpose, Paid to Write, #Blogs to #Books \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:41 - A Principal Engineer \n\n* [Scott Lowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottslowe/) is a Principal Field Engineer at [Kong](https://konghq.com/) and has been with the company since mid-May 2021.  Find Scott's blog at [[https://blog.scottlowe.org/](https://blog.scottlowe.org/)](https://blog.scottlowe.org/](https://blog.scottlowe.org/)).\n   [[Scott Lowe]] #Kong  \n\n* Scott has been working his way up through the ranks as an individual contributor over the years.  He left VMware in 2018 to join [Heptio](https://www.vmware.com/company/acquisitions/heptio.html) as a Staff Engineer.   #VMware #Heptio\n\n* They were a small company of about 50 people at the time Scott joined, and there was a roadmap for going beyond Staff level. \n\n* Moving up beyond Staff level was to be a leader without being a manager. \n\n* When Scott came back into VMware after the Heptio acquisition he entered at the Senior Staff level.  The role is about how you're helping others in their roles (mentoring other engineers, architects). \n\n* At Kong, Scott is one of 3 Principal Engineers.  The path of advancement as an individual contributor would be Distinguished Engineer and then Fellow from this level. \n\n* The Principal Engineer is about how you're influencing your team, driving best practices and efficiencies for the company.  Are we interacting with others in the greater industry and becoming leaders within the industry. \n\n* This trend continues beyond Principal.  Distinguished and Fellow are considered more career-level achievements.  It's the culmination of work and experience in the industry.  Scott is excited to pursue these but has a lot of work to do. \n\n* For Scott, the Principal role is really about leveling up all the people around him, sharing his knowledge and what he learns, making sure others are adequately prepared for their endeavors. \n\n* A Principal role can be in pre-sales, post-sales, or roles that are a mix of each.  Scott's role is mostly post-sales.  Think of it like being within a professional services organization, but the main metric is not utilization.  It's more about making an impact for the overall organization and could be things like assisting marketing with materials, supporting a conference or community meetup, creating a reference architectures, etc. \n\n* Is the Principal role like a team lead or tech lead? \n\n* In some organizations you might look at Staff / Senior Staff / Principal as a tech lead / practice lead.  It's not a given but rather \"could\" be that way. \n\n* Scott's team has not chosen to embrace this because there are pros and cons to that approach. \n\n* Sometimes you'll see tech leads divided up based on a specific technology area, but it could also be divided up by industries like Healthcare, FinServe, etc. \n\n* It's a matter of finding which is the right fit at the right time during a company's growth stage.  Structures may have to change to accommodate growth. \n\n## 9:02 - Thoughts on People Management \n\n* Scott said staying an individual contributor may have been partially due to fear of failure.  He knows he can and has done well as an individual contributor. \n\n* Scott has had opportunities to do amazing things in his career and plans to continue to do amazing things as long as he's able. \n\n* Scott knows how to be a leader while still being an individual contributor. [[Management vs. Leadership]]\n\n* Scott says his wife is his people interaction spirit animal (perhaps a Sherpa), and he's talked to her a great deal about different situations.  She can strike up a conversation with anyone, and her insights have taught him a great deal. \n\n* Scott thinks his focus on enabling others to be successful could help him become a people manager.  He believes a manager to be someone whose primary role is to clear the way for team members to do amazing things, making sure people have the time, runway, and resources. \n\n* Scott has shied away from being a people manager primarily because his greatest job satisfaction is found in being close to the technology.  Getting too far away from it might cause him to lose passion and zeal to figure out how things work and a way to explain it to others. \n\n## 11:53 - The Technical Classroom \n\n* Scott has been passionate about computers and technology even before his first few jobs. \n\n* Scott got a job for a company that was training pharmaceutical salespeople in the 1990s.  The salespeople would carry around laptops with software that had to be launched and then used a dial up connection to synchronize database information on their customer visits.   \n\n* The company was particular about skills as an instructor.  If you were not training a customer, you were training on how to be a better instructor.  They also wanted instructors spoke the customer's language.   \n\n* The company would have instructors do ride-alongs with the customer to learn their terminology and jargon so it could be leveraged to train the salespeople. \n\n* Scott traveled around carrying several giant laptops and trained a number of people. \n\n* Windows 95 was about to be released, and his company wanted people to train on it.  Scott volunteered to do the training and went deep on how it worked, how it was different than what had been used previously. \n\n* Scott found that the teaching more so than the instructing was extremely enjoyable.   \n\n* He then left to work for a company that did Microsoft training and became a Microsoft certified trainer, delivering technical courses to people looking to get certified. \n\n* The company Scott was working for had an interesting relationship with a VAR (value added reseller).  Instructors would consult for the VAR as time allowed, and consultants from the VAR would come teach courses when they had time.  This is how Scott got a taste for consulting, which has been a large part of his career. \n\n* When interviewing a number of years later with Craig McLuckie for a position at Heptio, Scott was asked if there was a theme to his career (not having thought much about it before then).   \n\n* He told Craig it was education and teaching people.  Even as a consultant, there was an element of it.  For Scott it's about sharing knowledge and making sure others are equipped to do amazing things.  \n\n* Scott never considered a career as a classroom teacher in a high school or other institution.  Scott's wife was a teacher before she became a real estate agent, so he had some perspective on that life. \n\n* His love was for the technical classroom. \n\n* For Microsoft classes, the curriculum was well defined.  You had to attend the course before teaching it. \n\n* Scott was able to leverage his own style and judgement within the curriculum to get good reviews from students. \n\n* If you want to teach someone else something, it's important to understand how you learn but know there are other styles and modes of learning. \n\n* Some students were referred to as Lewis and Clark-ers because they might be off exploring when it was not time to work on a lab exercise (i.e. tinkering on the computer when the instructor was talking / explaining something). \n\n* Scott recognizes that he has to go off and explore things when learning something new.  As he taught others and recognized the tendency in them he was able to tailor his teaching to address that. \n\n* \"If you're off exploring right now, pay attention.\" - Scott Lowe \n\n* Scott learned many things from his wife's experience in teaching that informed his style of conveying education to others. \n\n* Nick makes the point that there are educational opportunities out there for all of us.  We can teach others we work with as well as learn from them, which makes us all better. \n\n* That process of sharing expertise over the course of your career is part of the expectation of being in a senior individual contributor role.  There is an expectation for you to share knowledge. \n\n* The more you can share with and empower people on the team, the more you will be seen as a leader on that team. \n\n* Nick makes the comparison to someone with a jar of silly putty and using it filling holes. \n\n## 23:27 - Sharing Information with a Purpose \n\n* Some people seem to feel like the more they hold onto the knowledge they have the more valuable they become and are therefore more valuable to the company. \n\n* Scott thinks the more you tie yourself to certain information the more you limit yourself.  Sharing the information with others can free you up to go on and do other things. \n\n* Scott references \"the best way to get yourself promoted is to make yourself replaceable.\" \n\n* If you have empowered others to step in and take your role you can be freed up to go on and tackle something else. \n\n* At the same time the \"something new\" can produce fear, playing on our loss aversion (losing what we have in our current role). \n\n* This desire to share information is responsible in some way for Scott getting into blogging, even if he didn't realize it. \n\n* Scott started writing on his site in 2005.  For a time it was an internal only site that was part of his consulting business which ran on his own server infrastructure (a Wordpress site).  \n\n* It began as a way to document things he had figured out to come back and find later. \n\n* Scott's public blog today serves the same purpose (i.e. go find how he did something), but looking back, what drove him to make the site public was sharing the information with others. \n\n*Over time knowledge gets compacted down and becomes a bedrock.  It’s that foundation of knowledge that allows you to reach new levels of expertise in a particular area by layering things on a little at a time (i.e. personal gains and improvement).  But, the sharing of the information makes others better. \n\n* Scott has received a number of encouraging e-mails over the years from people who found his blog and used it to solve a problem.  That type of encouragement, knowing that you helped someone solve a problem in a time of need, makes it all worthwhile for Scott. \n\n* Nick mentions this is similar to encouragement a technical instructor can get from positive student feedback.  \n\n* What about a blogging cadence? \n\n* Early on Scott was a blogging machine, doing probably 8-12 posts per months.  This was in the early days of VMware taking off (2006 / 2007 / 2008 / 2009) and so much to write about. \n\n* There were a number of other bloggers like Duncan Epping and Frank Denneman.   \n\n* One could easily publish daily if you had the time.  Scott wrote a lot in the beginning, and it's slowed a little over the years.  Now he will do between 4 and 6 posts per month. \n\n* Some people say you need a specific cadence.  Others say you should be laser focused on a specific subject matter area.  Scott says he gets plenty of traffic, page rank, etc. and doesn't do any of those things.   \n\n* \"If you enjoy it (blogging), just go ahead and do it.  And all the rest of it…it will all work itself out.\" - Scott Lowe \n\n* Nick believes if you start writing and you enjoy it you will never run out of ideas. \n\n* Should I blog to stand out even if I'm not a great writer? \n\n* Scott's opinion here is if you are blogging because you want to get more visibility because it might lead to a better job, he's not convinced that is the right reason to do it. \n\n* People will say you should go blog and do it a certain way (with SEO rules).  Scott believes you should write or blog because the act of creating content whether video, audio, written form, a set of sample code files, etc. all forms of content become mechanisms to enable and empower others.  If your goal is to enable and empower others, get in and do it.  If you don’t enjoy it, try sticking with it for a little while. \n\n* If you get into blogging strictly for financial reasons, Scott believes you will end up burning out, and your content will be a flash in the pan rather than something that has staying power because it's coming from a place of deep commitment and conviction within your character (because you believe the information is useful, could be to inform or to entertain). \n\n* Create the content because it's a passion for you and not to get followers or free stuff. \n\n* Is this the heart of principal level work? \n\n* Senior level team members are expected to guide and mentor junior members of the team.  You will develop these qualities if you are sharing content with the purpose of empowering and enabling others. \n\n## 35:33 - Paid to Write \n\n* Scott was paid to write articles for Tech Target for a couple of years.  This was at the same time Scott D Lowe was writing articles for Tech Republic. \n\n* For Scott, bogging is a passion.  Through it he is able to share the enjoyment he gains from figuring something out.  It's proven true that others have found value in the information in ways Scott didn't necessarily anticipate. \n\n* When you write for pay, you need to write something.  It doesn't matter if you're inspired.  You have a deadline, and that's how it is. \n\nIf Scott had an idea on what to write about, the fact that he was writing for pay was irrelevant.  He had an opinion or a stance to work with to write what he needed to write. \n\n* Overall, Scott enjoyed the opportunity to write and is glad he did it.  When the writing becomes a job like this, you can be uninspired to write (because it may not be coming from a place of commitment and passion within you). \n\n* He sometimes was able to pick the topic when writing for Tech Target but was sometimes told they wanted an article on a specific topic. \n\n* If Scott had stayed in it longer, there may have been topics he decided not to write about (despite someone else wanting him to do so). \n\n* Scott worked with a number of great editors to publish the work that showed up on Tech Target. \n\n* We've had guests on the show whose hobby became a their eventual job that had to find other creative outlets for hobbies. \n\n* Scott has been fortunate to have great managers who recognized that he can add value in a number of ways which may not seem like they do at first glance. \n\n* Scott would take something he learned on his own and share it with the team to improve what they are doing. \n\n* He's able to channel creative energy this way, going and figuring out how some new technology works and then adding the element of sharing with others. \n\n* Nick mentions the intent is important to notice.  The things Scott is doing are coming from a place of humility.  He knows things shared may help someone years after they are shared. \n\n* Scott shared an example from 2011 / 2012 and his work on Open vSwitch.   Someone contacted him 5 years later stating the content was extremely valuable.  There are other examples of the work he did on integrating Linux / Solaris with Active Directory. \n\n* Sometimes the payoff is delayed, but it's still there. \n\n* This goes back to the why behind blogging and sharing that Scott already mentioned.  For Scott it comes from a place of wanting to pave a path to make it easier for others to follow. \n\n## 43:34 - Blogs to Books \n\n* The first book he wrote happened around 2009.  A colleague of Scott's was offered to write a book but could not do it.  Scott agreed to do it, and that's how Mastering vSphere version 4 came to be. \n\n* The book became a runaway success and led him into doing Mastering vSphere 5 as a follow up. \n\n* Writing a book is a very different thing than writing a blog post.  It's a ton of work. \n\n* We are more than just our job.  We have families, friends, etc. \n\n* When given the opportunity to write the book, Scott sat his family down and shared just how much work he believed would be involved.  His kids were younger at the time, and it was important that the entire family bought into it. \n\n* The kids would need to help around the house and help their mother. \n\n* Scott had wanted to write a book for a number of years. \n\n* He's an avid reader of fiction even though he writes technology books. \n\n* Scott had tried in the past to chase writing a book, but it did not happen.  About 6 months after he decided it would happen when the time was right, the opportunity landed in his lap. \n\n* It took about 4.5 - 5 months to write the book. \n\n* The first copies rolled out at VMworld in 2009. \n\n* It seems like many folks who have been successful in the technology industry have written books. \n\n* Scott believes that writing is powerful in many ways.  It is crucial to what we do as information / knowledge workers.  So much of our everything is in written form, which is so incredibly central to what we are as a people. \n\n* Spending the time to make yourself better at writing pays off in so many other ways (i.e. more effective description of the why behind an upgrade, better structure, better understanding of others' arguments, etc.). \n\n* This comes out of understanding how our language works, using our language, and conversing in that language (any language) gives you power to be more effective as an individual, a communicator, and as a leader. \n\n* All of these things are so intermeshed in the career ladder…being able to make yourself effective at broadening your sphere of influence and having the company recognize it (and get promoted as a result). \n\n* Be careful stepping in to write a book because it is a whole different animal.  \n\n* Scott has written 8 books, so what is going on here? \n\n* Scott has heard someone use the analogy that writing a book is like giving birth to a baby.  It's extremely hard and painful, but after it's finished and you look back, you don't remember that pain until you're in the midst of writing another book. \n\n* It's the growth that brings the joy. \n\n* Agreeing to write a book doesn't mean you know everything about a topic when you begin. \n\n* Just like writing a blog post or teaching something to somoene else, it solidifies your own understanding of the topic.  \n\n* At the time Scott wrote his book on vSphere they were using beta code.  Screenshots would have to be updated every time new code was released in those days because the interface may have changed slightly. \n\n* But there is so much learning that happens in this process because you are forced to embrace everything you are writing and really understand it.  Scott was very familiar with vSphere when he began work on the books but still learned a great deal through the process of writing [Mastering vSphere 4](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Computer-Tech/dp/0470481382) as well as [Mastering vSphere 5](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Scott-Lowe/dp/0470890800/). \n\n* Nick remembers using the vSphere 5 book when pursuing his certification years ago.  Scott says they didn't intend to make it a certification guide but that many found it helpful in working toward the certification. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-153":{"title":"Episode 153","content":"\n# Episode 153\n\nWelcome to episode 153 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Scott Lowe, tackling topics like time management  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-21-2021 \n\n[Scott Lowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottslowe/) is a Principal Field Engineer at [Kong](https://konghq.com/) and has been with the company since mid-May 2021.  Find Scott's blog at [[https://blog.scottlowe.org/](https://blog.scottlowe.org/)](https://blog.scottlowe.org/](https://blog.scottlowe.org/)), and check out part 1 of our interview with him from [Episode 152](https://nerd-journey.com/the-theme-of-your-career-with-scott-lowe-1-2/).  \n[[Scott Lowe]] #Kong [[Episode 152]]\n\nTopics – The #TimeManagement Crunch; #Generalists, #Specialists, and #Adjacencies; Thoughts on #Startup Life; The #FullStack Career Journey and Closing Thoughts \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:53 - The Time Management Crunch \n\n* As projects get larger (i.e. taking on things like writing books), how do you change your focus and manage time effectively? \n\n* Scott has talked quite a bit about time management but still feels like it is an area in which he could improve.  Maybe the thinking you could improve is part of this and what drives us to continue to gather knowledge. \n\n* It's all about tradeoffs.  Earlier in Scott's technology career he made the decision to minimize the amount of TV he watched. \n\n* Family is a big priority for Scott.  He would spent an hour or so with the family each evening. \n\n* One of the things he liked to ensure was that his family had dinner together every evening to talk about what happened during the day.  It was a nice way to stay connected to his kids, even if they didn't care or understand what he did every day. \n\n* The process of sharing what was important let the kids know they were important. \n\n* Often times the family would watch a show together or read a book together. \n\n* Once the kids went off to do their own thing, he went back to write a blog post or work on his book, for example.   \n\n* Over the course of an evening you could spend 3 or 4 hours sitting in front of the TV doing almost nothing. \n\n* Part of that time could certainly be used to bond with family, but there is likely some amount of time to use for other things. \n\n* Back when he had to go to the office, Scott would pack his lunch and work on something of his own choosing during that time (learning something new, a personal project, etc.). \n\n* Look at what you are doing with your time, and ask yourself if it could be used more effectively for your career. \n\n* Many people with commutes would listen to podcasts during their commute, for example.   \n\n* Scott hasn't had a commute in 10 years but recently started listening to podcasts again while walking his dogs. \n\n* Ask yourself if you're making the most of the time when you do spend it on building your career. \n\n* Make sure you're not just busy for the sake of being busy.  Don't spend all your time tweaking your productivity system. Scott has been there. \n\n* There are ways to track your tasks (to-do list, a system like [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563)) and ways to save things to come back to later (i.e. a helpful URL to read, etc.). \n\n* Build systems to ensure the least amount of mental expenditure so you're not worried you will forget to do something later. \n\n* Then there is what's next.   \n\n* This has come up a lot when people want to learn something new but feel they are super busy in their day job. \n\n* There's no silver bullet here.  Scott tends to look for trends that he sees emerging.  The only way to this is to read quite a bit. \n\n* Scott uses a RSS reader to track around 150-200 blogs regularly and scans for trends in what people are talking about in their articles, looking for how this impacts what he has already learned (i.e. does it add to it, extend it, etc.).  This is how you decide what to do with the time. \n\n* To review, there are 3 aspects: \n\n* Finding the time \n\n* Making the most of the time \n\n* Nick recommends minimizing distractions here. \n\n* Decide what to do with the time using the lens of what's next \n\n* Scott says right now there are so many things he could go after. \n\n* He has to limit what he pursues at present to those things more applicable to his day job.  This would be things that are only one adjacent area away at most. \n\n* Scott and his wife have no children at home right now, which makes independent exploration a bit easier. \n\n* When he did have young kids at home, Scott made the decision not to travel so he could connect with them. \n\n* You can prioritize family time appropriately, but there are spaces of time you can find to listen to a technical podcast while you work out or exercise, for example.  There will be ways to still invest in yourself. \n\n## 15:00 - Generalists, Specialists, and Adjacencies \n\n* Scott has debated this with people in the past, feeling like there may have been an episode of Geek Whisperers on this topic. \n\n* There's a concept of the pie-shaped skillset and a T-shaped skillset. \n\n* The T-shape usually means you are super deep in one area but have some knowledge of a number of others. \n\n* The pie shape usually indicates a deep expertise in one area ends up leading you into the next area of expertise. \n\n* Scott feels like the debate of generalist vs. specialist is a non-debate and that it is taken in the context of time. \n\n* Over the course of his career Scott has done storage, virtualization, cloud computing, operating systems, some programming, racking and stacking of servers, help desk support, etc.   \n\n* Looking at all of this holistically you might say Scott is a generalist.  But at any one point in time he was focused in the specific area and whatever skillset he was preparing to do next. \n\n* When Scott was focused on storage and the opportunity came to shift his focus, he didn't forget everything he knew about storage.  He built onto it knowledge of networking, virtualization, and other things. \n\n* As IT Professionals we cannot afford to be static.  Technology is not going to stop…even when the robots take over. \n\n* Technology is constantly changing.  If you call yourself a Technology Professional, your profession is something that is constantly changing.  You have to be prepared to change as your profession changes.  \"If you don't like change, you will like irrelevance even less.\" - army general \n\n* If you don't embrace the change you will get left behind and miss out on the things that could make your career amazing.  We need to be prepared to see opportunities for ourselves.  Be watching and looking for those opportunities. \n\n* At any given time you will be specializing in something, but over the course of time, you will likely end up a generalist due to specialization in a number of areas. \n\n* Scott believes there will be 1,2, or maybe 3 areas where you will be deeper than others.  But he believes you can cultivate that depth. \n\n* He does not know as much about vSphere as he once did but has learned a great deal about AWS and Kubernetes. \n\n* \"Implementation details may change, but concepts will still apply.\" - Scott Lowe \n\n* A GSX VM is not so different from an AWS EC2 instance. \n\n* When asked how to learn new things, Scott advises focusing on the concepts first.  \n\n* Greg Farrow of [Packet Pushers](https://packetpushers.net/)  said you can learn about how Cisco does BGP, for example, but when you switch to a Juniper device you will have to learn how they do it.  But if you learn BGP concepts first (i.e. transferrable knowledge), the implementation details become easier regardless of the vendor's implementation. [[Packet Pushers]]\n\n* The reality is that very few people will learn by reading a bunch of [RFCs](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/). \n\n* Most people will learn by seeing how the RFCs are put into practice by choosing a specific implementation of it (i.e. a vendor flavor).  Coming into this with a concept centric focus will allow the mind to separate a command Cisco uses for some configuration with what is actually happening behind the scenes (the underlying concept). \n\n* The right time to move into what's next is a tough one to answer.  On one hand waiting until you're ready may be too late.  There is a certain level of readiness you need before making the leap, but that level will depend on someone's comfort level with being uncomfortable. \n\n* Scott might not encourage someone to make a radical shift early on in their career unless they were in some way prepared for that change. \n\n* Scott references [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124) by Cal Newport that talked about finding opportunities by going very deep in an area and proceeding into the adjacent possible for new opportunities. [[So Good They Can't Ignore You]]\n\n* Scott is also planning to read [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) by Cal Newport soon. [[Deep Work]] [[Cal Newport]]\n\n* For more on Deep Work, check out our 7-part review of the book starting with [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/) and concluding with [Episode 147](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-7-become-hard-to-reach/). [[Episode 141]] [[Episode 147]]\n\n* Here's an example.  Suppose you're a hard core network expert, have designed LANs and WANs, and worked with multiple vendor implementations. \n\n* If you see Kubernetes come along and decide you want it to be your focus but have not done any prep work, Scott sees that as the equivalent of jumping into the deep end of a pool without knowing how to swim. \n\n* On one hand, don't wait until you're ready because there is always a fear and discomfort when you do something new.  At the same time you need to lay a foundation. \n\n* This can be as simple as making connections between concepts in the new area and the area you already know. \n\n* To you, Kubernetes will look like a new kind of network because Kubernetes does networking differently.  Take the knowledge you have and expand it a little to learn (incrementally) about pods, CNI, and services that are Kubernetes concepts. \n\n* You can gradually go deeper from there.   \n\n* That prep work is in the adjacent possible (right next to what you're doing right now so you can build connections to things you previously didn't know which gives you a foothold to go and do something new). \n\n* For our thoughts on generalists vs. specialists, check out [Episode 26](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-026-generalist-specialist-divide/). \n\n## 29:57 - Thoughts on Startup Life \n\n* The size of a company and age / maturity of a company align differently to people's preferences.  For Scott, he enjoys the dynamic nature of a smaller company and the ability to do different things. \n\n* Scott joined VMware in 2013 right after the [Nicira acquisition](https://www.vmware.com/company/acquisitions/nicira.html) (company was around 13,000 at the time). He had been at EMC, which was at around 50,000 people. \n\n* You could feel the difference in company policies.  It wasn't highly stratified and even less so in the Nicira group Scott joined.  Martin Cassado called it the pirate ship (the networking and security business unit). \n\n* Scott could speak at marketing events, speak to engineers and product management about the product direction (NSX), and huddling with the CTO team on structure and roadmap of the product. \n\n* This was a lot of fun for Scott, and he got to work with a dynamic group of individuals. \n\n* When Scott left VMware in 2018, it was for small company called [Heptio](https://www.vmware.com/company/acquisitions/heptio.html) that had around 50 employees at the time. \n\n* The field engineering team did pre-sales, professional services, marketing events, product development, etc.  One of Scott's teammates built a tool for customers that turned into a popular open source project. \n\n* They wrote code, built features, and it was super dynamic. \n\n* This is one of the things Scott likes about working at Kong.  They are at over 300 employees now. \n\n* It might be building out a reference architecture, building an infrastructure as code lab, or something else entirely.  \n\n* For Scott the dynamic nature is a great fit, but it might not be a fit for everyone.  For others, a larger company with more well-defined roles may be attractive, and that's ok. \n\n## 35:07 - The Full Stack Career Journey and Closing Thoughts \n\n* Be sure to subscribe to Scott's podcast [Full Stack Journey](https://packetpushers.net/series/full-stack-journey/). \n\n* Nick was on [Episode 58 of Full Stack Journey](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/full-stack-journey-058-new-challenges-and-embracing-change/) to talk about lessons learned running Nerd Journey while John needed to step away. \n\n* Scott shares some advice he previously shared on [an episode of The Geek Whisperers](http://geek-whisperers.com/2015/10/facing-the-fear-of-failure-with-scott-lowe-ep-99/) many years ago. \n\n* Amy Lewis asked Scott to share 1 lesson he wishes he had learned earlier.  Scott believes his answer was don't underestimate the power of your community. \n\n* This is something many of us may be struggling with as a result of the pandemic.  We've come to rely on working in disconnected fashions. \n\n* We all have personal or professional communities that we can tap into which will help us succeed.  This is a lesson Scott feels like he did not learn early enough in his career. \n\n* At times he didn't want to ask for help.  The reality is there are a number of great people out there who would be willing to help you succeed if they are able.   \n\n* Don’t underestimate that or let yourself grow too cynical. \n\n* The collaboration between you and someone else allows you to do better than you could have done on your own. \n\n* If you want to follow Scott, reach out to him on Twitter [@Scott_Lowe](https://twitter.com/scott_lowe).  His DMs are open. \n\n* Scott blogs at [blog.scottlowe.org](blog.scottlowe.org) \n\n* He's active in the Kubernetes, CNCF, and other cloud native Slack communities. \n\n* Scott's podcast, [Full Stack Journey](https://packetpushers.net/series/full-stack-journey/), talks about the full stack of technologies available in today's datacenters.   \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-154":{"title":"Episode 154","content":"\n# Episode 154\n\nWelcome to episode 154 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Tom Hatch, the creator of Salt and founder of SaltStack.  Tom will share how he got into the industry through a love for public speaking, tips for interviewees and interviewers, and share the difficult challenges along the way.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 11-12-2021 \n\nTopics – Meet [[Tom Hatch]], A Love for #PublicSpeaking, #Interviews and Finding the Passionate Few, Learning to Interview Other People, The #IntelligenceCommunity, Stepping into #Automation (The Birth of #Salt), Working Yourself to Death, Difficult Changes \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:50 - Meet Tom Hatch \n\n* [Tom Hatch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thhatch/) is the original creator of [Salt](https://saltproject.io/), eventually founding a company called [SaltStack](https://www.vmware.com/company/acquisitions/saltstack.html).  #SaltStack #VMware\n\n* With SaltStack being acquired by VMware in late 2020, Tom works as a Senior Staff Engineer, moving things forward with the SaltStack group. \n\n* Tom's background is entrepreneurship, business management, and software development. \n\n* Tom wasn't raised a nerd and did not really get into technology until he was in his late teens, building computers.  He learned to write software in his mid 20s as part of a career shift. \n\n* Tom had started down a business management path.  After his first startup failed, he realized how much he liked working with computers. \n\n* He spent a lot of time learning about software and learning how Linux worked to better understand how computers worked.  \n\n* Back in 2007 Tom got a job at Red Hat as an instructor (first real tech job out of college).  The company flew him all over the place. \n\n* Tom was teaching classes on Red Hat Linux and administering the Red Hat Certified Engineer exam.  It was a lot of fun. \n\n* Tom ended up dropping out and not finishing his bachelor's degree.  He heard about a local company that did Red Hat training and sent the company his resume out of the blue to see what happened. \n\n* Tom was surprised when the company called him in for an interview.  He was asked to teach people how Linux permissions worked, and that was the interview.   \n\n* At the end of the interview the guy who owned the company said Tom's technical skills needed some work but that he could talk, which was really hard to find.  They were going to send Tom to a class, and if he passed the test over it he would be hired as an instructor. \n\n* Tom was thrilled, wanting to get a good job.  He was sent to a Red Hat Certified Engineer class.   \n\n* Previous to this, Tom had not been a Systems Administrator but just tinkered now and then.   \n\n* After studying his brains out, he passed the test.  Tom didn't realize at the time that very few people pass the test on their first try. \n\n* As promised, the company hired Tom. \n\n* His first assignment was to teach a class in St. Louis.  At the time he was pretty scared.  The night before the class started he wasn't sure he would be able to talk for a full week on the topics. \n\n* Once he started teaching, it was magic.  He kept talking the whole week. \n\n* Tom said this was one of those life moments where he realized there was something he was really passionate about and something he was good at doing. \n\n* At the end of the class, someone put into the review that it was refreshing to have someone with a PhD in the subject (which Tom didn't have and never said he did). \n\n* He left that week feeling like \"I can do this.\"  It was a transformative experience from just a guy wanting a good job to break into tech.  All of a sudden Tom had a certification, was getting great reviews, and was becoming someone who can administer the exam.  The level of transformation was mind boggling. \n\n## 9:26 - A Love for Public Speaking \n\n* Tom has always loved public speaking, even when he was a teenager, and any opportunity to give presentations is something he would seize.   \n\n* Tom started a company right after getting married in his early 20s doing media duplication which went under.  \n\n* Once he sold everything, he relocated the family and went to Southern Utah University because they let him in. \n\n* Tom started taking a class, and the professor stopped showing up.  The first time this happened, Thom thought nothing of it.  When it happened again, Tom told everyone he would teach the lesson because he had read ahead. \n\n* The professor only showed up for roughly 1/3 of his classes that term, and Tom taught the remainder of them.  He was written in as best Computer Science Professor that semester. \n\n* Does this mean Tom is \"broken that way\" or that he has a superpower?  Nick feels it is the latter. \n\n* The trick to learning things quickly is to not worry too much about learning them quickly. \n\n* Tom likes to wander around a subject and dive in deep. \n\n* One of the things they would do at SaltStack is hire people with a passion for the subject matter. \n\n* If you have a passion for the subject, if it means a lot to you, it will be something you will dig into deep. \n\n## 12:47 - Interviews and Finding the Passionate Few \n\n* The interview process followed at SaltStack helped find passionate people. \n\n* This would start with surface level questions.  Depending on how well the person answered, the interviewer would dig deeper until a candidate ran out of steam. \n\n* You can tell someone is passionate because they independently went deep.  The passion matters a lot more than just learning quickly. \n\n* The passion is something internal and that drives a person emotional.  You develop a depth of understanding about the foundations of the technology you're working with, which is exciting to Tom. \n\n* What kind of answer to a question you don't know the answer to communicates you have the passion and desire to go find out? \n\n* It's about how much they take personal ownership for their answers. \n\n* \"I don't know is one of my favorite things to hear in an interview.\" - Tom Hatch \n\n* Every now and then you interview someone who refuses to say they don't know (which acknowledges shortcomings).  You don't want to hire them. \n\n* Tom wants to hear where someone's knowledge ends but even more than that wants to know that someone will take personal ownership and accountability for who they are.  This means they will be an upright person who can be relied upon. \n\n* You can't count on someone who can't own their own self and where they are in life. \n\n* Nick recently saw a Reddit thread where someone admitted to lying about their skillset in interviews and ended up getting the job who was not sure what to do. \n\n* Tom says you can do a lot with confidence in the interview process. \n\n* He has interviewed a number of people who have been at the VP level who were really good at the interview but didn't actually know what they were doing.  It was their confidence that got them previous roles. \n\n* In situations like this Tom likes to ask more questions.  He's called up former employers of the super confident that advised against hiring these folks. \n\n* Watch out for overconfidence, and be willing to call people out when they don't know how something works.  A sniff test may be in order.  \n\n* This isn't about being rude to the person but finding out what they do and do not know. \n\n* It's so much harder to get rid of someone if you have made a hiring mistake than it is to hire a new employee. \n\n* Even though a job requirement may say a certain certification is needed, do not let it keep you from applying. \n\n* You're selling yourself short by not giving it a try.  You apply anyway, and if they don't call you back, ok.  Don't worry about it. \n\n* So many of us are afraid to step up to a challenge put in front of us, and we're afraid of being rejected. \n\n* Being rejected is one of the most beautiful things in the world.  Tom loves being rejected because there really is a silver lining to it.  You learn something and may have dodged a bullet. \n\n* Most people step back when told no and think \"I'm not good enough.\"  But it doesn't mean that.  It means the puzzle piece didn't fit.  Go find some other part of the puzzle. \n\n## 21:18 - Learning to Interview Other People \n\n* In 2008 Tom was laid off from his job as an instructor.  He worked for a company called Applied Signal Technology, a US Intelligence community contractor (to 3-letter government entities) that was later acquired by Raytheon. \n\n* During this time Tom worked with some of the most brilliant engineers.  The way they interviewed allowed Tom to begin to understand how to do it. \n\n* These folks would bring a candidate in and put them through a series of panel interviews to grill the candidate.  But it was always done in a respectful way. \n\n* They were looking for technical competency, but there were still some shortcomings in the way these people interviewed. \n\n* Most of the engineers Tom worked with were fresh out of college, and they would ask a lot of introductory questions. \n\n* It's important to look for a mixture of knowledge and wisdom in a candidate, but the engineers Tom mentioned were extremely knowledge focused.  \n\n* At SaltStack Tom started using this model but augmented it, trying to add elements to find passion, experience, and pivoting from technical questions to understanding how someone is going to navigate a difficult task. \n\n* What you get from this is some insight into how the person will function inside a specific organization or team. \n\n* A number of times Tom has passed over someone with more technical knowledge and experience only to land on someone with less because he was able to determine that was the person he needed the most instead of the one who impressed him the most.   \n\n* There's a difference between an interviewer being aggressive compared to disrespectful.   \n\n* Also remember you're interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you.  This is tech.  If you don't want to work with that person, don't.  There are jobs out there. \n\n## 25:54 - The Intelligence Community \n\n* Working for the intelligence community was a great job. \n\n* The initial interview was targeted toward technical capabilities, but after that an office manager shared with Tom that the role required a top secret security clearance and what that would entail, stating if any of that was a problem he would not be able to keep the job. \n\n* It took almost 5 months to complete the security clearance and 2 weeks spent filling out all the paperwork before that. \n\n* In the end, it was incredibly thorough. \n\n* The checks are often looking for liabilities that could be exploited.  \n\n* Those who have betrayed the intelligence community often times have had money problems and drug addictions (many other issues stem from these).  \n\n* Nick has heard this kind of clearance opens a lot of doors for people. \n\n* The work Tom did as part of having that clearance was intense but also deeply satisfying. \n\n* Tom was writing software to automate different things.  He was on a team of brilliant people. \n\n* They were helping with top level terrorist situations happening at the time, and it was exciting and inciteful.  Though he could not discuss any of the details even with his family, he felt honored to work on that kind of stuff. \n\n## 30:04 - Stepping into Automation (The Birth of Salt) \n\n* Tom was working on systems automation in the early days of DevOps. \n\n* After leaving the intelligence community, he worked for a small startup called Beyond Oblivion.  At the end of 2011, they failed as a company. \n\n* Tom was working there as the Infrastructure Architect and used Puppet to automate all of the Linux systems. \n\n* In February 2010, Tom had a brain tumor removed.  The left side of his tongue is paralyzed as a result, and the left side of his brain stem has been compressed. \n\n* His left vocal cord is paralyzed. \n\n* He could not talk for about 2 years as a result of this and could barely whisper. \n\n* Tom had been playing around with fan out command and control since college, and he had iterated on it a few times. \n\n* He got approval from the company to make an open source project which contained a fan out technology that was crazy fast. \n\n* Someone at work mentioned to Tom he could do a better job than Puppet.  Tom said no, feeling he would have to write a programming language for this and would also have to grow a beard (listen to the story about why a beard seemed fitting). \n\n* He figured out a way to do this without authoring a programming language, adding this into [Salt](https://saltproject.io/) for declarative idempotent systems management. \n\n* The office director came to Tom and stated everyone hates Puppet.  This person knew Tom was working on something that might be better.  When Tom said it was something he was working on for fun, the person said, \"it's not for fun anymore.  Make it work.\" \n\n* The next 1.5 months was spent making it work to properly automate systems. \n\n* That drive is what got Tom over the line to get Salt to function. \n\n* There's a lot to be said about having a real user to drive development. \n\n* There is nothing like the pressure of having to make something work. \n\n## 34:42 - Working Yourself to Death \n\n* This point Tom was getting up, going to work, coming home, spending time with family for a little while, and working on Salt until the wee hours of the morning…repeating this routine day after day from late 2011 until sometime in 2014 when Tom ended up in the hospital with heart problems. \n\n* He had to dial things back a little as a result. \n\n* Nick references the interview with Keiran Shelden on [You, Your Health, and the Datacenter](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-047-you-your-health-and-the-datacenter-with-keiran-shelden-pt-2/). \n\n* In the tech industry, we don't always keep health at the forefront. \n\n* It is an insane amount of work maintaining an open source project, but the reality is you can take care of yourself and work really hard. \n\n* Finding that balance is really important.  Balance is hard, and that's just life. \n\n* A good life is a balanced life. \n\n* If you're not trying to find balance, you're not owning your own shortcomings, you're not being honest about the problems in front of you, you're not finding balance. \n\n* It's worth it to dial things back and constantly evaluate. \n\n* Ask yourself… \n\n* What's really going on out there? \n\n* How does this stuff really work? \n\n* What is really happening in the world isn't what is in the news.  It's not what is in the conspiracy theories. \n\n* It's a bunch of human nature.  People are crazy and do silly things. \n\n* This world is complicated.  Let it be complicated, and try to live a happy life. \n\n## 38:16 - Difficult Changes \n\n* It was hard for Tom to make changes, and he doesn't feel like he did it as well as he believes he should have.   \n\n* He was the CTO of SaltStack at the time, and there wopas a great deal of growth involved in being a CTO. \n\n* Tom made a lot of mistakes along the way.  Deep down he just wanted to be an engineer. \n\n* It was incredibly scary and intimidating to have to fire someone, to figure out how to make payroll, and to go into a board meeting and start yelling at people. \n\n* He didn't have the fortitude to do what he felt should have been done, which is a big regret. \n\n* Tom realized he was hiding from a lot of the aspects of running a business by focusing so much on the code. \n\n* Tom had to step out of the code and learn monetization strategies, for example.  It was switching gears, realizing it was not just dialing back on the amount but that there were new things he needed to learn.  He needed to stop chasing the comfortable path and start chasing the discomfort. \n\n* Tom had to understand how to get things accomplished without him being the driving force behind it or the only one doing it.  He needed to understand what drives sales and monetization of software and where automation fit. \n\n* Preventing working yourself to death is not just about dialing back the hours.  If you're working yourself to death, there is something else driving it. \n\n* Are you desperate to get out of a situation? \n\n* Is it because you feel a weight of responsibility you shouldn't feel? \n\n* Is it because you're passionate about the wrong things? \n\n* It's more about trying to find the root problem. \n\n* When Tom got out of the hospital, he knew he had to fix things.  But he didn't know what the core thing was he needed to fix. \n\n* He didn't get it fixed for another 5 years. \n\n* The core thing was not code, which is where his obsession was.  It was the problems in his own personal life he needed to clean up (how he viewed himself, responsibilities to his family, difficult personal situations, etc.). \n\n* Tom was working himself to death to escape from other personal problems he didn't have the guts to look at. \n\n* Nick compares this to root cause analysis for the full human, perhaps the hard work we do not always want to do. \n\n* It requires looking at yourself with brutal honesty and recognizing what needs cleanup.  But at the same time, you can't beat yourself up too much. \n\n* Recognize you may have to do hard things to resolve the problems.  Only then will you be able to find your path and find the inner peace that allows you to sleep at night. \n\n* That stuff is what's really hard, but often times if you're being driven to an unhealthy place, there's something unhealthy driving you there. \n\n* For further reading based on the intro and outro of this episode, check out: \n\n* [Episode 42](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-042-ethan-banks-and-the-journey-to-career-self-awareness/) and [Episode 43](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-043-ethan-banks-on-podcasting-and-turning-a-hobby-into-the-packet-pushers/) with Ethan Banks and John's reference to the [Dunning Krueger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-155":{"title":"Episode 155","content":"\n# Episode 155\n\nWelcome to episode 155 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Tom Hatch, digging deeper into what it was like to maintain an open source project and its ecosystem, learn about life as an entrepreneur, and what it was like to have his company acquired.  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 11-12-2021 \n\n[Tom Hatch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thhatch/) is the original creator of [Salt](https://saltproject.io/), eventually founding a company called [SaltStack](https://www.vmware.com/company/acquisitions/saltstack.html), which was acquired by VMware in 2020.  Catch part 1 of our interview with Tom in [Episode 154](https://nerd-journey.com/find-a-balanced-life-with-tom-hatch-1-2) [[Tom Hatch]] [[Episode 154]] #Salt #SaltStack #VMware\n\nTopics – Learning the #OpenSourceCommunity, Open Source Contributions as Career Accelerators, Two and Three Dimensional Thinking, Advice for the #Entrepreneur, Getting #Acquired \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:08 - Learning the Open Source Community \n\n* When Salt began it was just Tom.  He had the most commits to the project until around 2019 but had almost completely stopped working on it in 2015. \n\n* Tom built the vast majority of the core features in Salt from scratch (architected and built).  The contributions from others have been astonishing. \n\n* For a long time it was just Tom running the show. But he had the opportunity to work with some amazing engineers at SaltStack who did amazing things. \n\n* The open source community was new to Tom, and he had not worked on other projects before Salt. \n\n* Through 2011, there were not a lot of contributions to the project despite people starting to use it. \n\n* Salt began in February 2011.  Tom did a podcast in November 2011 and received only 11 contributions from other people to that point. \n\n* By the end of 2011 the project had contributions from over 110 people.  A little bit of marketing and exposure created the spike. \n\n* Suddenly Tom was reviewing code and trying to figure out how to communicate with the contributors. \n\n* Was it a challenge to protect the goals for the project while still being collaborative and respectful to contributors? \n\n* Tom had some self-confidence issues at first.  He saw himself as a guy cranking out code, not believing he knew that much. As a result, he may have accepted more advice than he should have from community contributors. \n\n* Tom advises that in all of this (i.e. working we collaborators in this way), we should be diplomatic and understand what changing one portion of the code might break. \n\n* You can very quickly become a slave to the community.  Many open source leaders have talked about this.  There are so many voices wanting you to do certain things you get scared to say no. \n\n* Even if you are saying no, you spend your days looking through [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).  Tom remembers days when there were over 100 pull requests.   \n\n* While the code contributions were helpful, he wanted to spend more time driving the project forward. \n\n* Much of this experience shaped his view of what he feels open source should be.  In the early days open source followed the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).  For example, think about how Apache got started.  Open source is built in a distributed way. \n\n* In the last 10-15 years, there has been venture capital and corporate investment into open source.  We've started to develop open source through a corporate lens because of the size and scope of projects out there.   \n\n* Take [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for example. \n\n* Tom's view is that we need to re-think how we write highly distributed software. \n\n* One of the projects he is working on inside VMware is called [Idem](https://octo.vmware.com/idem-multi-cloud-management-automation/).   \n\n* This is based on POP (plugin oriented programming), a construct within Salt. \n\n* The idea behind the project is that we need to free up engineers to innovate and keep building without getting bogged down in community governance or politics as projects get larger. \n\n* With POP, it's about how code can be merged outside the dependency library model.  There are still some downstream dependencies with POP, but it allows people to attach to and extend your software without needing to talk to you.  Someone can take the plugin interfaces that you create, write their own code to merge into your software, and get the full benefit of their work. \n\n* This allows the person who wrote the software to own it instead of it becoming part of someone else's project. \n\n* Contributors will come and go.  Accepting contributions also accepts a certain liability. \n\n* From a POP perspective, Tom is trying to allow contributions to his software but have other people maintain the code.  He can mainstream it into his software after it has established itself on its own merit. \n\n* This is similar to how Unix worked a long time ago. \n\n* We're writing open source software inside of a cathedral now instead of a bazaar, and we're making the people creating the software slaves to their own community. \n\n* Tom has seen a lot of friends go nuts maintaining open source projects. \n\n* Nick's experience with open source contributions is limited to his work on [Mangle](https://vmware.github.io/mangle/) documentation. \n\n## 13:47 - Open Source Contributions as Career Accelerators \n\n* Tom shares a story of a job interview.  The interviewer asked him how to do something specific.  Tom referenced how it could be done with a specific module and then shared he had written it himself. \n\n* One of the interviewers realized they were already using Tom's code and shared that with the hiring manager.  Tom had an offer in his Inbox before he arrived at home, which was 30% more than what he was making at the time. \n\n* You can definitely make career improvements by contributing to open source, but a lot of people are contributing to open source. \n\n* What you get by contributing today has more to do with your exposure to getting a good code review, learning how the process works, and getting your hands dirty with code. \n\n* Ten years ago if you committed to open source projects it would make you stand out. \n\n* But these days it's less of a wow factor than it used to be. \n\n* If Tom can see someone has contributed to a lot of projects and can then go look at the person's contributions to determine competence. \n\n* In the same light, someone can look at your activity on GitHub (including conversations) and see indications of your character.   \n\n* When you contribute to open source, remember that you are there to learn and grow.  You're not there to be smarter than everyone else or boss everyone around. \n\n* Be careful what you post in publicly available forums because it is a digital trail for your personal brand. \n\n* Tom has spent time doing acting during his career.  There's a video of Michael Caine giving an acting class in the 90s in which he says \"establish a personal brand.\"   \n\n* Movies and TV shows look for a specific personality to fill the role.  If you have a really good brand, those making decisions will think of you for the role. \n\n* When you write open source software, you are establishing a person brand that communicates you are a certain type of expert and that you approach problems in a specific way. \n\n* The brand you create is something that will carry you forward in your career. \n\n* Hiring managers aren't looking for just another run of the mill engineer.  They know there are a specific set of problems to solve and need people who understand the problems and can function inside the roles. \n\n* You want to be hired by companies that are looking for a brand and not just a pile of engineers. You want a company that recognizes the brand you're able to create.  \n\n* But don't let your ego get in the way. \n\n* Tom loves working for people who know things he doesn't know.  He loves working with people who want to learn, and he loves working with people who make good friends. \n\n* Our intelligences are spheres of things we know.  Tom understands he has a lot to learn and is deeply interested in others' knowledge outside of his scope.  Intelligence is coming together in a collaborative way, understanding we are here to stand together and lift. \n\n## 22:29 - Two and Three Dimensional Thinking \n\n* Tom did a session at VMworld 2021 called The SaltStack Story.  You can watch the replay [here](https://www.vmware.com/vmworld/en/video-library/video-landing.html?sessionid=1620924360522001Kyso).   \n\n* It requires you create a free Customer Connect id if you do not already have one. \n\n* Tom did a talk at [SaltConf 2021](https://saltconf.com/) about open source in the enterprise, and it encompassed 2 and 3-dimensional thinking. \n\n* We need to account for a very big ecosystem. \n\n* Take Tom's example of [Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan). \n\n* Someone thinking 2-dimensionally has the blinders on and is hyperfocused on things directly in front of them. \n\n* To think 3-dimensionally is to look at things more broadly and build things that function inside of a broader ecosystem.  We need to think 3-dimensionally about open source software because they are critical to driving software adoption in the modern world. \n\n* If you're creating proprietary software and not seeking an understanding of how open source software is driving people to your proprietary software, you may be missing the boat. \n\n* Consider overall strategic objectives of your software solution and the components of that objective which need to draw people to the solution in an open source way as well as in a proprietary way.   \n\n* You must understand the nature of open source development vs. proprietary development. \n\n* Tom makes an interesting point about the year of the open source desktop. \n\n* The overall product strategy must take into account multiple veins and aspects of users.  It's not just a user problem.  It's an ecosystem problem.  \n\n* We need to build software that builds communities and ecosystems.  This is 3-dimensional thinking. \n\n* Who do I need to address with open source software? \n\n* What communities do I need to interact with? \n\n* What do I need to build on top of? \n\n* What are the strengths and weaknesses I get from utilizing this open source software? \n\n* Who are target customers driving this development toward? \n\n* How do I compensate for the liabilities I inherit from using open source? \n\n* The companies doing this well are the trillion dollar companies.  That is the huge shift Microsoft made.  They embraced open source, drive developer adoption, understood working in a larger ecosystem, and were ultimately able to accelerate their own solution architecture development by adopting open source.  They created trust in markets where it did not exist before. \n\n* Apple may not say it, but they use tons of open source software inside MacOS.  They did it with an understanding of the liabilities they inherited. \n\n* Nick thinks of participation in communities outside of your day job as analogous to the freemium version of a software package that drives you toward the paid version (a new job) - which is 3-dimensional thinking. \n\n* Your contributions make a brand that establishes you as part of a ecosystem which drives your career forward in a highly productive way. \n\n* Going to work and doing only what you're told to do is 2-dimensional thinking. \n\n## 31:31 - Advice for the Entrepreneur \n\n* If Tom could go back and give himself advice, he wouldn't say anything.  He needed to be on the path he was on and is grateful for the struggle. \n\n* This has given Tom more than any monetary success ever could have. \n\n* He is at peace with his struggles and his mistakes. \n\n* One of the most important parts of being human is understanding the struggles you have can be some of the most beautiful things in life. \n\n* Tom runs into a lot of people who are / want to be entrepreneurs.   \n\n* He routinely provides advice to these folks, encouraging them to call him in a month.  They almost never call him back, and none of them got anywhere. \n\n* You need tenacity and to accept the fact that others may think what you are doing is nuts.  It also might actually be nuts. \n\n* Tom is working on a few things right now where he feels like he's nuts / has people tell him he's nuts. \n\n* Roll with the punches and walk through situations.  Accept that things will not go the way you want all the time, and be willing to learn and grow. \n\n* Always be willing to look at things from a different angle.   \n\n* Where you think you're going isn't where you're going to be.  Stop thinking it is.   \n\n* Have goals, a vision, and a plan.  Drive toward them.  Accept that waves will push you in different directions.   \n\n* When you go in a different direction, accept it, and understand where you are.  Look around.  Realize you know more about the lay of the land.  How will it change your thinking?  * What new opportunities are out there now? \n\n* While you build, don’t close doors. \n\n* We write software that makes it hard / blocks us in.  Take 30 more minutes and consider not closing that door. \n\n* If you leave those doors open, you'll have more opportunities, and you will be able to see the big picture.  That's what you have to do as an entrepreneur. \n\n* Listen to Tom's observations of entrepreneurs who missed the big picture but had a win with their first venture. \n\n* If you want to be a good entrepreneur, don't bet on luck. \n\n* Every time something goes wrong, there is some good in it.  You have to find it and figure it out…because that is where the real opportunities are. \n\n## 37:50 - Getting Acquired \n\n* Tom explains to his daughters that his job as a dad is to do everything he can to raise them so they can be self-sufficient humans with self-confidence. \n\n* Nothing will make him happier than for them to have their own lives. \n\n* With SaltStack getting acquired, Tom's baby has gone off to college.  It is able to run itself to a large degree. \n\n* Tom is still doing a ton of work around SaltStack these days, but he doesn't have to be as hands on with day-to-day functionalities. \n\n* His goal, like a good parent, is for the project to not need him and be self-sufficient. \n\n* This opens up opportunities within VMware for Tom to \"have more kids.\"  He's able to work on things like POP and Idem as mentioned earlier that enrich the Salt ecosystem. \n\n* Tom is not a big social media guy, but you can [find him on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thhatch/) or as thatch45 on most social media platforms. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-156":{"title":"Episode 156","content":"\n# Episode 156\n\nWelcome to episode 156 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 1 of an interview with Josh Duffney (a return guest) to discuss his adoption of the smart notes methodology, how it helped in both work and personal projects, how Josh reads intentionally, and Josh's new book on smart notes.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 12-14-2021 \n\nTopics – [[Josh Duffney]] Returns, Motivation for Adopting a New Approach, [[Smart Notes]] Basics, A Critical Eye for Relevance, Changing Directions, Intentional Reading, [[How to Take Smart Notes in Obsidian ]] #Obsidian\n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:56 - Josh Duffney Returns! \n\n* [Josh Duffney](https://duffney.io/) is a Senior Content Developer for Microsoft and has just hit his 1 year anniversary in that role as of January 4, 2022.  You can also find him on [GitHub](https://github.com/Duffney).  #Microsoft #GitHub\n\n* Josh Duffney was with us in 2 previous episodes: \n\n* [Episode 123](https://nerd-journey.com/just-add-value-with-josh-duffney-1-2/) - Just Add Value with Josh Duffney (1/2) \n\n* [Episode 124](https://nerd-journey.com/focus-create-and-iterate-with-josh-duffney-2-2/) - Focus, Create, and Iterate with Josh Duffney (2/2) \n\n* Can you name the only other repeat guest on Nerd Journey? \n\n* Josh has written a new book, but he wrote it on his way to write a different book. \n\n* His book is called [How to Take Smart Notes in Obsidian](https://joshduffney.gumroad.com/l/take-smart-notes-obsidian/NerdJourney).  That is a special link for Nerd Journey listeners to get an additional discount on the book. \n\n## 5:12 - Motivation for Adopting a New Approach \n\n* Josh was drowning in information.  He wanted to write his first nonfiction book after writing [his first technical book](https://joshduffney.gumroad.com/l/become-ansible). \n\n* He has done a lot of work on productivity, [[digital minimalism]], and wellbeing and wanted that to crystalize into a book. \n\n* Unfortunately Josh bit off more than he could chew at the beginning. \n\n* Josh has spent the last year trying to learn how to write the caliber of book he wants to write.  This required a lot of information, and Josh could not keep it all in his head.  He stumbled upon smart notes to help develop an external system that would help. \n\n* There are many schools of thought on productivity such as [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) and others. \n\n* Josh heard about the smart notes system through repeated word of mouth.  He tends to be a late adopter, letting others filter out the noise. \n\n* A few years ago his manager mentioned Josh's interest in productivity and suggested he read the book [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes-Audiobook/B09HSSQMTW?source_code=GPAGBSH0508140001\u0026ipRedirectOverride=true). \n\n* This kept resurfacing on Twitter by others, eventually getting promoted by someone whose newsletter Josh followed. At that point Josh decided to give it a shot. \n\n* After reading the book, he felt it was exactly what he needed. \n\n* It gave Josh a way to reverse engineer the process of writing. \n\n* As a content developer, Josh writes all the time in his day job. \n\n* The fear of the blank page has always bothered Josh.  He has spent the last year learning how to write fast and how to de-compartmentalize phases of writing. \n\n* Right after reading comes note taking.  If you have a pile of notes and a way to go back and find them, you always have an idea to write about.   \n\n* This also allows a way to organize thoughts that were swirling in Josh's head and causing anxiety. \n\n* Once you read a certain scale, you need somewhere to externalize the knowledge to reference at a later time.  There is no way to keep so many mental models in your head. \n\n* The book [[How to Take Smart Notes]] is really the American publisher's title.  It was originally titled [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), and the original translation of that is slip box (somewhat akin to a 1980s card catalog at a library).  Originally the system was a pile of cards with index numbers on them and ideas.   [[Zettelkasten]]\n\n* How to think and write more productively is kind of the point of the book. \n\n* True Zettelkasten practitioners will make the same distinction on smart notes. \n\n* Josh says it is easy to get hung up on smart notes and the permanent note.  It puts so much pressure on the permanent note, but really note taking should improve with iteration over time as you learn to take over time. \n\n* There's no specific format of a smart note.  It's more about using them to think better and organize your knowledge. \n\n## 11:37 - Smart Notes Basics \n\n* The basic notion is that there are several notes, each with a different purpose. \n\n* Fleeting notes - sort of like a journal or short / brief notes to capture an idea, task, or insight \n\n* Josh keeps a notebook with him at all times and uses it for fleeting notes. \n\n* These are meant to be processed within a couple of days and might generate things like reminders. \n\n* Literature notes - taking notes while you read and turning reading from a passive activity into an active activity. \n\n* This was the one Josh was least familiar with.  The primary purpose of this kind of note is to get more familiar with and understand the literature itself. \n\n* The inventor of Zettelkasten would take notes on index cards as he read.  Think of it like a brief summary with a page number on the index card to go back and reference / take in depth notes later. \n\n* Check out [How to Read a Book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095), which provides a framework for marking up books (underline, write in margins, etc.). \n\n* [SQ3R](https://ucc.vt.edu/academic_support/study_skills_information/sq3r_reading-study_system.html) is a another reading comprehension method referenced as is [SQ5R](https://www.etown.edu/offices/learning/SQ5R_Method.aspx).  The number of Rs depends on how much review you do. \n\n* Josh uses literature notes heavily when reading technical books, most recently in his learning of the [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/). \n\n* Permanent notes - notes you want to keep forever but malleable in the sense that you can rework them \n\n* These are the types of notes that go into your Zettelkasten / slip box.  In [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), this would be called a vault (where your knowledge base is built). \n\n* There is an entire process around connecting the notes. \n\n* John found the goal of extracting knowledge as you ingest it and predigesting it into the knowledge base as extremely interesting. \n\n* You can see all the things of interest in one place and understand these are the things you should write about. \n\n* Josh says the promise is once you have built the knowledge base you can look into it for ideas and that the majority of the work will have been done for you as you get ready to write a blog post or book. \n\n* Listen to John's example of how putting a few permanent notes together to form a blog post might work. \n\n* Josh says you will find the truth that there is no writing.  There is only rewriting.  As you take the notes and bring into different texts they will need transitions, some will need more clarity, and you'll find you can move around. \n\n* Once you get the knowledge out of your head you can externalize and move it around in a way you just can't do when it's in your head. \n\n* Josh's preference - whatever medium you have consumed the information in should be the medium you use to make notes.  For example, if Josh read a physical book, he would use physical note cards to start and transfer to Obsidian later. \n\n* Usually this is reserved for difficult books (200-300 page books get marked up and translated to physical notes). \n\n* For going through a tutorial or a blog post, Josh would put literature notes directly into Obsidian as he went.  The literature note would then get converted later into a permanent note.   \n\n* Listen to Josh's example about doing this for the knowledge base he is building for Go lang. \n\n* Do you copy things down word for word as you come across them (literature notes) or put into your own words? \n\n* It is advised if you want to understand the material better that you put it into your own words. \n\n* Josh uses quote blocks in Obsidian if he's taking something word for word.  But the note likely would include more than just the quote to further his understanding. \n\n## 20:42 - A Critical Eye for Relevance \n\n* Relevance has been the number 1 skill sharpened from note taking.  Since we last spoke, Josh has taken 370 physical notes  and over 400 digital notes. \n\n* He's getting a lot better in the process of what is relevant.  At first he was reluctant to rely on his brain for remembering anything. \n\n* Josh recently re-read [The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains](https://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393339750) by Nicholas Carr.  Our minds can always expand. \n\n* When Josh first began, he was treating himself like a computer (read / write operations, needing to consume everything into a note).  His ability to determine what is relevant and important has improved over time as has ability to trust in his own intellect.   \n\n* Just like any skill, this became easier to do over time. \n\n* You start to develop a critical eye for what's worth keeping and what is not worth keeping. \n\n* For example, when Josh was learning Go programming the definition of a Go package and the Go init command seemed really important, but with repetition they turned out to be fundamental concepts.  It would have made a good literature note but not a good permanent note unless Josh wanted to teach someone Go fundamentals.  Over time you develop the critical pieces that need capturing instead of everything. \n\n* You also get better at paraphrasing and summarizing other peoples' work to make your own note. \n\n* While the logical side of smart notes can make sense to people, what is it that triggers the emotional side? \n\n* Josh mentioned the smart notes approach is a great way to hedge against information overload. \n\n* One of the realizations you have as you start to take notes will be that you cannot consume everything and the rate at which you are consuming information right now is somewhat wasteful as it is going right through your head. \n\n* It forces you to slow down and take a more deliberate approach, helping you weed out the irrelevant information and better digest the information that is relevant for you. \n\n* It helps alleviate the anxiety of information overload by allowing you to better break down and digest the relevant information into something that is usable while improving your own understanding. \n\n* There's more benefit for the time you do put in and less anxiety by focusing on what's relevant to you. \n\n* John echoes the career benefits of this process and practice: \n\n* Quickly consuming technical information and pointing out what is different from what you already know. \n\n* Storing the information in such a way that it is retrievable when needed \n\n* Eventually generate some type of published work \n\n* \"Note taking is the deliberate practice of writing.\" - Josh Duffney \n\n* Every time you take a note you are practicing the effective communication of ideas. \n\n* Writing a blog post is no small thing.  It can have tremendous impact.  In Josh's case, the blog led to a self-published book that got him into the door at Microsoft. \n\n## 27:40 - Changing Directions \n\n* Josh was working on a book called Reclaim when he wrote and published his book on smart notes in Obsidian. \n\n* Josh says he spent months re-reading the original smart notes book and implementing several different iterations of the notes system. \n\n* There was a lot of sunk cost in implementation.  He kept re-designing and re-implementing the vault. \n\n* He also received good feedback from others that the smart notes topic was worthwhile. \n\n* With Josh's career shift from being an engineer to being a writer, he saw note taking as a critical foundation for this new role. \n\n* It seemed more beneficial to pause the writing of Reclaim in lieu of honing skills with smart notes.  \n\n* Josh is often single threaded while working on a project.  If he realizes he is missing a skillset he will pause and take time to learn the new skill. \n\n* For example, Josh is currently reading [The Craft of Research](https://www.amazon.com/Research-Chicago-Writing-Editing-Publishing/dp/022623973X) because he believes there is a gap in his non-fiction arguments. \n\n* He used writing to help him better understand the note taking philosophy / methodology. \n\n* John mentioned the idea of connected notes (i.e. notes as nodes on a graph) and the potential for these connections to lead to something publishable. \n\n* It took around 20 hours for Josh to write his first blog post (about 3000 words).   \n\n* He received a lot of questions and some criticisms of the article which spurred a rewrite. \n\n* Once he made it to 5000 or 6000 words Josh realized it was no longer a blog post but was more like a book. \n\n* Josh imported about 74 notes that were written on note cards (after reading the smart notes book for the 4th time) into digital form as part of the smart notes methodology, which allows the connections mentioned earlier to surface. \n\n## 31:42 - Intentional Reading \n\n* In a talk given at AmpNavigator 2021 (called \"The Learner's Rule\"), Josh mentioned part of his daily routine is spending time reading. \n\n* Right now Josh reads for about 1 hour per day. \n\n* Usually he will dedicate a 40 minute block in the morning to reading, but he tries to read as much as he can. \n\n* Josh does not own a smart phone (only a light phone).  A replacement for all the scrolling has been reading.   \n\n* When with his family or on the weekends, Josh carries his current book with him, making marks / notes as needed when time allows. \n\n* Normally Josh would read a little of his current book after lunch each day.  This has progressed into reading articles / blogs that he's pushed to Kindle. \n\n* The smart notes methodology encourages writing 3 permanent notes per day to practice, but Josh felt that was a lot of pressure. \n\n* Ryan Holiday and Robert Greene suggest a different approach. They mark up literature notes in the book, throw it on a bookshelf, and let it sit for a time. \n\n* Josh just finished reading [The Perennial Seller](https://www.amazon.com/Perennial-Seller-Making-Marketing-Lasts/dp/0143109014) by Ryan Holiday and plans to let it sit for a week before taking down some permanent notes from it for the first couple hours of one morning.  This may take several days, but Josh prefers batching in this way. \n\n* Josh keeps a Kanban board of all the books he is interested in reading. \n\n* Blog posts Josh reads get processed in real-time and equate to a few smart notes, but books get batched. \n\n* Josh likes to read 1 book at a time.  Sometimes he will jump back and forth, but usually it is one at a time and takes about 10 days for Josh to read a book. \n\n* This process reminds John of [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B0189PVAWY) by Cal Newport. \n\n* The act of carrying a physical book around is interesting to John.  Josh's process is sort of like the fusion of deep work with smart notes and reading. \n\n* We take a second to speak to audio book format (which Nick loves).  John mentions it is challenging to take notes on an audio book.  Josh says the audio format is great for skimming. \n\n* Josh used the audio book format for reading [Think Again](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Again-Power-Knowing-What/dp/B08HJQHNH9/) by Adam Grant. \n\n* Josh says it is super useful to use deep work to batch  note taking.  Good books produce 20-30 notes that Josh writes down on a notecard and then transfers into Obsidian.  The process works for him (since he is trying to write a book that crystalizes good advice), but he would not recommend it for everyone.  \n\n* For example, there is no such rigorous process in place for his Go Lang work. \n\n* Josh's notes are pretty short now but were very long when he began.   \n\n* He tries to focus on what can fit on a notecard because that is how much you can hold in your brain and works well when dumping into Obsidian. \n\n* Listen to how Josh determined the max number of words he could fit on a 4\" x 6\" index card (around 144). \n\n* John had trouble with notes being too long when he started using the smart notes methodology as well. \n\n* Josh references a post he wrote for his Knowledge Worker newsletter called [Note-taking became a full-time job, so I stopped](https://theknowledgeworker.substack.com/p/note-taking-became-a-full-time-job).  It surfaces a number of failures and learnings around the smart notes methodologies. \n\n* Be sure to grab a copy of Josh's book [How to Take Smart Notes in Obsidian](https://joshduffney.gumroad.com/l/take-smart-notes-obsidian/NerdJourney). \n\n* The link above is a special discount for Nerd Journey listeners, so take advantage! \n\n## 40:01 - How to Take Smart Notes in Obsidian \n\n* With Josh being a technical writer by trade, the focus of his book (in contrast to the [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes-Audiobook/B09HSSQMTW?source_code=GPAGBSH0508140001\u0026ipRedirectOverride=true) book) is implementation of the smart notes methodology with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). \n\n* The book is an implementation guide to adopting the smart notes methodology. \n\n* Obsidian is a knowledge management tool based on markdown that allows you to link notes together very much like web pages. \n\n* Obsidian is free for personal use but also has commercial offerings.  There is a mobile client you can utilize as well (which is relatively new). \n\n* Josh chooses not to use the mobile client because he has no smart phone.  He utilizes layers of friction like the physical act of writing in a notebook and transcribing digitally as ways to filter what gets stored as a digital note to ensure quality. \n\n* John makes the point that taking more notes isn't better.  Taking better notes is better.  It seems obvious only after someone shares that advice with you. \n\n* The goal isn't to record everything I ever know in a knowledge management system but to keep track of things I need to be reminded of an maybe reveal connections to other things I know. \n\n* Josh references [a video by Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE7a4IsDTEk) on the purpose of memory.  The purpose of memory is really to forget.  Keep that in mind as you take notes because you're not looking for a photographic memory. \n\n* Josh has two main drivers for his current notes: \n\n* One is the book he is working on, [Reclaim](https://joshduffney.gumroad.com/l/re-claim), and trying to crystalize arguments that form a narrative. \n\n* The other is for learning. \n\n* A couple of months after joining Microsoft the opportunity came up for Josh to switch from the DevOps space he had known well to go into GoLang (only loosely connected).  Josh would be writing documents for an unfamiliar discipline and get exposure to a new community.   \n\n* The purpose of smart notes for Josh's work is to help him learn faster. \n\n* Think about why you're taking the notes in the first place.  What is it you plan to do with them afterward? \n\n* It's important to keep the why in mind when you pursue something.  What is the goal? \n\n* Not everyone would consume information at the same rate as Josh does.  Perhaps we should let the goals we have (i.e. publish a blog post every so often) determine the rate of consuming other people's content and writing notes. \n\n* \"[[Writing is Thinking]].  Allow that to slow you down to understand what you are consuming much better.\" - Josh Duffney \n\n* See also [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/logseq/status/1471177051587686405). \n\n* Literature notes are a great way to experience this ([[Writing is Thinking]]).  Read a page, pause, and try to write a sentence about the page trying to summarize to see how many gaps you might have.  This allows you to see the gaps you may have about the argument but think more clearly about it at the same time. \n\n* Josh recently reorganized a vault he has in Obsidian with over 200 notes for his next book.  Rewriting the notes and rearranging them has helped him gain clarity. \n\n* Something so complex requires that you stand back from it enough (through writing it) to further your understanding. \n\n* It's easy to fool yourself when you're in your head.  Josh gives a great example realizing he didn't know enough about service principals to write a specific article on GoLang.  The writing helped identify the gaps Josh needed to fill by learning more. \n\n* [[Teaching is Understanding]].  And Don Jones told us in [Episode 137](https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/) that teaching is repackaging. [[Episode 137]]\n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-157":{"title":"Episode 157","content":"\n# Episode 157\n\nWelcome to episode 157 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

The Challenge of the Blank Page \n\n* Josh has some of his [[Smart Notes]] in a GitHub repository (a vault containing smart notes for one of his books). \n\n* He had a project note and started to link in relevant notes.  Josh would then build a workspace in Obsidian to open all the notes so he could read, review, and organize them.  Then he would start to write using [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  #Ulysses #VSCode\n\n* Smart notes make writing easier but not easy.  You need more than just a few words between notes.  Josh says many times what you need is the ideas to be strung together to write a clearer argument.  \n\n* When considering the challenge of the blank page, Nick thinks back to George Lucas trying to write the script to Star Wars on a tight deadline.   \n\n* There was a lot of impostor syndrome in the beginning, but Josh has the reverse problem right now - too many ideas to actually execute upon. \n\n* This is something that has happened to Nick and John with the podcast (so many ideas). \n\n* With Josh's current rough draft of [[Reclaim]], getting started can be a challenge.  It helps to have an introduction and conclusion note because you need something to frame the argument before you begin writing. \n\n* Josh has to fight editing / correcting while he is writing.  He's trying to remove this from the rough draft, and at present there's some friction in the rewriting process. \n\n## 10:04 - Impact on Josh's Current Book \n\n* The process of taking [[Smart Notes]] has helped Josh to understand the 175 pages he's already written are a bit incoherent. \n\n* Josh references a tip from [[The Craft of Research]] in which the author says taking notes faster than you can sort them can cause anxiety. \n\n* Josh had been feeling anxiety for a number of months regarding the book, and he knew he had already cut out technology usage (i.e. [[Digital Minimalism]]).  The process of smart notes has helped reduce Josh's anxiety. \n\n* In the beginning Josh was researching and writing but not sorting.  This process (smart notes) has given him the ability to sort in a way that reduces anxiety and keeps the structure there to allow completion of research and write when he is able. \n\n* Research is now a separate process from writing.  Josh is planning to do research for a month and then write for a couple of weeks to catch up.   \n\n* Josh has set many deadlines, and they have caused more harm than good for him. \n\n* [[Ryan Holiday]]'s advice to a prospective writer was \"you can only be a writer if you can't not be a writer.\" \n\n* For Josh the deadlines create a problem he cannot let go / an unnecessary urgency.  But they did help him get started. \n\n* As of this recording, Josh is about a year into writing the book and is close to having a rough draft finished but feels he will need to reconstruct a lot of things to make the book more coherent. \n\n## 14:04 - Differentiated and More Intense \n\n* [[Reclaim]] is different than Josh's smart notes book in the sheer amount of information he's putting into it. \n\n* Part 1 is about the ways technology has invaded our lives. \n\n* Part 2 is about taking back the linear mind (reading and establishing habits). \n\n* Part 3 is about how to perform deep work without taking the monastic philosophy.  See also [Episode 142](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-2-the-structure/) for more on deep work philosophies. [[Deep Work]] [[Episode 142]]\n\n* The amount of research Josh has needed to do for the book has been…intense. \n\n* In this book, Josh is blending some of the ideas of deep work with [[digital minimalism]]. \n\n* Josh has struggled with what is too much, whether he should  split into two books, etc. \n\n* Overall it's been a fun experience, and Josh has enjoyed sharing struggles, learnings, and triumphs. \n\n* Josh has put much of his work on [GitHub](https://github.com/Duffney) to build in public and be transparent. #GitHub \n\n* It holds Josh accountable, and hopefully it adds value to others in some capacity. \n\n* For a long time Josh had a single [vault in Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults) for everything. \n\n* He moved all the notes for Reclaim into its own project vault and stores other notes on writing, Azure, GoLang, etc. in a general vault. \n\n* Josh wanted to be able to open everything that is Reclaim and shut it once finished. \n\n* Nick mentioned John was the mastermind behind Nerd Journey's Deep Work series of episodes (starts with [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/)) and that the smart notes approach was used by John to make the outline. \n\n* Listen to the back story of how those episodes came to be, how John utilized quotes, and how he pulled ideas from the book by Cal Newport. \n\n## 19:32 - Changing Social Media Habits \n\n* As mentioned in [Episode 124](https://nerd-journey.com/focus-create-and-iterate-with-josh-duffney-2-2/), Josh was doing a write only experiment on social media so that he would only read and respond to posts on Fridays but could create posts any other time. [[Episode 124]]\n\n* This is constantly in flux. \n\n* The experiment worked well to get him away from the tools and break the addiction. \n\n* It ultimately did not stick.  What Josh does now is check social media for about 30 minutes each day.   \n\n* Checking social media only one time per week made him too disconnected and isolated, but it was a great way to reset.  If you're not willing to ban yourself for a month the responding on Fridays is a good way to help reset. \n\n* In a pandemic situation, an online community may be a substitute for in-person community, and throwing that away can be much harder than when an in-person community is more accessible. \n\n* It's fascinating how much we project our relationships onto social media. \n\n* A couple of years ago Josh decided to unfollow a lot of folks on Twitter and move them to a list as an experiment.  That got him kicked out of an online community and had massive repercussions.  Getting unfollowed certainly is unsettling. \n\n* People respect your disconnection from social media, but when you're away for an extended period of time, people may feel like you've thrown away a relationship with them.  Right now Josh is trying to find the balance. \n\n* It's amazing how much of the psychology of in person interactions transfers to online interactions (on social media platforms). \n\n* This makes Nick think back to [Episode 149](https://nerd-journey.com/find-your-gratitude-find-your-joy-with-chris-wahl-2-2/) with [[Chris Wahl]]. [[Episode 149]] \n\n* Josh says the changes from the first detox to now with his 30 minute window have been enough to keep him from getting addicted again. \n\n* His number of impressions / likes have gone down.  When you're away for a while the algorithm docks you.   \n\n* Josh is trying to let SEO and word of mouth be the marketing instead of trying to use social media platforms for attention. \n\n## 25:22 - The Knowledge Worker \n\n* Josh was doing a weekly newsletter for many months and got to about 1000 subscribers.   \n\n* After the smart notes book Josh penned (which in reality took about 7 months of research), he thought about writing e-books exclusively (not a good idea). \n\n* Just writing books is painful. \n\n* Josh missed writing short form content. \n\n* Josh will be bringing back the newsletter in some form (you can find it [here](https://theknowledgeworker.substack.com/)), but it won't necessarily be weekly.  He will use it to share some of the points to be made in Reclaim (but in online articles). \n\n## 27:19 - Finding the Extra Time \n\n* Josh has recently been speaking at conferences.   \n\n* Not having a smart phone allowed Josh to take back 3.5 hours of his life. \n\n* During the day he practices time blocking.  Each hour has a dedicated spot.  It's about being super intentional about the things he wants to do. \n\n* A while back Josh used something called Moment to track time, but the app disappeared.  Josh used Wellbeing on Android to track time on mobile devices and [Rescue Time](https://www.rescuetime.com/) on desktop / laptop computers (not free but has a 2-week free trial).   \n\n* You probably only need 2 weeks to get what Josh calls a demand analysis (which Josh heard referenced in [Making Work Visibile](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Work-Visible-Exposing-Optimize/dp/1942788150) by [[Dominica DeGrandis]]). [[Making Work Visible]] \n\n* John invested in a [TimeFlip](https://timeflip.io/) as Don Jones mentioned in [Episode 138](https://nerd-journey.com/apprentice-amplifier-and-people-developer-with-don-jones-2-2/).  [[Don Jones]] [[Episode 138]]\n\n* Listen to John's description of how he uses this device to track time spent on his work and measure what matters. \n\n* Josh integrates physical activity into his schedule. \n\n* There are 3 buckets of energy (emotional, mental, physical - all of these feed the other).  Josh has found the physical activity is essential to maintain high productivity. \n\n* Four days per week Josh does a weightlifting routine called the [5/3/1](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/531-method/) in the mornings.  That seems to be the best time of day for Josh. \n\n* Nick asks about the concept of embracing boredom from [[Deep Work]] (see also [Episode 144](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-4-embracing-boredom/)) as part of the workout. [[Episode 144]]\n\n* Josh will bring his notebook with him and jot down ideas if they come to him during that time.   \n\n* Lately he wants to get out of his head.  It is uncomfortable to be there all the time, and Josh understands why people seek distraction.  He tries to be present and enjoy the workout. \n\n* Nick thought of [Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain/dp/0316113514) by [[John J. Ratey]] when hearing about Josh's workouts. [[Spark]]\n\n* John references [Your Brain at Work](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Brain-Work-Revised-Updated/dp/B0862H6Q91) by [[David Rock]]. [[Your Brain at Work]]  \n* This seems to compliment deep work, [[Digital Minimalism]], and taking [[Smart Notes]] in that the author speaks of brain chemistry and structuring your work day. \n\n## 34:44 - Data-driven Writing \n\n* In his role at Microsoft, Josh had to get comfortable with the research and writing and get comfortable with that process.  There's also the search engine optimization (SEO) side and writing for the web (which Josh has been learning a lot about lately). #SEO \n\n* Josh has had to think about how to write more clearly so search engines and people can find what he is writing.   \n\n* It's interesting and terrifying how good algorithms are at catching human behavior. \n\n* Josh is learning to use data to be a data driven writer. \n\n* Josh has also learned about information architecture and [UX](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design). \n\n* [The Paradox of Choice](https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005696) is often cited in UX research. [[The Paradox of Choice]]\n\n* It's amazing how much you can use data to improve your writing. \n\n* Nick cites how many great book recommendations have come from Josh. \n\n* Josh mentions maybe he can publish his notes from reading different books to share with others (i.e. a SparkNotes version). \n\n* After Nick mentions samples available on Audible, Josh says there's a concept of x-raying a book mentioned in [[How to Read a Book]] that is interesting.  There's no great way to simulate touching a physical book, but audio format is helpful for skimming. \n\n* John mentions [Google Books](https://books.google.com/) and the ability to preview a book's contents without reading the whole thing. \n\n* Kindle apparently has an x-ray feature worth checking out. \n\n# 40:44 - Parting Thoughts \n\n* Josh wrote a course to go along with his Obsidian book.   \n\n* It was released on a paid platform but not at the level of craftsmanship Josh wanted (being a former author for Pluralsight), but Josh decided to refund people's money and has moved the video series to a YouTube playlist (which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5tkaGAzZPyo527K4sJQbyM9FcRV86RM_)). \n\n* This was also a great way to contribute back to the community that helped Josh when he first started learning Obsidian. \n\n* Josh has offered to give away a couple of free copies of his book, How to Take Smart Notes in Obsidian. \n\n* We'll take a random sampling from the people who retweet the announcement of the first episode with Josh in this series of interviews (Episode 156) and send them a free copy. \n\n* John was not previously using Obsidian for knowledge management before he read Josh's book. \n\n* You can pre-order Josh's new book Reclaim [here](https://joshduffney.gumroad.com/l/re-claim). \n\n* See also Scott Lowe's thoughts on writing making us all better communicators in [Episode 152](https://nerd-journey.com/the-theme-of-your-career-with-scott-lowe-1-2/).  [[Scott Lowe]] [[Episode 152]]\n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-158":{"title":"Episode 158","content":"\n# Episode 158\n\nWelcome to episode 158 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 1 of our interview with Andy Syrewicze, talking through his journey in IT from contractor for a school to experience manufacturing on into a MSP and into management.  We'll talk through how fearlessness and hunger helped Andy increase his responsibilities and as a result, his blast radius. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 12-29-2021 \n\nTopics – Meet [[Andy Syrewicze]], Fear and the #BlastRadius, Life in the #Manufacturing World, Teaching the Users, Getting Cut, Brief #Unemployment, #MSP Life, The Hunger Games, Moving to #TeamLead #Fired #TechnicalEvangelist #SubStack \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:58 - Meet Andy Syrewicze \n\n* [Andy Syrewicze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asyrewicze/) is a Technical Evangelist for [Altaro Software](https://www.altaro.com/) (now part of Hornet Security).   #AltaroSoftware #HornetSecurity\n\n* With the acquisition, Andy's responsibility area has grown to more than just backup, touching e-mail security and Microsoft 365 security. \n\n* Andy had a lot of interest in computer games as a kid (with a 486 being his first computer). \n\n* He started tinkering enough to get really interested in computers in general. \n\n* In high school he took every tech class available. \n\n* They would tear computers apart in class at school, and Andy built his own computers at home (including one with a very new AMD Athlon 64). \n\n* In the summer of his junior year he went to work for his high school doing IT (desktop administration, refreshing labs, etc.).  One of the first projects was upgrading Windows 98 to Windows 98 SE. \n\n* This was an interesting and unique experience in that Andy was providing tech support to some of his former teachers and other faculty who would be his teachers the following year. \n\n## 8:00 - Fear and the Blast Radius \n\n* John mentions people are often successful because they have lost the fear of breaking something.  People are inhibited from becoming more familiar with technology because they are fearful of breaking something. \n\n* When Andy was in high school doing desktop support, he had very little fear of breaking things and faith in himself to resolve any issue he could create. \n\n* After graduating, Andy went to work for the school full time (his first full time IT job). \n\n* Andy could resolve most issues on his own, but one time he accidentally deleted an application share from a file server (a very critical one in fact).   \n\n* Andy was at one of the school's remote sites and had to call his boss to take a look (who verified the data was gone). \n\n* Andy went to retrieve the tape to restore the data from backup. \n\n* Luckily everything restored as expected using BackupExec, but Andy learned a valuable lesson to check (multiple times) before doing things that affect data.  He was probably 19 at the time this happened. \n\n* In the earliest part of Andy's career, the lack of fear enabled him to get his hands dirty in areas where others might not have ventured. \n\n* Once you reach a certain level, one must develop a healthy respect for the data, and you become a more seasoned technology professional in similar situations. \n\n* When your blast radius is smaller, tinkering becomes ok.  But when the blast radius becomes larger, exercise caution. \n\n* Andy makes the point that for some IT professionals today the blast radius could be the entire US west coast when working for a major cloud provider. \n\n* Backup is nice, but recovery is what people really want in a tough situation. \n\n## 13:41 - Life in the Manufacturing World \n\n* Andy worked for the school as a full-time contractor for a couple of years. \n\n* He began doing a little work on the side during this time, picking up odd jobs. \n\n* Andy did some work for a different school system in the area and for a manufacturing company where some of his friends worked. \n\n* Andy's friends knew the folks in IT and got him on as a contractor.  This experience led to his later full-time role for a manufacturing company. \n\n* It was a big jump from supporting a school system in IT to supporting a large manufacturing company. \n\n* This was a big jump into the corporate space and had a very different user base. \n\n* Andy worked for a branch site (a single plant) at the manufacturing company and was not part the larger team that services the entire organization.  The plant Andy supported had 400-600 users, and his team answered to the larger corporate IT organization. \n\n* Looking back, he is thankful he was not part of the larger IT organization.  It was a good introduction to corporate culture, budgets, etc. \n\n* Andy and his team remained pretty autonomous as long as they met certain criteria with the exception of software licensing being controlled by central IT \n\n* Andy and team even ran their own Exchange server for the plant at the time. \n\n* There were sometimes mandates that came from corporate IT, but if Andy and team needed to buy new physical servers, for example, they had their own budget and reached their own decisions with very little input from corporate IT. \n\n## 18:18 -  Teaching the Users \n\n* Nick makes the point that while someone can be a very talented machine operator out in the shop, that person may not be extremely computer savvy (seems more prevalent in manufacturing than perhaps in other fields). \n\n* Andy agrees based on his experience.  Most people knew how to open and use the programs the needed to do the job well enough, but that was really it. \n\n* Nick suggests there was an element of education in Andy's role at the manufacturing plant to helping end users that is not vastly different than what he does now. \n\n* Andy was one of the first to volunteer to go and help people, fixing the issue for them and teaching them what to do if it happens again.  The teaching aspect has always been a passion for Andy. \n\n* John points out that we learn the things we like early on and then tend toward those directions and areas as we progress. \n\n## 21:19 - Getting Cut \n\n* Andy was with the manufacturing company for a couple of years.  The manufacturer was in automotive supply chain, and Andy was there in 2007 around the time with the automotive industry started to struggle quite a bit.   \n\n* This was around the time the housing market struggled / began to struggle too.  Consumer spending in a lot of areas slowed down considerably. \n\n* Andy's company started to struggle a bit.  He was a contractor at this time (in 2007) and received an e-mail letting him know \"next Friday is going to be your last day with us.\"  \n\n* Andy refers to this as being a line item on a spreadsheet and nothing more. \n\n* Andy remembers reading the e-mail.  It felt like the earth fell out from beneath him.  Andy was married at the time (no children yet), but there was a very real fear that took over. \n\n* Andy started applying for any role that looked to be a fit for him in the IT space. \n\n* Andy ultimately ended up at a MSP (managed service provider) and was no longer a contractor (full-fledged employee this time). \n\n* Andy started as a System Engineer Level 1 and ended up working at the MSP for around 10 years in various roles. \n\n* The job at the manufacturing company was where he began the transition from desktop support to dabbling in server related items like Active Directory, Exchange, and Sharepoint. \n\n* The MSP really broadened Andy's experience because when you work for a MSP you touch a lot of different stuff for a lot of different organizations. \n\n* At this point Andy was looking for a full time position (having been married not long before).   \n\n* The contract positions earlier in his career allowed flexibility and multiple experience, but with priority shifts to providing for a family, the benefits that come with being a full-time employee were needed. \n\n## 26:30 - Brief Unemployment \n\n* Andy was unemployed for less time than he was expecting (turned out to be only about 6 weeks). \n\n* His direct boss at the manufacturing company graciously gave him 2 weeks notice before his job ended.  That was pretty impressive considering Andy had domain administrator access.  He and his boss also had a great rapport. \n\n* Andy was more concerned with how he would pay rent and how he would live and didn't have time to get depressed about it.   \n\n* He was confident about what he could do but needed to find someone to pay him to do it.   \n\n* There was definitely fear involved, but he didn't let it become a focal point. \n\n* After Andy read the e-mail about his employment coming to an end he walked into his boss' office to see if there's anything that could be done differently. \n\n* The boss shared that every department was being asked to slash budgets by around 20-30%.  Andy was the low man on the totem pole in the local IT group. \n\n* After this conversation, Andy understood it wasn't him but rather an external factor beyond his control. \n\n* Andy got a good reference out of this situation, and it worked out well for him. \n\n* There are many who apply to hundreds of jobs and don't hear back from prospective employers (depending on the market at the time).  John has talked to a number of people and then looked at their resume only to realize the person didn't format it correctly to highlight their top skills. \n\n* None of us tends to be an expert at finding another job (with the possible exception of contractors who have to find the next job before the end of their existing contract is up). \n\n* It's kind of like being in sales as well as the business of your trade at the same time. \n\n* Nick believes past guest David Klee would have some comments to make on this.  Listen to David's experience as a consultant and starting his own business in [Episode 119](https://nerd-journey.com/tinkering-into-specialty-with-david-klee-1-2/) and [Episode 120](https://nerd-journey.com/a-time-to-build-with-david-klee-2-2/). \n\n* Once John got into technical sales, he looked at his resume and job hunting in a totally different way, trying to sell recruiters on the resume. \n\n* It's one thing to sell a technical solution that solves a problem.  Don Jones advised in [Episode 137](https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/) to know the problem you solve.  [[Episode 137]]\n\n## 34:34 - MSP Life \n\n* Working for a MSP is kind of a mixed bag.  They have the reputation of get as much accomplished as possible with as few engineers as possible.  The flip side is you're going to learn more about general IT than you may have ever wanted to know. \n\n* At the branch of the MSP where Andy worked, they supported several nonprofits of varying sizes with shoestring budgets. \n\n* This was the first time in Andy's career that he truly saw the impact of his work with end users at these companies (i.e. helping these nonprofits further their purpose). \n\n* Andy moved up from Systems Engineer to Virtual Systems Administrator (or VSA). \n\n* He would get assigned organizations that were large enough to see benefit from having a Systems Administrator but did not want to hire their own. Andy was the stand in Virtual Systems Administrator for about 15-20 customers. \n\n* As a result of this change, Andy relocated to be closer to the MSP's main office and gained experience serving customers in various industries (government, manufacturing, education, service organizations, etc.).    \n\n* Andy split his time 50/50 between remote support and in-person support of the customers (most were local to the area) with the end goal of being able to support all customers remotely. \n\n* There was little to no travel involved in Andy's previous roles. \n\n## 39:25 - The Hunger Games \n\n* This was the phase of Andy's career where he was extremely \"hungry,\" wanting to go and learn everything he could (in new areas like storage, SANs, networking, etc.). \n\n* He would shadow other engineers frequently and ask questions about the work people did. \n\n* Andy's management at the time recognized his ambition and gave him the opportunities to advance.  Any time he was promoted was always a direct result of Andy pushing to learn more or advocating for himself with management. \n\n* By the end of his stint at the MSP, he was a Senior Cloud Systems Administrator. \n\n* The MSP owned and operated a very large datacenter running vSphere that hosted a number of customer-facing services (file servers, RDS farms, anything customers did not want to host themselves). \n\n* This highly redundant, multi-tenant environment was an area of extreme focus during Andy's last two years with the MSP (which made for a huge blast radius).  It supported about 50 customers. \n\n* For Andy, all of the growth was really about learning.   \n\n* The title changes and pay raises were a nice perk to continuing his learning.  He looked at the growth from the standpoint of being a provider also and what he could do to better provide for and support his family. \n\n## 43:28 - Moving to Team Lead \n\n* At one point during his stint at the MSP, he was a manager.  Nick remembers hearing about this from Andy's AmpNavigator 2021 talk. \n\n* Andy was growing tired of being on call and the 2 AM phone call about something being broken. \n\n* He was getting tired of being the guy in the trenches turning the knobs and running the scripts. \n\n* Andy was already looking for what might be next for him. \n\n* He had become aware of Microsoft's (at the time) Tech Evangelism team and remembers seeing a webinar with Simon Perryman. \n\n* Andy was hosting a weekly education session for the rest of his peers at the MSP on some technical topic or a best practice and thought it would be interesting to do this as a job. \n\n* At the time, Andy pitched the idea of him being in an evangelist type role to the MSP, but they didn't like it.  That would be taking someone in a role with billable time and turning it into non-billable time. \n\n* The company didn't want to lose Andy, so they made him the team lead of their NetOps team.  He stayed in this role for about a year before moving to his next company. \n\n* The hardest part about moving to the team lead position was going from friendly co-worker to the person assigning tasks to others and asking people to stay after hours to fix something. \n\n* Andy tried to make up for it by letting people come in late if they had stayed after hours (remembering his days in that same role as the break / fix technician).  \n\n* Andy managed the team's personnel resources but also acted as a technical backstop for the team of 5-6 people. \n\n* Career progression, whether as an individual contributor or as a manager, generally involves increasing your blast radius.  That can be in the form of taking on more responsibility (i.e. going from answering questions for end users to being responsible for a large datacenter's operations like Andy did). \n\n* Sometimes you need to move to a bigger stage to enlarge the blast radius.  And that could mean moving into management, for example. \n\n* Any time Andy made a change in his career (new role, new company), he took time to understand the responsibilities this would require to ensure he was ok with it before saying yes. \n\n* This goes back to Andy's experience early in his career with deleting the application share when he was working for the school.  It taught him there were consequences for certain things. \n\n* Taking on additional responsibility without the systems in place to support the enlarged blast radius would increase the changes for mistakes. \n\n* When thinking back on the massive datacenter he managed, Andy says N + 1 was not enough.  He wanted N + 2. \n\n* Episodes mentioned in the outro: \n\n* [Episode 76](https://nerd-journey.com/engineer-brain-and-career-philosophy-with-josh-fidel/) with Josh Fidel -

In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Andy Syrewicze, discussing Andy's shift into Technical Evangelism as a career and how the Microsoft MVP helped him get there. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 12-29-2021 \n\n[Andy Syrewicze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asyrewicze/) is a Technical Evangelist for [Altaro Software](https://www.altaro.com/) (now part of Hornet Security).  Check out part 1 of our interview with Andy in [Episode 158](https://nerd-journey.com/the-ever-expanding-blast-radius-with-andy-syrewicze-1-3/).  Get the full details on what Andy is up to and ways to contact him [here](https://github.com/asyrewicze), and don't forget to [subscribe to his Substack](https://anxioustechy.substack.com/).  [[Andy Syrewicze]] #AltaroSoftware #HornetSecurity [[Episode 158]] #SubStack #TechnicalEvangelist \n\nTopics – Seeking Something Different, #ProofOfWork, #Marketing Is Interesting, The #MicrosoftMVP \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:35 - Seeking Something Different \n\n* After the webinar with [[Simon Perryman]] and becoming aware of the Technical Evangelism path, Andy made the decision he wanted to pursue something like it. \n\n* The MSP didn't want to lose him, said he was good with people, and Andy gave it a try (\"ok, yeah, I'll try that\"). \n\n* Andy didn't really like the management role but also really didn't dislike it.  It was merely not quite what he wanted to do. * Andy had started his own blog and wrote from time to time, making YouTube videos here are there also. \n\n* Andy got hooked up with the folks at Altaro who suggested he write some blogs for them, which he had been doing for a couple of years when he became the team lead at the MSP. \n\n* On a whim, Andy sent his contact at Altaro an e-mail suggesting they create a position within Altaro that covered what he was doing for them and a bit more as well as the business value of creating such a position. \n\n* The contact person said the idea was interesting, and a couple of weeks later, Altaro wanted Andy to come visit and discuss the idea.  They made him and offer to be a Technical Evangelist for Altaro, and he accepted. \n\n* There was no question in Andy's mind about wanting to pursue the Technical Evangelism path over managing a team at the MSP. \n\n* The MSP did what they could within the confines of their business model to support what Andy wanted to pursue.  In the end it didn't work out. \n\n* With Andy's desire for Technical Evangelism, the MSP may have seen it as something they would end up losing (i.e. a billable resource), but the folks at Altaro heard only about the benefits of what they would gain. \n\n## 7:55 - Proof of Work \n\n* Altaro paid Andy for the articles he wrote for them and for doing webinars on the side (before he became their Technical Evangelist).  They knew he could both write and speak. \n\n* The extra money was certainly nice, but it was also extremely exciting for Andy to be doing some of the things he really wanted to do. \n\n* Andy was able to get some at bats and experience at what he wanted to do while still employed at the MSP and later used that as proof of work for what would be next for his career (easily transitioning to Tech Evangelist at Altaro). \n\n* This is similar to what Scott Lowe shared with us in [Episode 153](https://nerd-journey.com/creating-a-full-stack-career-with-scott-lowe-2-2/) on the \"adjacent possible.\" \n\n* Thinking back to the moment where he to took the time to send the e-mail to Altaro, it was an instance of putting himself out there, taking a chance, and having it work out. \n\n* Andy painted a picture to his future employer of what could be based on what they already knew he was capable of doing (i.e. he made the sale of the company needing a new role and that he was the right person for it).  Not everyone thinks to do this. \n\n* Andy feels like he might have been doing this within the different departments at the MSP but not to an external company like Altaro (until it happened). \n\n## 12:23 - Marketing Is Interesting \n\n* Andy's role at Altaro made him part of the marketing team as a technical resource. \n\n* The only customers Andy would interact with would be prospects (i.e. Pre-Sales). \n\n* He was experienced in Pre-Sales from his time at the MSP and mentioned this when suggesting Altaro hire him.  Andy acted as a technical Pre-Sales resource for the US for the product set.  It was about 80% Technical Marketing and 20% Pre-Sales. \n\n* Andy might also interact with customers and partners at conferences here and there, but he was never in a tech support type role at Altaro. \n\n* Usually IT skills progression is technically driven.  At the time Andy joined Altaro, he had a lot of technical experience under his belt (including being designated as a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/)). \n\n* In the first few years in the role and even now that he's back at Altaro, Andy is learning more about marketing than he ever intended. \n\n* This includes elements of social media, community building, and search engine optimization (SEO). \n\n* Andy never set out to be a marketer, but that is part of the technical evangelist role.   \n\n* There are parts of every role that people don't like, but there are parts of marketing that Andy finds super interesting. \n\n* Prospect personas - who is the target audience for a product, an article, etc. \n\n* These skills were exceptionally valuable when it came to public speaking.   \n\n* Instead of worrying about what he would discuss in a presentation, Andy began focusing more on the audience (something he was not as mindful of before). \n\n* This took Andy's public speaking to the next level because he was taking his knowledge and molding it into something the audience (i.e. people with a business focus, people with a technical focus) could easily digest and understand. \n\n* Something very interesting and way more complicated than Andy ever imagined is search engine optimization (SEO), kind of like Calculus and rocket science combined. \n\n## 18:36 - The Microsoft MVP \n\n* Around 2013, Andy attended Microsoft TechEd (now named Ignite) in New Orleans. \n\n* At this event, he got roped into the community (a networking group called [The Krewe](https://twitter.com/thekrewe?lang=en) in addition to absorbing the technical content. \n\n* Through the contacts made in this group Andy became aware of the Microsoft MVP designation.  People started asking him if he was one based on the things he was doing. \n\n* Andy also got the chance to get to know [Keith Mayer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithm/), a Microsoft Technical Evangelist in the midwest. \n\n* Keith was a big mentor to Andy at that point in his career, bringing him into a webinar series called Hyper-V from a VMware Admin's Perspective. \n\n* Andy looked at past view counts of other videos in the series and saw it was in the 150,000 - 200,000 range.  It was a weird, almost out of body experience and the first time Andy had done anything at that scale. It was also a time where he felt a large amount of anxiety when doing a speaking engagement. \n\n* This experience eventually led Keith to nominate Andy for the Microsoft MVP.  Andy had to fill out an application with his contributions and describe their impact / reach for a group of reviewers. \n\n* The MVP has different areas in which it is awarded (awarded once per year).  Andy came on originally in the Hyper-V category after coming from a former VMware administration background. \n\n* They have since changed the categories for MVP.  At present Andy is considered cloud and datacenter management (includes Windows Server, Hyper-V, PowerShell, Azure, AzureStack).  \n\n* Some categories like the .NET MVP require code contributions to be considered. \n\n* Being an MVP gets you the designation for a one year period.  Each year Andy has to resubmit contributions made during the time since the previous application period, and then it's a waiting game to see if he got into the program for another year. \n\n* The level of effort was about the same to stay in the program after he joined Altaro compared to when he still worked for the MSP and was awarded MVP. \n\n* Take advantage of other programs like the Microsoft MVP that you can involve yourself in: \n\n* [Cisco Champion](https://community.cisco.com/t5/cisco-champion-public-documents/faqs/ta-p/3986825) \n\n* [Veeam Vanguard](https://www.veeam.com/vanguard.html) \n\n* [VMware vExpert](https://vexpert.vmware.com/) \n\n* Also check out [Episode 36](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-036-customer-advocacy-programs/) on Customer Advocacy Programs for more ideas. \n\n* Much like certification, the benefit is the journey (getting involved in the community, contributing content, helping others). \n\n* Andy cannot say enough positive things about the Microsoft MVP community. \n\n* If he doesn't know the answer to a specific IT question, he knows someone who does. \n\n* It's humbling to be a part of the program.  There are also times when the impostor syndrome creeps in. \n\n* Andy feels like the MVP award was additional verification for the folks at Altaro that Andy could do the work needed to be a Technical Evangelist. \n\n* Should we do a show on SEO (search engine optimization) to help bloggers, podcasters, and other content creators in the community?  Please let us know what you think! \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-16":{"title":"Episode 16","content":"\n# Episode 16\n\nTopic 1 – Reasons not to Pursue a Career Opportunity (Pre-Application Stage), Part 1 of 2 \n\nWe're highlighting some content from a Manager Tools 10-part podcast series on choosing a company to work for \n\n3:29 [Choosing A Company To Work For -

Discovering Anxiety \n\n* Growing up and even into early adulthood, Andy was told he was laid back.  When you hear things like that you kind of take them as part of your personality. \n\n* Now that Andy knows he has an anxiety disorder, he can look back at stages of his career and get some interesting insights. \n\n* There were times were he appeared very driven in his career.  He was actually very anxious during those times.  When younger, he would take the anxiety (the extra energy) and put it into what was next (which is not sustainable and was really him internalizing the problem). \n\n* Andy has [generalized anxiety disorder](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad).  It means you have an excess of worry, and you may not even know what it is about.  Andy spoke about this in a 2-part presentation for AmpNavigator 2021. \n\n* Andy's struggle when first aware that he had the disorder was looking at the anxiety as a problem to solve.   \n\n* Sometimes anxiety is unexplainable.  This can cause extra worry when you're trying to figure out why it is happening. \n\n* At one point Andy had the opportunity to go and work for his dream organization. \n\n* It was a situation where he knew the right people, a new team was being created with multiple openings, and he had sort of side stepped the hiring process. \n\n* Every conversation as a part of this endeavor was very positive.  Andy then heard nothing for a couple of weeks, and when he followed up he received nothing more than a generic \"you're not the right fit for this.\" \n\n* In terms of his anxiety, this was the glass shattering.  There were some cracks made at different points (i.e. his wife telling him that he might have an anxiety issue). \n\n* When Andy was let go from the manufacturing company, it did not really affect him.  Missing out on this specific opportunity to work for his dream organization was shattering for his self-confidence.   \n\n* Impostor syndrome became a large part of daily life at this point in time. \n\n* Instead of the anxiety pushing him forward like before, it turned into something much more destructive.   \n\n* Having that seemingly easy shot at a dream job and missing it really shined a light on anxiety as an underlying problem.  After this, he had constant anxiety on a daily basis.  Things only made more sense after professional diagnosis and therapy. \n\n* Sometimes people don't understand mental health disorders.  We all have anxiety in our lives, but not everyone has a debilitating anxiety that keeps them from functioning at work, home, etc. \n\n* We need to deal with these types of issues the same way we would if we broke our leg (seek professional help). \n\n* There's a distinction between a disorder and a phase. \n\n* To take an example, Andy would be going along at work and notice he was worried about something.  \n\n* He used to cope with these types of things with avoidance.  Avoidance could mean he'd go tinker with something technical (i.e. doing things with technology to distract himself). \n\n* Listen to Andy's example about how helping an end user with a ticket can make the person feel.  He feels equally appreciative of therapists because of how they've positively impacted him. \n\n* Therapists tend to queue up thought processes that help you see / understand what's been happening.  \n\n* Every time you help someone with a ticket in IT, you bring with it all of your experience (your seat time, number of repetitions / at bats).  It is similar with therapists (who have many patients with some of the same problems). \n\n* One of John's favorite things gleaned from a therapist was blatant honest about how his feeling / situation was not unique (i.e. what is happening is well within the pattern). \n\n* Once Andy understood his struggles fit within a defined pattern for which there is a set of solutions available, his brain translated that to mean there is a roadmap for the future with skill gaps to fill (not unlike something technical). \n\n## 17:52 - Warning Signs \n\n* Nick mentioned the value of an outside perspective on the situation (someone outside your family / close friends). \n\n* Andy had very few external symptoms and internalized everything. \n\nAndy's wife picks up on all the hints and clues that he is anxious (even able to detect it when he walks into a room). \n\n* Before diagnosis, the anxiety may have broken out for Andy in the form of getting irritated over something silly or reacting to situations in ways that were over the top. \n\n* Listen to Andy's example scenario about his son throwing up in the car unexpectedly.   \n\n* There were also a number of self-destructive thoughts that happened after he missed out on the dream job opportunity. \n\n* This is one of the catalysts for going to seek outside help. \n\n* John makes a great analogy about scabs and scar tissue that build up after continued internalization of anxiety. \n\n* As we get older, the level of responsibility increases and can increase anxiety. \n\n* Andy had essentially been holding a 10-pound weight straight out in front of him for years and couldn't hold it any longer. \n\n## 23:46 - Breaking Point and Seeking Help \n\n* Andy was always a little hesitant to go see a therapist.  The last thing he wanted to do while anxious was talk about his anxiety. \n\n* There will come a point where you decide \"I don't want to feel like this any more.\" \n\n* You get to a point where you are done with it. \n\n* When he called to make an appointment there was no hesitation. \n\n* He felt hesitation driving to the first appointment but never since. \n\n* The entire process was therapeutic for Andy.  It was not easy, of course.  There were sessions he had that at the time did not feel like they were valuable (but really were in the larger scheme of things). \n\n* If you're on the fence about therapy… \n\n* Know you are not alone. \n\n* The process works.  It helps.  It's a set of skills you need to learn just like a specific technology.   \n\n* At the very least, if you are curious and are told you do not have an anxiety disorder, at least you know. \n\n* Asking for help does not make you weak. It makes you stronger because you've made a decision. \n\n* Andy found comfort in knowing he had made a decision. \n\n* Great quote from John White - \"I'm kind of worried about our backups, but if I go and check and ask an expert, that will make it real.  And I'll actually have a problem.\" \n\n* We likely will see evidence of a physical ailment like a broken leg, but anxiety, for example, is less visible.  People may have worked with Andy every day and never knew he had anxiety. \n\n* Andy believes there were probably only a handful of people who even suspected there was a problem. \n\n* If the issue is not external, something like anxiety can be perceived as a lack of strength. \n\n* It seems like our society is becoming more aware of how many mental health disorders exist and that they should be treated (much like we would do for a physical ailment). \n\n* One of the ways Andy's anxiety manifested was that he didn't feel \"hungry\" like he had earlier on in his career.  He didn't have the passion to go learn something new and missed that. \n\n* Andy was not being as effective as he could have been.   \n\n* \"I was like a SAN that was running in a degraded fashion.\" - Andy Syrewicze \n\n* Andy needed to get back to where he was and find some ways to mitigate his disorder's effects. \n\n## 30:51 - Coping Strategies \n\n* Many of the strategies that work for Andy in managing his anxiety center around the concept of mindfulness. \n\n* Actually playing out his anxiety - trying to figure out the cause and what it is / what he can do about it, but if nothing, accept and move on. \n\n* Andy had to accept that sometimes he will not know what he is anxious about and that it is ok. \n\n* If there is a situation where Andy is feeling a high degree of anxiety that is preventing him from doing whatever he is trying to do (blog, make a video, etc.), he has a quick helpful exercise called 5 senses: \n\n* What are 5 things in the room I can see? \n\n* What are 4 things I can touch? \n\n* What are 3 things I can smell? \n\n* Going through your senses in this way pulls your mind from where your anxiety is into the present. \n\n* Andy also likes to do a daily journaling exercise detailing what went well during that day, what he was happy about that day, and what could have gone better. \n\n* A mental health professional may have other tools for you,  and consider the list of tools as a playbook. \n\n* Medication may also be an option for you. \n\n* There's a cultural perception of being able to take a pill to fix something as the easy way out or quick fix.  \n\n* It's too easy to say be mindful and forget how deep that actually goes. \n\n* Specific types of meditation, biofeedback, having a healthy diet, and types of exercise like yoga are all examples of applications of mindfulness practice. \n\n* Andy always had an interest in the Buddhist / Zen culture and the reliance on mindfulness.  It was interesting to see these types of things come in as recommendations to help with anxiety. \n\n* Andy will meditate from time to time using the [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) app (one of his favorites). \n\n* There is a specific session in there called [Panic SOS](https://app.www.calm.com/program/_kCx96PwDb/panic-sos) that Andy uses when he cannot function because of anxiety.   \n\n* This session takes some practice but has helped a great deal.  If you have never done meditation like this, we're talking about an audio format where someone provides instructions on posture, how to breath, and teaches you to focus your attention on your breath…all in the spirit of helping you be and stay present (which breaks the anxiety loop of doom). \n\n* Andy learned that he was rarely living in the here and now through this process. \n\n* He was thinking about something technical, something related to a video game, and never experiencing right now. \n\n* Learning about this disorder has really helped with this challenge. \n\n* There are many people who would not be able to sit alone, by themselves, in a room for an hour with nothing to do.  It would drive them insane.  As a result of learning these new skills over the past couple of years, Andy is completely comfortable doing that and being in the here and now. \n\n* Recognizing these things about ourselves is important, and it can give us fuel to take action and make positive changes. \n\n* This reminds Nick of the [[Deep Work]] series (starting with [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/)) in which we talked about taking that couple minutes between meetings and seeking to be present instead of seeking distraction (i.e. checking social media). [[Cal Newport]] [[Episode 141]]\n\n* There are a number of apps out there like Calm.  This family of apps is based on cognitive behavioral therapy. \n\n* Therapy comes in different forms, and it's mostly cognitive behavioral these days (i.e. what is the physical reaction you're having, is it healthy, what causes it, how we break the cycle). \n\n* This is practical advice like you'd get from a physical therapist. \n\n* Andy has wondered why some of these skills are not taught to kids in high school. \n\n* After you learn these new skills, it becomes so clear you almost kick yourself for not doing something about it sooner. \n\n* We only teach these to people who are a problem.  If someone is hyperactive, they get the tools to deal with that disorder.  It's similar with anxiety.  The fact is the skills are useful for everyone. \n\n## 42:43 -  Parting Thoughts \n\n* AmpNavigator was Andy's first time delving into this subject in a public facing way.  This podcast is only the second time. \n\n* Andy was touchy about sharing it at first, but looking at skills gained over his career (public speaking, ability to write and tell a story), Andy felt he needed to go and talk about this. \n\n* Andy has also been working on a [SubStack](https://substack.com/) around his experiences with anxiety and weaving in some tech too. #SubStack \n\n* One article Andy is working on is called Mindfulness Journaling Using VS Code.  There is a [VS Code Journal extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pajoma.vscode-journal) that adds hot keys to easily open up mark down entries, automatically creating a folder structure for you based on dates. [[Mindfulness]]\n\n* He's trying to teach people in tech how to deal with anxiety. \n\n* As of our recording, Andy did not have a name for the SubStack but thought about anxious musings as one option. \n\n* As a society it seems like we're coming around to addressing mental illness, but there is still work to do. \n\n* In the outro we reference these episodes:  \n\n* [Episode 140](https://nerd-journey.com/take-time-to-be-present-with-eric-brooker-2-2/) and Eric Brooker's disconnected vacation that helped him be present  [[Episode 140]]\n\n* [Episode

In today's episode we review our book goals from 2021 and set some book goals for 2022. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 02-12-2022 \n\nTopics – #2021 Year in Review, Making Reading more Deliberate, Hidden Gems, #Goals for #2022, Final Summary \n\n=========================== \n\n* We don't have a guest this week.  We're focusing on 2022 book goals and some review of our 2021 goals.   \n\n* You can hear our full list of 2021 book goals in [Episode 108](https://nerd-journey.com/2021-book-goals-from-nick-and-john/). \n\n## 2:08 - 2021 Year in Review \n\n### John \n\n* John experienced complete failure to read any of the 2021 books!  \n\n* And a lot of the ideas for books were great. As a result there will be lots of repeats. \n\n* The only things removed are the #Python, computational thinking, and data science reads.  \n\n* What John actually read: \n\n*  [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/0349411905/) by [[Cal Newport]], which changed a bunch about how John works  [[Deep Work]]\n\n* See [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/) through [Episode 147](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-7-become-hard-to-reach/) for our 7-part series on deep work. [[Episode 141]] [[Episode 147]]\n\n* Nick read this one once and then again to prepare for the deep work series of shows.  It's even better the second time through. \n\n* [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/B09HSSFCPR/) by [[Sonke Ahrens]], which also changed a bunch about how John works [[How to Take Smart Notes]] [[Zettelkasten|Smart Notes]]\n\n* This book speaks to [Zettlekasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) and developing a personal knowledge graph.  Think of it like a card catalog system. [[Zettelkasten]]\n\n* See also [Episode 156](https://nerd-journey.com/better-notes-better-you-with-josh-duffney-1-2/) and [Episode 157](https://nerd-journey.com/take-note-of-your-time-with-josh-duffney-2-2/) with [[Josh Duffney]] for an overview of the smart notes methodology and how Josh put it to use in his work. [[Episode 156]] [[Episode 157]]\n\n* [How to Take Smart Notes in Obsidian](https://joshduffney.gumroad.com/l/take-smart-notes-obsidian) by [[Josh Duffney]]  [[How to Take Smart Notes in Obsidian]]\n\n* This is a short read and is focused on getting up and running using Obsidian as a tool for smart notes.  See Josh Duffney episode references above for more details on the book (and a special discount link for listeners). \n\n* [Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game](https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818/) by [[Michael Lewis]]  [[Moneyball]]\n\n* This was not influential in my work, but I did keep seeing clips from the movie come up as YouTube recommendations.  Instead of watching the movie again I listened to the audiobook. \n\n* A fun trivia fact - John referenced Moneyball in two episodes: [Episode 90](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-the-inner-game-of-stress-by-gallwey-hanzelik-and-horton/) and [Episode 93](https://nerd-journey.com/leadership-and-supporting-employee-potential-with-paul-green/).  [[Episode 90]] [[Episode 93]]\n\n* There's some work application in regard to the use of analytics for business to be had from reading the book.  \n\n* There were two series John listened to in 2021 (fiction for personal enjoyment): \n\n* [Lee Child](https://www.amazon.com/Lee-Child/e/B000APO0PQ/)’s “Jack Reacher” series. Fiction. John learned nothing but was entertained.  [[Lee Child]] [[Jack Reacher]]\n\n* Amazon recently commissioned [a series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSycMV-_Csw) based on the first book.  John feels it was pretty faithful to the book and is an interesting exploration of the United States through the eyes of someone who is American but has never lived in the US.  If you don't mind the violence it is worth the read. \n\n* [Martha Wells](https://www.amazon.com/Martha-Wells/e/B000APZA1O)’s “The Murderbot Diaries” - Science Fiction; entertainment  [[Martha Wells]] [[The Murderbot Diaries]]\n\n* John re-listened to it because another book in the series had come out. \n\n* John is happy to talk to anyone about these last two books in more detail if interested. \n\n#### 12:27 - Making Reading more Deliberate \n\n* John wants to make reading a more deliberate task in 2022. \n\n* Visual Goals - Print out the list and place it strategically where it is visible \n\n* Dedicated Time - setting aside an hour at night for getting ready for bed then winding down the night , highlighting and taking notes as he can so they can be digested at a later time \n\n* Defined chunks - clustering the books with things he hopes to get out of them \n\n* Commitment - John purchased his #1 and #2 reads and has them ready along with what he hopes to get out of them. That’s the first chunk. \n\n### 14:05 - Nick \n\n* Nick read a few of the 2021 book goals but eventually wandered away from the list (trashed it completely).   \n\n* He continues to follow a stream of consciousness approach to focus on what seems most interesting and relevant at the time (many have come from podcast guests).   \n\n* Sometimes Nick will open up Audible and decide to go with something completely different than what is on his wish list. \n\n* Note: Nick reads 99% of his books in audio format.  \n\n* At one point Nick started suffering from information overload.  It was from too much self-help nonfiction he thinks.  This is the point where he went back to biographies.   \n\n* Nick feels like with biographies there is less pressure to apply what you learn.  You can take what you want from the biographies because a lot of it is learning about someone’s life, their story, etc.  Nick finds it allows making interesting connections / comparisons to other situations. \n\n* The books Nick wanted to read and actually did are… \n\n* [A Champion's Mind: Lessons from a Life in Tennis](https://www.amazon.com/Champions-Mind-Lessons-Life-Tennis/dp/030738330X) by [[Pete Sampras]] [[A Champion's Mind]] \n\n* Sampras had this idea of raising his game while playing within himself in addition to leading a relatively low key life for a tennis superstar. \n\n* [Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company](https://www.amazon.com/The-Ride-of-Lifetime-Robert-Iger-audiobook/dp/B07QW2LHN4) by [[Robert Iger]] [[Ride of a Lifetime]] \n\n* It was interesting to hear about Iger's growth from newsroom to CEO of Disney and the stories of being there through acquisitions like Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm.  He also had interesting thoughts on best practices for firing someone. \n\n* [George Lucas: A Life](https://www.amazon.com/George-Lucas-Brian-Jay-Jones-audiobook/dp/B01K8RQ22O) by [[Brian Jay Jones]] [[George Lucas: A Life]] \n\n* It was interesting to hear about how movie pitches are done, how treatments for scripts work, and more of the details of how Star Wars came to be. \n\n* [A Game Plan for Life: The Power of Mentoring](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Plan-Life-Power-Mentoring/dp/B0036BWR6K) by [[John Wooden]] and [[Don Yeager]] [[A Game Plan for Life]] \n\n* This was the only paperback book Nick read in 2021. \n\n* In the book, Wooden shares 6 mentors in his life and their impact on his coaching and life philosophies followed by sharing stories of 6 people he has mentored and how their lives have been affected by him. \n\n#### 19:00 - Hidden Gems \n\n* Some of the best books Nick stumbled upon are… \n\n* [Invention: A Life](https://www.amazon.com/Invention-A-Life/dp/B092161NG2) by [[James Dyson]] [[Intention: A Life]] \n\n* Nick had no clue how close we came to not having Dyson as a company.  James studied furniture design as a young man.  The book even talks about how Dyson made an electric car at one point.  This one is also narrated by James Dyson if you listen to the Audible version! \n\n* [The Big Miss: My Years Coaching Tiger Woods](https://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Miss-Hank-Haney-audiobook/dp/B007P1BI7G) by [[Hank Haney]] [[The Big Miss]] \n\n* Hank Haney narrates the audio version of this book.  He talks about the pressures of coaching an elite performer like [[Tiger Woods]] and how close someone like Tiger lets you get on a personal level.  #Coaching\n\n* [Stan Lee: The Man behind Marvel](https://www.amazon.com/Stan-Lee-Man-behind-Marvel/dp/1538128438) by [[Bob Batchelor]] [[Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel]] \n\n* Nick didn't know that Stan Lee created Spider Man and many other popular Marvel characters.  Marvel is another company that didn't come to fruition during its journey from infancy. \n\n* [The Teenage Brain: A Neuroscientist's Survival Guide to Raising Adolescents and Young Adults](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Brain-Neuroscientists-Survival-Adolescents/dp/0062067850/) by [[Frances E. Jensen]], [[Amy Ellis Nutt]] [[The Teenage Brain]] \n\n* This was written by a neuroscientist in terms that normal humans can understand.  This should be required reading for parents and teachers.  The risk analysis part of the brain for teenagers isn't fully developed.  Keep telling your kids about other teenagers who made poor choices and the consequences of those actions, and keep an open dialogue with your teens. \n\n* [So Good They Can’t Ignore](https://www.amazon.com/So-Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-audiobook/dp/B009CMO8JQ) You by [[Cal Newport]] [[So Good They Can't Ignore You]] \n\n* Newport talks about the idea of career capital, encouraging readers to go deep in a specific area until they reach the edge of that field.  In that area they will find an opportunity to move into the adjacent possible (easy to move into another field that is closely related). \n\n* [The Practice](https://www.amazon.com/The-Practice-Shipping-Creative-Work/dp/B089B7SZCN) by [[Seth Godin]]  [[The Practice]]\n\n* This was a Josh Duffney recommendation from some e-mails he and Nick exchanged. This one is about shipping creative work and will make you want to write.  Nick read it twice and really wanted to write for 20 minutes per day after reading it (but hasn't been able to do that consistently). \n\n* [The Master: The Brilliant Career of Roger Federer](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Brilliant-Career-Roger-Federer/dp/1538719266/) by [[Christopher Clarey]] [[The Master]] \n\n* [[Roger Federer]] has long been one of Nick's favorite tennis players.  It was interesting to hear how Federer dealt with the fame and what it was like being married to a former tennis star.  Nick was inspired to write [this post](https://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2021/10/23/learning-from-the-maestro/) after reading the book. \n\n* [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B0189PVAWY) by Cal Newport (read it twice) \n\n## 22:30 - Goals for 2022 \n\n### John \n\n#### Re-Reads \n\n* After adding the Zettelkasten smart-notes process, John would like to re-read some books and extract their lessons in a more permanent way. \n\n* Fun fact: John used the smart notes methodology to take notes that became our show outlines for the deep work series of episodes.   \n\n* [Thinking in Bets](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions/dp/0735216371/) by [[Annie Duke]]  [[Thinking in Bets]]\n\n* John wants to be more clear about the uncertainty that exists in his decision making and hopefully make better decisions as a result. \n\n* On a daily basis, John tries to assess how certain he is about something. \n\n* [Your Brain at Work](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Brain-Work-Revised-Updated/dp/0063076063/) by [[David Rock]] [[Your Brain at Work]] \n\n* The book is about optimizing how one works based on how the brain works, how much energy certain things take, what time of the day you have more energy, etc. It's a good compliment to some of what we read in Deep Work. \n\n* [The Talent Code](https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Code-Greatness-born-grown/dp/1847943047/) by [[Dan Coyle]] [[The Talent Code]] \n\n* John needs to remember more than “[[Deep Practice]], expert coaching, and ignition.” But he doesn't. \n\n* [The Back of the Napkin: Solving Problems and Selling Ideas with Pictures](https://www.amazon.com/Back-Napkin-Expanded-Problems-Pictures/dp/1591842697)  [[The Back of the Napkin]] [[Dan Roam]]\n\n* The book presents the idea of visual thinking and explaining complex problems by drawing simple diagrams.  John wants to develop this visual language of explanation as a skill.  \n\n* [Guns, Germs, and Steel](https://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393354326/) by [[Jared Diamond]] [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] \n\n* This is a non-fiction discussion of how geography led the faster or slower advancement of societies around the world and is one of his favorite all-time books. \n\n* Listen to the example John gives from the book about the ease of being able to get a package of food in specific countries and a little about the why. \n\n* John would love to have others read along and discuss the book. \n\n#### 30:31 - Extending the Lessons \n\n* [The Little Book of Talent: 52 Tips for Improving Your Skills](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Talent-Improving-Skills/dp/034553025X/)  [[Dan Coyle]] [[The Little Book of Talkent]]\n\n* This is another book by Dan Coyle on skill acquisition that seems more tactical in nature. \n\n* This is the first book in John's \"chunk\" that he plans to read and blog about.  Tweet at John to ask about his progress. \n\n* [Blah Blah Blah](https://www.amazon.com/Blah-What-When-Words-Dont/dp/1591844592/) by [[Dan Roam]] [[Blah Blah Blah]] \n\n* The book is about the idea of Vivid Thinking.  \n\n* “Through Vivid Thinking, we can make the most complicated subjects suddenly crystal clear. Whether trying to understand a Harvard Business School class, or what went down in the Conan versus Leno battle for late-night TV, or what Einstein thought about relativity, Vivid Thinking provides a way to clarify anything.” \n\n* This is also part of John's first chunk of reading. He'd like to be able to understand and explain complex ideas better, specifically interested in how Vivid Thinking differs from his previous Visual Thinking. \n\n* [Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise](https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise/dp/0544947223/) by Anders Ericsson.  [[Peak]]\n\n* Ericsson wrote the research paper that most of the non-fiction discussion of the 10,000 hours of practice rule came from as mentioned in other books we've read (The Talent Code, Outliers, Talent is Overrated, Deep Work, etc.). \n\n* [Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track](https://www.amazon.com/Staff-Engineer-Leadership-beyond-management/dp/1736417916/) by Will Larson \n\n* We've mentioned this before, but it's about leading without being a people manager. \n\n* Nick read this one as well as another book Will Larson wrote called [An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186) which is primarily about people leadership in software development (lessons widely applicable to other areas). \n\n* Nick remembers a recommended reading section inside Staff Engineer as suggested by the people Will Larson interviewed when writing the book. \n\n* [Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis](https://www.amazon.com/Upheaval-Turning-Points-Nations-Crisis/dp/0316409146/) by Jared Diamond \n\n* This book contains case studies on how 6 countries survived recent upheavals and whether we can apply those lessons to ourselves.  John has yet to read this one. \n\n* [[Don Jones]] mentioned in [episode 137](https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/) that he writes fiction as a hobby. John is adding [Power Wave](https://donjones.com/book/power-wave-prime-wave-accounting-1/)  [Prime Wave Accounting #1](https://donjones.com/book/power-wave-prime-wave-accounting-1/) to his list. [[Episode 137]]\n\n* Fun fact - there is also a [book 2](https://donjones.com/book/superior-wave-prime-wave-accounting-2/) in the series now. \n\n#### 36:50 - 2021 Books John Wants to Read \n\n* [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://amzn.to/3rydtQQ) by [[Andy Hunt]] [[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning]] \n\n* This is a re-read. John mentioned it as a book that has shaped his thinking in [Bonus Episode 8](https://nerd-journey.com/most-influential-books-on-my-thinking-john-white) from late 2019.   \n\n* Other than some fundamental principles he remembers from it, he feels he needs to read it again to refresh his memory. \n\n* John enjoys re-reading books. \n\n* [The Ideal Team Player - How to Recognize and Cultivate The Three Essential Virtues](https://amzn.to/3a3n64g) by [[Patrick Lencioni]] [[The Ideal Team Player]] \n\n* We reviewed another book by Lencioni in [Episode 87](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-lencionis-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/) called [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://amzn.to/2Oc6H4K) that was also quite good.  [[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team]]\n\n* John wants to hear Lencioni's thoughts on the team player concept. \n\n* The style of Lencioni's writings are usually business fable and easy to consume.  John plans to put this one early in his list to get a quick win (part of his first chunk). \n\n* He would like to compliment the vivid thinking idea from Dan Roam with personal development on being a better team player. That’s a pretty important part of John's job right now, working with a team of other Customer Engineers at #GoogleCloud. \n\n* [Success is in Your Sphere: Leverage the Power of Relationships to Achieve Your Business Goals](https://amzn.to/2ZcyZi5) by [Zvi Band](https://zvi.band/) [[Success is in Your Sphere]] [[Zvi Band]]\n\n* This one sounded intriguing based on the title. \n\n* [Strategic Relationships at Work: Creating Your Circle of Mentors, Sponsors, and Peers for Success in Business and Life](https://amzn.to/3a0rYH2) by [[Wendy Murphy]], [[Kathy Kram]] [[Strategic Relationships at Work]] \n\n* This choice was inspired by our interviews with [[Ashley Connell]] that began in [Episode 96](https://nerd-journey.com/sponsorship-dreams-and-the-path-to-entrepreneurship-with-ashley-connell/).  [[Episode 96]]\n\n* Ashley shared the difference between a mentor and a sponsor, and John would like to grow his circle of good sponsors and mentors. \n\n* Any other books in this area / thought leadership is welcome advice to us. \n\n* [Feedback That Works: How to Build and Deliver Your Message](https://amzn.to/2OczSVm) by [[Center for Creative Leadership]] [[Feedback That Works]] \n\n* In his role at Google, John is involved in a lot of peer feedback and review.  He'd like to improve in this area. \n\n* Please send recommendations for providing good feedback John's way! \n\n* [The Art of Being Indispensable at Work](https://amzn.to/2NdqYGw) by [[Bruce Tulgan]] [[The Art of Being Indespensable at Work]] \n\n* This is a title that seemed interesting to John as he definitely wants to be indispensable at work.  If he is able to read it he can report back. \n\n* [Empathy at Work](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/empathy-at-work/9781492050483/) by [[Sharon Steed]] [[Empathy at Work]] \n\n* John likes to lead relationships with empathy.  If there is a book with a good model for doing this, he would really like to hear about it. \n\n* If you have read something covering this genre of empathy at work, DM us! \n\n### 38:17 - Nick \n\n* Nick will continue to target biographies and memoirs (we remember stories better anyway) but is open to others in the nonfiction genre. \n\n* Maybe it's structured chaos or unstructured chaos (not sure).    \n\n* Interesting ideas for 2022 \n\n* [Not Dead Yet](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Dead-Yet-Phil-Collins-audiobook/dp/B01JYEUQWO) by [[Phil Collins]] [[Not Dead Yet]] \n\n* The Audible version is narrated by Phil Collins! \n\n* [Every Tool’s a Hammer](https://www.amazon.com/Every-Tools-Hammer-Adam-Savage-audiobook/dp/B07S2D2CJP) by [[Adam Savage]] [[Every Tool's a Hammer]] \n\n* Adam narrates this one too.  He was the co-host of [Mythbusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters) for a number of years. \n\n* [A Craftman’s Legacy](https://www.amazon.com/A-Craftsmans-Legacy-audiobook/dp/B07RQW8TDT) by Eric Gorges \n\n* Eric started Voodoo Choppers and later hosted a TV show called [A Craftman's Legacy](https://www.craftsmanslegacy.com/) where he interviews different craftspeople and tries to do what they do for a living.  The lessons the craftspeople have learned are widely applicable across domains. \n\n* This reminds John of [[The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection]] discussed in [Episode 145](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-5-quit-social-media/) of our [[Deep Work]] series. [[Episode 145]] [[Cal Newport]]\n\n* Nick sees himself following the thread of craftsmanship in a career because he likes the discipline it brings to your career. \n\n* The concept of being a #Builder from [[Chris Wahl]] in [Episode 148](https://nerd-journey.com/the-magic-of-building-with-chris-wahl-1-2/) also contributed to this interest as did discussions of apprenticeship with Don Jones in [Episode 138](https://nerd-journey.com/apprentice-amplifier-and-people-developer-with-don-jones-2-2/) [[Episode 148]] [[Don Jones]] [[Episode 138]]\n\n* [Own Your Tech Career](https://www.manning.com/books/own-your-tech-career) by Don Jones  [[Own Your Tech Career]] [[Don Jones]]\n\n* Nick bought a copy but has not yet read it (paper format only). \n\n* [Ghost Rules: Unspoken Secrets to Getting ahead]((https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Rules-Unspoken-secrets-getting/dp/B097CGBJ2L) by [Evan Oldford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eoldford/).  [[Ghost Rules]] [[Evan Oldford]]\n\n* Evan and Nick connected on LinkedIn, and Evan let Nick know he had written the book. \n\n* [The Story of You: An Enneagram Journey to Becoming Your True Self](https://www.amazon.com/Story-You-Enneagram-Journey-Becoming/dp/006282581X) by Ian Morgan Cron [[The Story of You]]\n\n* Nick finds the [Enneagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality) framework for personality types pretty interesting and read [The Road Back to You](https://www.amazon.com/The-Road-Back-to-You-audiobook/dp/B01M0TPG72) also by [[Ian Morgan Cron]].  [[The Road Back to You]]\n\n* [Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention - and How to Think Deeply Again](https://www.amazon.com/Stolen-Focus-Attention-Think-Deeply/dp/B09FYHKYFJ) by [[Johann Hari]] [[Stolen Focus]] \n\n* This looked well-reviewed on Audible, and with all the talks we've had about focus and distraction, Nick feels this would be a great read based on his desire to excel as an individual contributor. \n\n* [Peak Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Mind-Attention-Invest-Minutes/dp/B08V5KFRM5/) by [[Amishi P. Jha]] [[Peak Mind]] \n\n* This is about the science of attention and how it affects your memory.  The author speaks to the idea of mindfulness and its ability to improve your memory and your mind. \n\n* The idea of combining the reading with the smart notes approach is fascinating and perhaps may lead to more blogs, hopefully leading to remembering the books better and capturing some of those cross domain lessons from biographies. \n\n* Nick feels like this will lead to at least making more literature notes. \n\n## 48:11 - Final Summary \n\n* Can we hit our goals this time? \n\n* John is not going to hold himself accountable to read every single book in the list.  He does want to make sure he reads some, which will be a great improvement. \n\n* Nick likes the fact that John has a structured reading routine and time.  Nick reads a little here and there, while stretching, doing laundry, while taking a walk, etc.  He will then take a few minutes to capture thoughts. \n\n* We would love to hear interesting book recommendations from listeners! \n\n* What have you found interesting? \n\n* What strategies do you use for remembering more of what you read? \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-162":{"title":"Episode 162","content":"\n# Episode 162\n\nWelcome to episode 162 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

Talent Marketing \n\n* Talent Marketing is a bit more common in large organizations.  For example, VMware has about 37,000 employees globally.   \n\n* Employer branding may be the term more people have heard, which started getting popular about 10 years ago. \n\n* Competing for talent is more and more difficult. \n\n* VMware has to work hard to get people to apply for top talent roles, and we're competing with other large brands for this. \n\n* Louise mentioned companies want to position themselves as a great place to work and as an employer of choice, wanting to attract top talent. \n\n* If you're a great place to work and no one knows, it will be a struggle to attract that top talent that you need. \n\n* Most folks in employer branding would be marketers, but this could be shared between HR and Marketing at a smaller organization. \n\n* Louise has specialized in the e-mail marketing platform (sort of a talent marketing platform) [Beamery](https://beamery.com/) since she started with VMware and now has become the owner of the [VMware Careers Blog](https://blogs.vmware.com/careers/). \n\n* They recently launched a new section of the blog called [The Inside Scoop](https://blogs.vmware.com/careers/the-inside-scoop), and Nick wrote an article covering top tips for individual contributors (check it out [here](https://blogs.vmware.com/careers/2021/11/a-focused-path-for-growth-10-insights-from-top-vmware-individual-contributors.html)). \n\n* They plan to have recruiters, talent acquisition folks, and others give advice on The Inside Scoop on how to get hired at VMware.  \n\n* There are separate university talent teams within the company that Louise's team supports as well as many other teams inside the company with hiring needs.   \n\n* Louise thinks of her role as being at the top of the funnel.  She is focused on brand awareness / promotion of VMware as an employer of choice. \n\n* Once Louise and team drive awareness and event participation, the torch is passed to recruiters and sources to do the next part of the hiring process. \n\n* At smaller companies, Louise has worked with a number of HR (human resources) folks.  Some are very comfortable with social media usage while others are not.  It helps if someone in Digital Marketing can assist here to be responsible for the posting of jobs and maybe even create a careers page. \n\n* Ideally there would be an e-mail address or form that allows candidates to send in resumes.  But you cannot just let it sit there.  The resumes sent in must be reviewed. \n\n* Nick mentions that a company's career page is a great resource for candidates looking for work.  Hopefully openings are up to date.  This page can give you a view into the organization's culture. \n\n* Louise says it's good to have a video of another employee speaking to the company's culture and benefits.  People want to see someone who looks like them (not just a CEO). \n\n* Young graduates want to hear about career progression, how companies look after the environment, etc.   \n\n* People with families may care more about work / life balance, wellness benefits, etc. \n\n* There are personas and target markets for Talent Marketing just like when you're trying to sell a product. \n\n* Louise's team also does LinkedIn Live events for VMware.  You can find a list of recorded videos [here](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vmware/videos/) including Career Meetups and sessions on The Joy of Innovation. \n\n* For the Careers Meetups specifically, Louise's team partners with other teams in the organization.  For example, there was one about the sales career path which featured 3 employees with different levels of seniority. \n\n* These events can give candidates an idea of how the recruitment process works for these types of roles.  There was an episode focused on working in [Talent Acquisition](https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6866409791359713280/?isInternal=true) that may be of interest. \n\n* If you follow the VMware company page on LinkedIn you can get a notification when an event goes live (no need to register, just watch).  There may be 500 - 600 people on one of these events (which are completely free and about 35 minutes).  The mission is to empower people who want to apply at VMware, including discussions about the hiring process and what to expect. \n\n* There are probably similar events out there sponsored by other companies. \n\n## 15:51 - Hiring Processes \n\n* Depending on the company at which you're applying you may not know the hiring process.  Some people have written blogs during the great resignation about their hiring process actually becoming longer. \n\n* If the process is going to be 5 rounds and you don't know it, you may not be mentally prepared to go through the process. \n\n* Louise says candidate experience is key and core to everything her team does. \n\n* VMware now has a hiring process called GO Hiring (GO = guided by outcomes).  There is a Career Meetup video on this that you can watch [here](https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6851544434618843136/?isInternal=true) if interested. \n\n* This new methodology was developed by Nate Anderson.  You can read more about it in [this blog post](https://blogs.vmware.com/careers/2021/09/go-hiring-innovating-vmwares-hiring-practices.html). \n\n* Louise found out she was one of the first few candidates on which this methodology was used when she interviewed in early 2021. \n\n* Hiring is done based on performance and not on pedigree.  The criteria for specific experience is not as strict (i.e. 10 years in a specific discipline). \n\n* Each interview stage is very practical and may involve some type of project the candidate has to complete at home.  Interviewers are given practical questions to look at the thought process behind a piece of work and how a candidate thinks. \n\n* The job description according to Louise was very different because of this methodology and includes what is expected in the first 30-60-90 days of getting a specific role.  Hiring managers have the option to add something about themselves into the job description. \n\n* There is feedback gathering from candidates after every interview and a net promoter score that is baked into the process. \n\n* Nate explains this to people by saying he wants someone to come up with a solution to cross a river.  Most people (99%) will say build a bridge.  But there are many ways across (swim, build a boat, walk across if it's shallow, etc.).  The presence of strict requirements ends up creating a search for bridge builders rather than really looking at how the person might do the work expected (i.e. just finding solutions to get across the water). \n\n* Nick suggests this might allow someone with experience in one area to showcase the relatable experience as helping them excel in a new area. \n\n* [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion principles](https://dei.extension.org/) are baked into this process as well.  [[Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion|DEI]]\n\n* Research shows that women are more inclined to apply for a job if they meet 100% of the criteria, whereas men will often apply if they meet 60-70%. \n\n## 21:35 - Early Career \n\n* In college Louise studied media, communications, and geography.  She also did some post graduate work in public relations and event management.   \n\n* She was an events assistant in Dublin, Ireland for a well-known restaurant during a period referred to as the [Celtic Tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Tiger). \n\n* She moved to the public sector during this time for a more sensible job. \n\n* In 2008 the Irish economy went into a severe recession.  At the time Louise was working for a government body called Pubble that managed government funding for community development projects. \n\n* It was a very uncertain time.  Louise was in her late 20s with no mortgage or kids.  The company started offering very attractive voluntary redundancy packages. \n\n* Louise opted to take a package and was paid a great deal of money to leave her job. \n\n* Louise decided to go to New Zealand. Irish people can get 1 year working holiday visas for visiting Australia or New Zealand. \n\n* Louise had some friends in New Zealand.  She got the 1 year visa but did not want to work in a bar or restaurant.  One of Louise's friends had a friend who studied [CELTA (Cambridge English Language Teaching to Adults)](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching-qualifications/celta/). \n\n* This was a very rigorous 1-month course that Louise decided to take.  This path seemed like the best opportunity to get a job at a nice school once complete. \n\n* Louise actually bought a one-way ticket to New Zealand.  She didn't know if she would be there for a month, several months, etc. \n\n* After arriving in New Zealand, Louise toured the country for a couple of months and then went to Auckland.  She stayed with two people she knew and handed out her resume to local schools.  Louise started teaching for a few hours here and there for a local Kaplan school over a period of 2 years before returning to Ireland. \n\n* Louise was renting an apartment in Dublin at the time, took most of her things to her parents' home, and departed with only 2 suitcases. \n\n* It was very freeing, almost like a tortoise that has a home on their back. \n\n## 26:35 - A Move to Teaching \n\n* Louise resisted teaching for quite a while.  She went to [Mary Immaculate College](https://www.mic.ul.ie/) to study communications as part of an arts degree, and the school was well known for having bachelor of education degrees for students to specialize in primary education. \n\n* About 90% of the students who did the arts course became teachers. \n\n* You can become a primary or secondary school teacher based on these programs, but Louise wanted to avoid these options.   \n\n* Louise did her post-graduate work in public relations and event management. \n\n* The feedback she had heard on the CELTA program was the flexibility of travel to anywhere and that it keeps you from having to work in a bar or a restaurant. \n\n* Louise got very nervous before starting this path and finally convinced herself to do it. \n\n* The irony is she loved the teaching and was quite good at it, teaching for 2 years in New Zealand and continuing to teach even after coming back to Ireland (in Cork, Dublin, and even offering private tutoring to students at times). \n\n## 28:51 - Relocation to Another Country \n\n* Louise suggests researching legal requirements for the country of choice. \n\n* Is there a working visa program like Louise found?  Find out what you are legally allowed to do. \n\n* Be patient.  You have to hustle.  Louise printed out 15-20 copies of her resume to hand out to local schools and went knocking doors when she was looking for a job in New Zealand. \n\n* Think about what online recruitment boards are popular in the area.  Is it Monster or something else entirely? \n\n* Can you register with some recruiters? \n\n* What are the transferrable skills from your country that will work for you and be recognized in a different country? \n\n* For example, Louise was able to stand out with high grades from her completion of the CELTA program. \n\n* Did Louise always want to travel? \n\n* Louise was part of a college exchange in her 3rd year and came to Houston, TX to study at the University of St. Thomas for 6 months.  That was her first time so far away from home and being immersed in another culture. \n\n* When she was younger, her parents took her to France and to drive around Europe.  They might have jumped on a plane to visit Spain for a week, for example, and were very lucky. \n\n* This reminds Nick of Ashley Connell telling her manager she wanted to travel abroad one day in [Episode 96](https://nerd-journey.com/sponsorship-dreams-and-the-path-to-entrepreneurship-with-ashley-connell/) and it eventually becoming a reality.   \n\n* In Louise's case, Ireland and New Zealand are about as far apart as you can get. \n\n## 32:25 - Boomerang Back to Ireland \n\n* When you're away it's a bit transient unless you put down mega roots.  Louise always knew it was never to be a long term thing to be in New Zealand. \n\n* Louise also volunteered as a media assistant for the [Rugby World Cup](https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/) in Auckland, which is the 3rd largest sporting event of the year. This was part of the reason she stayed for the second year. \n\n* It took a year from the time she applied online until she was selected to be a media assistant. \n\n* She and the rest of the team supported about 300 journalists and 250 photo journalists in the media center and conference rooms at the event. \n\n* This experience really ignited Louise's desire to return to work in public relations. \n\n* She was ready for the next chapter and to go back home to Ireland.  \n\n* Louise thought she would be able to get a top notch job in public relations, but around the same time digital marketing had exploded. \n\n* Upon returning, there were a number of people Louise went to school with furthering their public relations careers by going back to school to study digital marketing. \n\n* Louise didn't have this kind of education.  She didn't know how to use Facebook for business purposes or how to run Twitter campaigns (the feedback she kept getting). \n\n* She had to go back to college and was lucky to get a free post-graduate course in digital marketing courtesy of the government. \n\n* It was hard to work for the Rugby World Cup in Auckland and not become a bigger rugby fan (which Louise was already before moving there for a time). \n\n* Being in the media center for this event was pretty easy and mostly involved handing out wireless access codes and running around to hand out copies of lineup changes. \n\n* The conference rooms had translator devices that non-native English speakers could use to follow along with the rugby action. \n\n## 37:50 - A Love for Digital Marketing \n\n* Louise and digital marketing were like two peas in a pod.  She loved it.  It appealed to both sides of her brain, the logical side and the creative side. \n\n* She learned how to use Google Analytics, which she still uses today.  She also learned about SEO (search engine optimization) and had to create and maintain blogs as part of her coursework. \n\n* There were presentations from a number of industry experts during her coursework in digital marketing. \n\n* Blogging was pretty new to Louise, but from her public relations experience she would have been quite comfortable writing press releases. \n\n* The keywords, formatting, and SEO aspects of blogging were new to Louise. \n\n* After the teaching in New Zealand Louise's grammar has greatly improved.  Her creative writing has also helped Louise become a better editor.  \n\n* Combining all of these things and wrapping the marketing aspect into it makes blogging one of Louise's favorite things to do now. \n\n## 39:53 - Advice for Bettering Your Writing \n\n* One of the pieces of advice Louise received as a student in creative writing workshops was read more to become a better writer. \n\n* For the aspiring blogger, do your research. \n\n* Don't forget to look past the first page of Google results (most people don't).   \n\n* Check out your competitors are and what they are writing.  Consider the following: \n\n* What do you like?   \n\n* What don't you like, and why not?  Ask yourself why the content in someone else's blog may not be engaging. Keep a copy of their posts to give it some thought. \n\n* You'll need to find your own tone.  Why are your writing the blog in the first place?  What do you want someone to get out of it? \n\n* Is the piece a thought or opinion piece? \n\n* What do you want the reader to gain from reading your work? \n\n* Does Louise's training in communications make her a perfectionist when it comes to writing? \n\n* Perfectionism used to be a problem, but when Lousie started working for herself, she had to adopt the mantra that good enough is good enough.  There are only so many hours in a day. \n\n* In her current role at VMware, when reviewing someone's blog, it's up to Louise to ensure that the best piece of work goes out for the writer because their name is on it. \n\n* Louise is a bit more comfortable now with the process and knows what a good piece looks like, trying not to be overly critical.  \n\n* \"At the end of the day it's the content and the author's tone that has to come across.\" - Louise Bunyan \n\n* Louise rolled out a training program to help educate people that want to write a piece for the VMware careers blog.  She tells people that good enough is good enough.  Louise tries to make things as easy as possible for potential content creators. \n\n* Sometimes Louise will have an idea for a piece and just make bullet points.  She likes to get all her thoughts down on a page and then go back and edit later. \n\n* Brene Brown has a phrase about terrible first drafts.  Your first draft is just to get your thoughts in order (not something you would want to publish). \n\n* When working with others, Louise encourages writers to send her their thoughts and let her cast an eye on it to provide suggestions (i.e. if they are writing a thought piece). \n\n* For the first time blogger, consider doing a top 3 / top 5 post as an easy way to get started. \n\n* How-to articles are also very popular with people who have visited the VMware Careers blog. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-163":{"title":"Episode 163","content":"\n# Episode 163\n\nWelcome to episode 163 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

A Bartering Agreement \n\n* [Louise Bunyan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisebunyan/) is a Talent Marketing Specialist with VMware (joined January 2021).  She is part of the Employment Brand team and works remotely in County Cork in Ireland. \n\n* Louise also owns a side business called [SmartFox](https://www.smartfox.ie/) since 2017 specializing in LinkedIn training for job seekers and students as well as sales and business development professionals. \n\n* We heard last week that Louise was in New Zealand for 2 years teaching English to international students. \n\n* After returning to Ireland Louise started applying to various jobs but kept getting told no. \n\n* Many people Louise knew had gone back to school to study digital marketing because of its popularity in Ireland. \n\n* Louise applied at a local university and got into a 5-month course on digital marketing, covering a variety of things like Google Analytics, Google Ads, writing your own blog, etc.   \n\n* Louise loved it.  Some of the course was masters level lectures in consumer behavior, market research, and other psychological aspects. \n\n* While taking the course she would go horse riding for fun. \n\n* The guy who ran the stable had an awful website (avocado green). \n\n* Louise let him know she was taking a course.  She offered to improve his website and help him develop a presence on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.  Louise asked that for every hour she spent on this to get free horse riding lessons. \n\n* He wanted to see what Louise could do first and was initially skeptical. \n\n* He referred to Louise as a diamond in the rough after seeing her work.  She ended up exceeding both his and even her own expectations in the process. \n\n* Louise loved the work and redid his website, infusing SEO (search engine optimization) along the way.  She also created a YouTube channel and took videos, becoming a content producer before even knowing what those words meant. \n\n* Louise began to notice new clients and new families visiting the stable.  Several people bought horses and paid the stable owner for [livery](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/livery%20stable). \n\n* Parents started buying their kids ponies, and the owner had to build 8 new stables to house all of this. \n\n* This was the first time Louise was able to see something end-to-end (Google search to becoming a customer and seeing the results of business growth).  She created a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page for the website. \n\n* Louise realized just how powerful marketing could be. \n\n## 9:18 - Interviews, Negotiation, and Initiative \n\n* Upon finishing the course, she saw a job for an online marketing executive with a global recruitment agency based in Cork. \n\n* Interviewers told her after getting the job that what they really liked was the bartering with the horse stables and being able to show how she contributed to that business making money, generating leads, and getting customers. \n\n* No one told Louise to do it, but she had tracked metrics that showed progress of her work, starting with an Excel file that showed where things began.  Website visits and inquiries coming in from the website were quite low. \n\n* Louise kept track of the changes to these metrics over periods of 3, 6, 9 months and was surprised to see the growth. \n\n* Louise had asked the owner of the stable if she could list the works she did for him on her resume as a job, and he said absolutely.  He also acted as a reference for her. \n\n* When Louise brought up this experience in interviews, the interviewers found it very interesting.  They understood Louise could negotiate with others and had a great deal of initiative. \n\n* Any time Louise brought this up in future interviews in the next several years, negotiation and initiative were referenced by interviewers as skills she had proven, and it was a total game changer for her. \n\n* If you've done something you are really passionate about, put it on your resume (i.e. turn it into a job), and see what you can get back out of it (especially if you can add metrics to show impact like year over year customer growth, etc.). \n\n* This is also a lesson in documenting your work.  Not only did Louise do the work, she documented the work and its progress / impact.  This has potential to hit an interviewer out of nowhere with complete surprise (in a good way). \n\n* In digital marketing, you need to know how to use a number of tools.  It's one thing to know how to use the tools but another to use them properly to generate revenue, for example.  It serves as proof of work. \n\n* Continued education in fields where we use technology combined with proof of work is key to everyone's continued upward career trajectory \n\n* In conducting LinkedIn training Louise has worked with some job seekers that might not have a degree.  But even with a degree, Louise still has to train on the tools she uses to learn about new features and sharpen skills. \n\n* You will never know it all.  Things develop and move quickly.  \n\n## 15:57 - Training and Gaining Experience \n\n* Part of the work Louise does at VMware is training and enablement.  It's vitally important for recruiters and sourcers to be stay up to date on tools.   \n\n* When there is a new feature, her team has set a target that her team would be trained within 3 weeks. These folks will then train the sourcers and recruiters on the new features. \n\n* It seems like coursework, proof of work, and experience will trump a degree with no experience.  For so many jobs there is not a clean degree for it. \n\n* Perhaps the foundations are shaking in this area. \n\n* It's kind of a catch 22.  You have a degree, but for a graduate it is trying to get an employer to give you a chance. \n\n* Getting that hands on work experience is a big win and difference maker.  But trying to crack that ceiling can be very frustrating. \n\n* Louise knows that pain.  There is nothing stopping you from freelancing or from reaching out and suggesting someone take you on as a contractor for a few weeks or some other length of time.   \n\n* If it doesn't work out you remain friends and walk away.  It's a very lucrative option for any employer. \n\n* This reminds Nick of the managers we've had on the show who expose some of the manager responsibilities to direct reports, allowing the person to gain some experience. \n\n## 20:23 - Recruitment Marketing, Developers, and Scrum \n\n* Getting the job with the recruitment agency was Louise's foray into recruitment marketing.  She started as an online marketing executive and even covered for her manager that went on maternity leave (7 months). \n\n* At this point Louise was promoted to online marketing specialist. \n\n* She got to see the full scope of online recruitment marketing, working with multiple tools that needed to integrate together like job boards. \n\n* This covered things like how jobs are posted, how resumes get handled when they are submitted, how the resumes get put into the database / how they get to the recruiter's inbox, managing communications, how to track candidates that got the job they applied for, etc. \n\n* Louise had to learn how to talk to developers, acting as a go between from business leaders like the CEO of a branch down to them. \n\n* She learned to ask questions about the business need for something and the metrics the company would use to track it (which often times made the idea of implementing something a competitor had just because someone thought they should do it fall apart). \n\n* Things like time and workload management and general business etiquette were quite new to Louise at this time. \n\n* Louise's brother advised her to bring a prop to meetings (a notebook and a pen). \n\n* Louise began to manage the ticket queue for issues with the website and began to use SCRUM. \n\n* She attended a 2-day workshop on SCRUM and came back as a mini-expert. \n\n* Check out [Episode 132](https://nerd-journey.com/riding-the-burnout-wave-with-jonathan-frappier-2-2/) with [[Jonathan Frappier]] for his thoughts on using this methodology. [[Episode 132]] \n\n* John associates SCRUM with more of a project management tool for software, but it is a general product and project management technique. \n\n* Louise was part of the web team, and they had a team of developers with which they worked. \n\n* She and her team worked to capture and prioritize issues based on business needs, determining which were realistic to solve. \n\n* They used Jira as a tool to help prioritize, worked in sprints, and was a very organized process that Louise loved. \n\n* It was a great process to be able to manage work in a transparent way. \n\n* Louise also learned [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) as part of this experience. \n\n* Louise was someone who understood the dependency chain based on what people might want in one of these tickets. \n\n* She said they would refer to themselves as translators.  The operations side of the business (high volume sales and recruitment) was not an easy place to be and is very reactive and intense. \n\n* Someone needed to translate to developers, who speak a completely different kind of language, and also in the other direction to nontechnical folks (i.e. how long it might take to add features people wanted and maybe find a minimum viable product as a compromise). \n\n* John shares a good comparison of waterfall delivery versus an iterative delivery based on a minimum viable product and feedback loops. \n\n* The high volume operational environment was demanding in that everyone wants results quickly. \n\n## 28:26 - Blogging Revisited \n\n* Louise started a blogging program at the recruitment firm (probably her favorite project). \n\n* Before joining the online team, that team had decided they were going to go after website content / blogging content in a big way. \n\n* Only about 6% of people are looking to change jobs.  They might be searching for digital marketing openings, for example. \n\n* People might be searching for practical tips on how to negotiate a salary increase, resume tips, etc.  \n\n* The recruiters at Louise's company had a task to create certain blogs on a monthly basis. \n\n* Because of Louise's experience teaching in New Zealand, she did a train the trainer course and seemed like a perfect project. \n\n* This was around the time Louise got into creative writing.  While in New Zealand she had created a writing module for her students.  \n\n* Recruiters couldn't be taken away from their duties for more than an hour, which meant Louise had to teach them blogging for beginners in 50 minutes. \n\n* Her course touched on the reasons why recruiters needed to blog and the benefit to them as well as SEO (search engine optimization).   \n\n* Louise loved it, rolling it out in Ireland and then to London.  She trained marketing executives in various offices who then trained the recruiters. \n\n* The volume of content produced went up, website visits went up, number of resumes went up…everything just went up as a result. \n\n* John thinks it was an interesting approach to spread the task of writing across a team rather than have it be one person's uplift. \n\n## 31:46 - A Deeper Dive on SEO \n\n* Louise is the 3rd person we've spoken with lately who has mentioned SEO as a component of content development. \n\n* Check out [Episode 157](https://nerd-journey.com/take-note-of-your-time-with-josh-duffney-2-2/) with [[Josh Duffney]] and [Episode 159](https://nerd-journey.com/in-pursuit-of-a-new-path-with-andy-syrewicze-2-3/) with [[Andy Syrewicze]] for mentions of this lately. [[Episode 157]] [[Episode 159]]\n\n* John has interacted with some basic SEO plugins in Wordpress, but that is about it. \n\n* Louise is a words person, so it comes down to words.  She's a marketer, so it comes down to people also - user behavior, what people need to know, etc. \n\n* What questions are people putting into search engines? \n\n* What information are they looking for? \n\n* Suppose you want to find inexpensive flights to Greece.  What should you type into a web search? \n\n* John says \"cheap flights Greece.\" \n\n* Why not make those part of a blog title since that is what people are searching for?  This is part of meeting people where they are. \n\n* You need the things people are looking for on your website.  Google will help you. \n\n* One of Louise's favorite tools is [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) (formerly Google Webmaster Tools). \n\n* When hooked up to your website, this tool allows you to download the top 1000 search queries people put in and use for your site. \n\n* The list allows you to see number of clicks per query to see ranking, number of impressions (number of times it has appeared in Google search results), a click through rate, and then position. \n\n* Downloading the search queries is a great way to see what you're appearing highly for, what is low searched, visualization of the really good keywords that represent your brand, etc. \n\n* Louise likes to color code phrases and keywords based on the results. \n\n* Once you have these results you start to go to work on your site, looking at meta titles, meta tags, etc. to see if they would be click worthy. \n\n* You can drive up the occurrence of certain words on your site, but it has to be quality. \n\n## 38:03 - The Genesis of SmartFox \n\n* At one point Louise was made redundant and could not get a job.  She started freelancing. \n\n* A training company got in touch and mentioned she had done a lot with LinkedIn and digital marketing.  They asked if she would want to be one of their trainers. \n\n* Louise agreed to work for them (despite a little impostor syndrome).  One of the first trainings was a full day LinkedIn training.  She found out she was doing it 2 weeks before it took place. \n\n* Louise thought she would get a slide deck and some other materials.  She ended up getting 4 slides total (one was the title slide) and an attendance form.  She had to create an entire day's worth of content. \n\n* Louise ended up with over 90 slides in total, but since she created the content, it was hers and not the company's content. \n\n* She was able to use later use this as branding for [SmartFox](https://www.smartfox.ie/). \n\n* Louise continued to do work for the training company (who where highly rated in search engines).  The content Louise delivered was well received and also in high demand. \n\n* She did some work on the SmartFox website but wasn't getting gigs.  The majority of her work came through the training company. \n\n* Louise found out she was not getting paid near as much as the training company was for what she delivered.  She asked for a raise of her rate, and they told her if she wanted they could just end her contract right then.  She continued to work for them but was pretty upset. \n\n* Louise started asking the people who took her training classes how they found out about the training company.  People told her it was through a Google search. \n\n* Knowing she knew how to leverage SEO to change things, Louise spent a weekend writing a series of 4 blogs and re-branding her own side to highlight LinkedIn training. \n\n* Slowly but surely her site began to climb the rankings, eventually bypassing the training company in search rankings.  Then she started to get more phone calls about training opportunities directly. \n\n* Louise stopped working with the training company.  Their LinkedIn business dried up.  She had carved up a huge reputation for herself through work on her site and through building her network through speaking at events and conferences. \n\n* You have to do all the things.  It's not just the website stuff. \n\n* A couple of years ago Louise realized she needed to write more how-to content, especially around the time the pandemic hit and the #opentowork hashtag became popular. \n\n* Louise was getting questions about this, and her brain immediately started wondering what people might be searching for around this topic.  She wrote a [very extensive blog on the topic](https://www.smartfox.ie/linkedin-blog/how-to-get-opentowork-on-your-linkedin). \n\n* That article was getting thousands of hits per month, and she wanted to see if another page was referring to it from elsewhere (i.e. a big brand).   \n\n* When doing a Google search for LinkedIn #opentowork her blog had an entire section up at the top above any search results. \n\n* She tried this in an incognito tab on multiple computers to make sure it was the same search results. \n\n* Blogging is powerful, and for Louise it is search engine optimization. \n\n* It's not about Wordpress plugins.  It's about having the awareness and the knowledge to know \"this is a frequently asked question\" and \"this is a problem people have on scale.\"  Combine that with knowing what people will type into Google to search for the information, and then you can focus on improving the quality of your answer. \n\n* It may take time, but the traffic will come. \n\n* When something is high enough quality, Google can start referring to something you've written as a canonical answer (which in Louise's case was more helpful than even content than that developed by LinkedIn). \n\n* It's not about stuffing search terms into metadata.  It's about quality of content. \n\n* Louise says people are at the heart of that blog.  It's for helping job seekers. \n\n* Louise thought to herself - \"If I wanted to know all about this tool (what it is, how to turn it on, what impact it has, and how I turn it off), where would I go to learn how to do that?\" \n\n* Her content was published right around the time the pandemic hit and really resonated with people. \n\n* On the other side of the [[Great Resignation]], this is still relevant. \n\n* People consistently want to know about privacy on LinkedIn and if something will appear on the newsfeed as well as if their employer will know. \n\n* There's a great link between learning, writing, and curiosity here to consider. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-164":{"title":"Episode 164","content":"\n# Episode 164\n\nWelcome to episode 164 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

Being Made Redundant \n\n* Louise moved on from the recruitment agency and got a job at a scaling tech startup in Cork as a full time content writer.  It was Louise and only a couple of other people when she was hired (very new team). \n\n* Not long after joining, she got the feeling the startup was not for her. \n\n* The company was scaling massively, going from 40 employees to about 70 in just a couple of months. \n\n* Louise and her team won an award for best marketing blog in Ireland in 2016. \n\n* Louise felt something was coming (a gut feeling).  There was a new director from New York who was making sweeping changes. \n\n* On a particular morning in October, Louise noticed some very senior people would not look her in the eye.  They must have known what was coming. \n\n* At about 3 PM there was a message from the CEO to come to a specific room. \n\n* When they walked in, they were told the company was outsourcing the blog to a company in New York, and the team was being made redundant (laid off / let go), effective immediately.  They had about 20-30 minutes to pack up their desks and say goodbye. \n\n* Louise was partly relieved.  It felt like a get out of jail card.  She could start interviewing. \n\n* She understood that there was nothing she had done to mess  \n\nup.  The jobs of her team were legitimately being outsourced to a company in New York. \n\n* Louise and a colleague were still in shock at getting the news.  But Louise realized her resume was only 8 months old (had been with the startup that long).  She added the blogging award and began interviewing. \n\n* The interview process after this was grueling.  It ground her down and burned her out.  She interviewed for 5 months, receiving only rejections. \n\n* She was scratching her head.  Job descriptions were not accurate.  She would see digital marketing manager as the title but kept getting hammered about being an expert in Facebook ad campaigns. \n\n* Louise started writing down everything she remembered from interviews and kept it in a spreadsheet.  After a couple of months she read back over it and saw Facebook come up again and again. \n\n* Louise knew she was not going to be able to change companies putting the wrong titles on job postings.  She could control closing the gap in skillset, however, and started freelancing. \n\n* Louise worked with a couple of clients and ran Facebook ads.  In her earlier years, another team (consultant, outsourcer) had run the Facebook stuff.  She had no direct experience similar to what we discussed with new graduates earlier in the interview. \n\n* Louise had to go back and take a few courses on Facebook ad campaigns and then get some experience.  That's all it really was keeping her from getting people to say yes to hiring her. \n\n* Around the time Louise took on this task she got some mentoring too from one of Ireland's leading experts in eCommerce.  That person encouraged her to put down that she was Ireland's leading expert in LinkedIn training.  Her mentor encouraged her to go and own that space (which Louise did). \n\n## 8:44 - A Passion for the Candidate \n\n* Louise is quite passionate about the candidate experience in the hiring process and will fight for the candidate.  Likely this comes from her horrible experience in interviewing during that 5 month period. \n\n* Louise wrote a couple of blogs and shared the terrible experiences she had as an interviewee. \n\n* She started writing about talent personas and became passionate about employer branding. \n\n* She then started working with some companies on their employer branding. \n\n* Then Louise saw the job at VMware.  While reading the description, for the first time she thought \"this is me.\"  It wanted a trainer, a copy writer, a words person, someone passionate about employee branding and the candidate experience, based in Ireland, etc. \n\n* She got the job, and she's still with VMware over a year later. \n\n* John makes the point that so many of the companies Louise had interviewed with left out the critical skill that ruled a candidate in or out from the job description.  Those companies were being inefficient in bringing in the wrong candidates.  Hopefully employers can learn a lesson in writing better job descriptions by hearing the contrast in Louise's experiences in interviewing as we've detailed in the show. \n\n* The aggregation of Louise's experiences are what made her a great candidate for a role in talent marketing. \n\n* Interestingly enough, the startup that outsourced their marketing and made people redundant eventually switched back to insourcing talent from Cork. \n\n* Louise felt things changed this time around because she had her own business.  The main reason for going back to work for an employer was her mortgage. \n\n* Banks had given Louise feedback on needing to see consistent income each month.  The only way she would hit that goal with her company would be to go international and hire a team of people (which she did not want to do).   \n\n* The role at VMware was a contract position, which was attractive to Louise and allowed her to dip a toe into the water so to speak and get used to being an employee again. \n\n* In addition to this being a new role within the company, one of the interviews had told Louise they were looking for a startup mindset (which fit her entrepreneurial talents). \n\n* The job description was written in the new [Go Hiring](https://blogs.vmware.com/careers/2021/09/go-hiring-innovating-vmwares-hiring-practices.html) format which emphasizes performance over pedigree. \n\n## 15:06 - Current State of SmartFox \n\n* Louise has scaled this back to a mini side gig lately and will do the occasional webinar in the evenings.   \n\n* She remains a well recognized speaker and also has partnerships with some student groups (2 Women in STEM groups in Cork). \n\n* Louise enjoys demystifying LinkedIn for students and getting them off to a good start.  She is excited to see the students grow and change roles over time. \n\n* Louise has her own online school, which she perhaps does not promote as much as she should.  Check out the [SmartFox School and its courses](https://smartfoxtraining.com/). \n\n* People seem to like the self-paced course format. \n\n* Keeping her side business acts as a security blanket, especially after the previous experience of being made redundant (and the financial / emotional / spiritual impacts of something like that). \n\n## 17:37 - Great Resignation \n\n* John is doing a one person rebrand of the great resignation and is calling it the great upgrade.  He feels people are not quitting their jobs and doing nothing but rather realizing there are better jobs out there. \n\n* Remote work has opened up the market and allowed people to do other things. \n\n* Employers are realizing people are no longer desperate to work and perhaps spinning it as an unwillingness to work. \n\n* Louise has heard this called the great revolution. \n\n* In fact, she put a poll on her LinkedIn page asking if the great resignation was just in the US or applied to Ireland as well. \n\n* About 70% of recruiters Louise is connected to said the great resignation does apply to Ireland. \n\n* Louise was speaking to a colleague in India who was unfamiliar with the great resignation. \n\n* Louise thinks the great resignation may be more of a US phenomenon. \n\n* John considers writing a blog post on use of the great resignation in English speaking countries.   \n\n## 22:57 - Women in STEM and LinkedIn Optimization \n\n* Louise started working with two women in STEM groups at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/) and [Munster Technological University](https://www.mtu.ie/).  STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. \n\n* The original request came from one of the universities' societies for women in STEM.  They had reached out to her after doing a Google search looking for LinkedIn training. \n\n* The society was sponsored by a local pharmaceutical company and was able to pay Louise for the work (her normal LinkedIn 50 minute bootcamp). \n\n* She delivered the training at a lecture hall.  After her talk, the society had invited the photography society in to take professional headshots for them. \n\n* Louise has connected with a number of these ladies and had the opportunity to see them progress.  She even ran into a group of them at a restaurant in Cork at one point after doing the class. \n\n* Louise received such good feedback from the group on her course that she now does this for them every year. \n\n* As for the second university she started working with, they had organized a one day prepare yourself for an interview workshop with a number of sessions.  Louise was invited to come give her talk on LinkedIn for job seekers. \n\n* She showed the group some LinkedIn headlines.  She knew there were some software engineers in the group and wanted to show them creative headline usage.  But it took her a while to find examples of folks who had something more than just software engineer. \n\n* She told the group that the headline was a way to market themselves, even if they put in a few extra words in addition to software engineer it could really get the attention of recruiters and talent acquisition folks.  People didn't know what words to use to make themselves differentiated, so Louise helped them brainstorm ideas.  Now she encourages people in her trainings to really think outside the box with their headline. \n\n* Louise hopes to continue the work with these groups each year for as long as she can. \n\n* The headline is your elevator pitch (a lesson for all of us).  It influences hearts and minds and impacts people while having a huge impact on search engine optimization. \n\n* For job seekers, it's ideal to appear on page 1 when someone is searching.  This additional data in your headline influences both the LinkedIn search bot and overall Google search. \n\n* John has seen headlines where people have written a sentence about themselves, but it doesn't really tell you anything. \n\n* Louise says there is a big difference between your headline (just below your picture) and your job title (further down the page).  Think of the headline like a newspaper headline. \n\n* Louise mentioned the headline does have a character count. Instead of using the word \"and\" she uses ampersand (\u0026) instead as well as the pipe symbol (|) to divide keywords. \n\n* Your headline and your job title are two of the most powerful search engine elements.  Louise works with job seekers on these two items often as it can catch the eye of recruiters and talent acquisition specialists. \n\n* Taking [John's LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vjourneyman/) as an example, his headline (at the time of this recording) is his title (Customer Engineer at Google).  Maybe he should change it to Customer Engineer | Pre-Sales Technical Engineer at Google Cloud | Co-host of Nerd Journey Podcast. \n\n* When Louise started SmartFox, she was a Director and added this to her job title.  She also added things like LinkedIn Trainer, LinkedIn Training Specialist, but was not highly ranked in search results. \n\n* She asked herself \"what do the people on page 1 of the search results have that I don't have?\"  The people at the top of results had LinkedIn in their headline, job title, the about section, basically everywhere.  Adding Director wasn't the greatest move. \n\n* Much like Louise had done with her website previously, she totally revamped her LinkedIn page.  She was then coming up second in search results for LinkedIn Trainer. \n\n* Louise loves search engine optimization because it is so easy to influence and manipulate once you have your formula.  It's all about words, and Louise loves words. \n\n* By doing the optimization, you are putting yourself in the top 1 percent because many others are not putting forth the effort. \n\n* You probably need to have more quality work that you link to on your LinkedIn page (i.e. blog posts you've written) or evidence that a big site referenced your article. \n\n* It's one thing to rank highly as a LinkedIn trainer, but in a different space (global airlines, large industries that have search engine optimization specialists) it may be extremely difficult to get to the top of the search results.   \n\n* Maybe we need to get someone who is highly technical and works specifically on search engine optimization on the show?  Tweet at us and let us know what you think! \n\n## 38:01 - Parting Thoughts and Quick Tips \n\n* We're trying to reach people who want to upskill and progress in their career.  Writing, quality content, understanding what people are looking for, understanding the rule in skill being asked for in a job domain and getting training for it, and seeing the results. \n\n* For the job seeker / job changer, Louise learned about the power of her network.  Don't underestimate the power of yours! \n\n* In Cork, certain job referrals and recommendations come through your professional network. \n\n* When she was made redundant she did not know any other marketers in the area due to being so focused inside her employer. \n\n* At the time she joined a women in business networking group.  It was her first time networking, and she was very nervous.   \n\n* She went to weekly events with the group and met the graphic designer that eventually designed the logo for SmartFox.  Louise had no money, so they bartered.  Each would spend an hour helping the other (Louise helping in digital marketing and Paula, the graphic designer, helping with design).  As Louise got more business, people really loved her branding, and she was able to bring business to Paula as well.  They paired up on a number of projects. \n\n* How do you network in a remote world? \n\n* Louise suggests attending LinkedIn Live events, asking questions, and maybe connecting with the speaker or the organizer afterward. \n\n* If you have an interview, you can easily look them up on LinkedIn and possibly connect with them. \n\n* Find where your tribe hangs out, and go there (networking groups for IT, for engineers, etc.). \n\n* If you go to a physical event, don't stand in the corner with your cup of tea or coffee.  People are there to talk and engage. \n\n* Don't forget some business cards to hand out at physical events, and connect with people on LinkedIn. \n\n* LinkedIn will get you found in searches.  Recruiters will reach out to you on LinkedIn.  Think of that like the top of the funnel. \n\n* Next in the process is your cv / resume, and then there is the interview. \n\n* In Louise's cases she was not great at interviewing.  When she thought about going back to an employer, she had PTSD from her previous experiences.  She ended up reaching out to her network and working with a good interviewer / coach for a couple of sessions (invaluable learnings from this). \n\n* When it came time to interview, Louise interviewed at 3 companies. \n\n* At the first company, she made it to the final 2 out of 100 applications but did not get the job.  She got some valuable feedback from them.  The candidate they chose had worked for the company previously and could hit the ground running (really the only reason Louise was not selected). \n\n* At the second company, there were about 150 applicants again.  Louise made it to the last two.  After the first interview she knew she did not want the job and knew additional interviews would be tough.  Because they were going to be tough, she knew she needed to do the interviews anyway.  She was very brazen and bold during the last few interviews, and the company liked that, offering her the job (which she declined, knowing she had a fallback with SmartFox). \n\n* At the time she was offered the job for company # 2, she was in her second interview with VMware and really felt that was the one for her.  In her third and fourth interviews with VMware she told them openly that she wanted the job and felt the spec was written for her. \n\n* Because Louise had worked for herself, learned to sell, and came up with ideas it helped her stand out.  She had confidence to say things like \"this is what I can do for you.\" \n\n* It's really tough when you go in for an interview.  Sometimes if you're getting ground down from being told no, try to find an interview coach (if you can).   \n\n* Work your network. \n\n* Optimize your profile. \n\n* There are so many things you can do that will add up to a greater shift in your luck. \n\n* If you need to do some freelancing or take a lower paying job to get out of grinding mode, that's fine too. \n\n* If there is something you can do to show an employer how passionate you are about a subject (blog, podcast, or other), it will make you stand out.  \n\n* if you're going to blog, you don't need to publish weekly.  Make a portfolio site.  You need something that gives you that touch of gold dust and sparkle.  \n\n* We look forward to finding some interesting topics to collaborate on with Louise in the future!  \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-165":{"title":"Episode 165","content":"\n# Episode 165\n\nWelcome to episode 165 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of an interview with Andrew Miller, discussing his progression from IT help desk as a customer to working as a pre-sales engineer for a partner, how having a side gig helped him progress, and how the way we present ourselves can make a huge impact on everyone around us. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 02-10-2022 \n\nTopics – Meet Andrew Miller, Transition to Help Desk, A Chance to Level Up; Writing, Communication, and Presenting Yourself; Picking up and Putting down a Side Gig, Motivated by the Right Things  [[Andrew Miller]] #PureStorage\n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:05 - Meet Andrew Miller \n\n* [Andrew Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriven/) is a #Principal Technologist within the Office of the CTO at Pure Storage.  Follow him on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/andriven). \n\n* Andrew knows a number of our pasts guests from his time in the tech industry.  He also mentions his love for the content discussed in past episodes of [The Geek Whisperers] podcast. \n\n* A little inside baseball… \n\n* John's wife created the intro and outro music and transition sound bits. \n\n* Nick's wife created the Nerd Journey logo.  Can you guess which two city skylines are merged in the Nerd Journey logo? \n\n* Andrew has been a musician all his life because his mom never gave any of the kids a choice. \n\n* Andrew used Macs from a very young age and got onto the yearbook staff.  He was able to take the designs of his high school peers and digitize them on a computer.  These skills later landed him his first IT Help Desk job in college and then later into IT operations. \n\n* Back in these days you measured the layout designs in pykas instead of inches or centimeters. \n\n## 5:45 - Transition to Help Desk \n\n* Andrew's dad had a Macintosh computer.  At one point his dad brought home DOS, but it was too hard. Andrew started tinkering.   \n\n* Once he got into yearbook staff in high school he was maintaining the Mac computers they used.   \n\n* The help desk technician realized he didn't have to do maintenance on the computers for the yearbook staff and basically left Andrew alone to take care of it. \n\n* This was at a school linked to a university.  During Andrew's sophomore year in college there was an opening with the help desk team.   \n\n* The team knew of Andrew to some extent because of his previous work for the yearbook staff.  He got the job and ended up working 20 - 25 hours per week while carrying a full load of his college course work.   \n\n* Andrew worked for multiple bosses during his time working for the college.  One of them recognized his specialty with Mac machines and worked to clear roadblocks for Andrew. \n\n* This person later hired Andrew for a Junior IT Operations role after college.  Andrew had shown he had the ability to learn. \n\n* There was an element of building, fixing, and creating to Andrew's work (which he very much enjoyed). \n\n## 8:36 - A Chance to Level Up \n\n* Andrew was given a chance by a manager who knew him well to level up to the IT Operations role (even if he may not have seemed qualified on paper).   \n\n* We might refer to this as brand exposure.  Andrew mentions how someone sees you on any given day may be the only impression they ever have of you. \n\n* Keep in mind we all have bad days, but keeping the above in mind gives you some perspective. \n\n* Maybe we get complacent at times and don't appreciate the work we get to do. \n\n* If we're in this industry (technology) we are extremely blessed and that our issues are normally first world problems. \n\n* John refers to this as the gout problem.  We should think back to where we came from and practice some moderation.  We're here doing this podcast shining the light backward for the benefit of others. \n\n* This job turned into a 7 year stint for Andrew.   \n\n* He started by running the backups using BackupExec.  The shop was small enough to allow someone to delve into networking, virtualization, security, and several other areas. \n\n* We have a fun time of reflection on Tivoli Storage Manager (another product Andrew got to know well).  Nick makes the point that fixing the snowflakes in an environment like where Andrew worked make you a better systems troubleshooter and are where the true learnings happen that allow you to step up to that next level. \n\n* For a while Andrew wondered if at some point he might go for a Master's degree.  He is the least educated in his family and stopped at a Bachelor's degree.  Looking back on this time, the 7-year period was like a post-graduate degree for Andrew which laid a foundation for what he did later in his career. \n\n* John cites the work equivalent of doing an advanced degree is somewhat comparable to an architectural certification from a technology vendor.  One big difference is the publishing of a thesis (i.e. the writing requirement).  It seems like an advanced degree requires more writing than experience in IT Operations may demand we do. \n\n* You can get by at a smaller shop without writing good documentation, but it requires keeping people around and not turning over (to protect institutional knowledge). \n\n* Andrew shares a story of a manager back in his help desk days who wanted everything heavily documented in a ticketing system.  Andrew was one of two Mac technicians. \n\n* Andrew started documenting things in tickets but never received feedback from his manager (even when he would put interesting notes in tickets to see if his boss was reading them). \n\n* He later found out the help desk team was using this system that was not backed up by IT Operations.  When the ticketing system crashed one day, all the information inside it was lost. \n\n## 17:27 - Writing, Communication, and Presenting Yourself \n\n* In college Andrew was a humanities major, which was due to Andrew having too many / so many interests.   \n\n* English classes involved a lot of writing.  This gave him some experience he didn't get while working in IT Operations and was helpful down the road when he started blogging. \n\n* Andrew was also on the speech and debate team in high school (called National Forensics League), gaining a great deal of experience in Lincoln-Douglas debate and extemporaneous speaking. \n\n* Andrew has thought about the building of these soft skills with his kids now.  After getting the hard skill foundation in his early career, these softer skills are what set him apart down the road. \n\n* John agrees helping kids set the foundation through debate and extemporaneous speaking is wise, participating in these activities in California in his youth (national extemporaneous speaking and Lincoln-Douglas debate). \n\n* John wishes he had done expository speaking which often involved making a poster and explaining a process.  Delivering a PowerPoint slide deck mirrors expository speaking. \n\n* There's almost nothing else John can point to from high school and say \"I do that every single day.\" \n\n* For people who have not had this experience, Andrew has regularly recommended [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/), participation in church Sunday school classes, or other low risk ways to gain this type of experience. \n\n* In Andrew's current role he primarily talks for a living. \n\n* Nick cites other low risk ways to gain experience through presentations - at a community event like a [VMware User Group (VMUG)](https://www.vmug.com/) meeting, a [SpiceCorps](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps) meeting, a [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/) group meeting, etc. \n\n* You don't need to have the presentation written to submit an abstract for a talk.  Wait until the talk is accepted to write the presentation. \n\n* Andrew says come up with a catchy title and a catchy presentation you believe you can deliver. \n\n* Andrew submitted an abstract for a [VMUG UserCon](https://www.vmug.com/events/usercons/) once that was not accepted.  Then at the last minute (day before) someone reached out asking if he could present in place of a speaker who was not able to attend.  Andrew said yes and wrote the presentation that night (which was painful) to deliver at the UserCon the next day.   \n\n* This was the first iteration of a very successful talk of his called [The Golden Hammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZBkRUi-1rs), which had to do with mental models and how we learn. \n\n* Some would say \"opportunities are disguised as hard work\".  This is about leaning in, having fun, and taking some chances.  Listen to Andrew's story about setting up a speaker that played a catchy song at that same VMUG to get peoples' attention. \n\n* John makes the point that we should submit interesting abstracts for presentations so that if asked at the last minute to give the talk we are still interested. \n\n* Luck is hard work + opportunity. \n\n* Sketch out some content, submit an abstract, and keep trying. \n\n* Andrew shares a story of a sales rep he worked with during his years at Varrow (a partner).  The guy was kind of goofy, but he was consistently successful. \n\n* You can control the place where you are.  If you're at the right place over and over again, eventually you're going to be there at the right time. \n\n* John mentioned this is similar to the interview process (control what you can control).  You can control your level of output, the things you learn, how well you document things, etc. \n\n* Nick mentions there is an element of style in all of this from the way you present information to the way you write about it, etc.  The presentation will display your style, perhaps almost becoming part of your personal brand. \n\n* Andrew says there is some intentionality in your personal brand.  He chooses to be a glass half full person (being politically aware but not playing politics).  Navigate challenging situations without letting that affect who you are. \n\n* Andrew shares the story of his peer [JD Wallace](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdseattle/) meeting someone he admired and getting dismissed. \n\n* Make a choice in how you will present and convey yourself.  Hopefully there is a way to maintain who you are through it all. \n\n* John shares a story of Wayne Gretzky having a bad day when he was a kid.  His father pulled Wayne aside and said he could not have a bad day like that or be grumpy because someone came to see him.  Don't leave that person with that impression.   \n\n* The same goes for all of us when we are networking.  One bad impression of you may be seen as the totality of who you are. \n\n* Be centered enough with consistency and a solid foundation in your life that you can withstand twists and turns in your career without having them totally unsettle you.   \n\n* You can be a sounding board for others.  Ask people questions until you find something of interest, and then let them talk. \n\n* When you're interested in hearing someone's story and concern, they can sense it.  Value people, and have that be a real part of you. \n\n## 30:54 - Picking up and Putting down a Side Gig \n\n* In the early 2000s Andrew was working at a university (married with no kids) in an hourly role working 50-60 hours per week.  At some point there was a budget issue where hours were capped.  Andrew was capped at about 45 hours per week. \n\n* Andrew had always done Mac support here and there on the side, but he started doing technical support for a web hosting company. \n\n* He was getting into DNS and Linux at the time. \n\n* Andrew would do support for a couple of hours per night and was eventually brought in as a part owner.  He even got to go to Canada to meet the other owners at one point. \n\n* It was about finding another outlet that aligned to his day job.  It was a decent side income and work he found interesting. \n\n* How do you know when to put down the side gig? \n\n* This came as Andrew left the university. \n\n* Sometimes there is an upward gravitational pull when you want to do good work and make things better.   \n\n* Andrew felt it was to some extent rinse and repeat.  He would try to automate some of the work.  \n\n* Andrew realized that jumping over to the partner side was extremely interesting.  He had a very good partner SE (Sales Engineer) at the time.   \n\n* Andrew knew if he were to pour himself into a partner SE role (hybrid pre-sales and post-sales), it is not a 40-45 hour per week role.  As a result he would need to pare down the side work. \n\n* The earning potential of making this move was tremendous versus staying on the customer side.   \n\n* It took him two years or so to dial back the work for the web hosting company because he really liked the people he worked with. \n\n* There was a realization it would be better for his career to double down and focus on one path as opposed to diversifying his time and income. \n\n* Let's define terms! \n\n* Customer - you are the one running servers, storage, etc. for a business where IT departments exist to run internal systems \n\n* Partner - in this case Andrew is referring to a channel partner.  Sometimes it can be called a value added reseller  (VAR) solution integrator.  This would be a company that can look across different technologies and vendors to stitch together a solution for a customer.  In some cases it is can be \"help me buy 10 widgets.\"  In others there are pre-sales and post-sales engineers.   \n\n* This position allows you to see more of the industry. \n\n* Alliance Partner - Andrew works for Pure Storage today.  They have channel partners like Presidio, WWT, Sirius, and others.  VMware and Cisco would be alliance partners that Pure works together with. \n\n* Leveraged compensation - going from a defined paycheck (you make a certain amount whether salary or hourly) to OTE (on target earnings) made up of a base salary (consistently paid to you) and a commission (related to items sold).  You can exceed based on what it sold. \n\n* As you go from partner to any kind of non-customer role, try not to sell your technical soul.  Look at a customer's needs and see where things fit, emphasizing the positives, building momentum, never lying, and knowing when to disclose any relevant negatives.  You have to figure out how to operate as a technologist working within an organization that ultimately sells stuff to customers (and hopefully good stuff that they need). \n\n* John says there's an important part of choosing who your employer is to this. \n\n## 42:39 - Motivated by the Right Things \n\n* Andrew mentions the idea of still being motivated by the right things. \n\n* He wanted to experience new challenges. \n\n* Some of the better SEs he has seen either came from a customer background or empathize well with a customer's situation so they know what it like day to day for a customer (considering day 1 as architecting / implementing and day 2 as operating the technology). \n\n* Maybe the products in use do have operational overhead.  But alternatives in the space may be more even complex to operate. \n\n* You need to understand where a product is good and help customers be aware of any FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) that has been generated through other vendor solution marketing. \n\n* Highlight for customers things they need to check on or look into, especially if there are false claims or embellished claims. \n\n* Sometimes there is a persona shift of \"I've been the technical person.  I'm not in sales.\"  Andrew recommends reading [The Art of Pre-Sales](http://www.definethecloud.net/the-art-of-pre-sales/) article by Joe Onisick where he defines 5 rules of Pre-Sales Engineering, including the fact that you are not a salesperson but live inside a sales organization.  Read this if you want to know what being in pre-sales is all about! \n\n* One principle not in that article according to Andrew is when in a meeting and you're there to be an expert, there is a fascinating phrase \"I don't know.\"  If you say that too soon in the conversation it can be a bad thing.  Past a certain point in a sales cycle or conversation, it actually builds credibility.   \n\n* One neat trick might be to order the topics so that things you know the best are first and the \"I don't know\" topics are later. \n\n* Nick says this approach could work really well when making a pitch to your boss to bring in a new technology. \n\n* Andrew says be intentional without being manipulative. \n\n* John shares the story of getting the job at VMware (first vendor job) and taking a class in value selling, which encouraged attendees to understand personal and professional motivations and values of the person you are speaking with.  John says you need to know this as a direct report to your boss. \n\n* John says many of the things we consider sales skills cross over to be effective operations skills as well, and he wishes he had learned this lesson when he was in IT Operations.  Listen to the story about John making a pitch for a newer version of backup software to his boss. \n\n* Andrew mentions he's had multiple disaster recovery ideas denied for the same reasons. \n\n* Adjusting the style based on where you are in the organization and who you are meeting with can really help. \n\n* Andrew mentioned he was coached to start with the conclusion first by an executive and then break it down from there because he had already gained trust. \n\n* Check out [this article](https://www.mynameisjehad.com/making-the-case-to-decision-makers-the-presentation-format-to-follow/) with more details on this idea regarding presentation style. \n\n* John says this aligns with the training he mentioned previously.  Consider the fact that an executive may leave the meeting early (or check out mentally) and might not hear the conclusion if you slowly build to a conclusion instead of sharing it up front. \n\n* This idea also aligns with the [great demo](https://greatdemo.com/) methodology and to start amidst the peak action. \n\n* There's also the \"you could have this\" idea (or what Nick refers to as future state architecture). \n\n* By networking with people like Andrew it can provide a future state vision and architecture for someone's career. \n\n* Don't miss Andrew's presentation on The Golden Hammer -

In today's episode we share part 2 of an interview with Andrew Miller, discussing Andrew's journey into management of a pre-sales engineering team and move to a building a technical marketing team at a startup in hypergrowth mode. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 02-10-2022 \n\n[Andrew Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriven/) is a Principal Technologist within the Office of the CTO at Pure Storage.  Follow him on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/andriven).  Catch part 1 of our interview with Andrew in [Episode 165](https://nerd-journey.com/excel-by-being-intentional-with-andrew-miller-1-3/).  [[Andrew Miller]] [[Episode 165]] #PureStorage \n\nTopics – Experience in Management, Advice for the Aspiring Manager, Remote Teams, Rubrik and Hypergrowth, Stress and Burnout \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:39 - Experience in Management \n\n* You don't realize how hard a role is until you have done it. \n\n* Andrew had a partner SE that he got along with really well who would sometimes wander in conversations before getting to the point.   \n\n* Andrew later realized this was about conveying bad news the right way.  Some people need to be led into it carefully based on how they are doing, whereas others prefer the direct approach (just come right out and say it).  These are learned patterns. \n\n* Andrew's sister was a textbook editor in China for a while.  Writing styles there are quite different and almost like multiple similar passes at proving the same point. \n\n* Wandering into management was interesting.  He was at a partner for a number of years and head hunted away to Varrow (which grew from 30 to 150 employees) as an early SE. \n\n* The team had grown so much and did not want to lose talented SEs.  In this case the company asked Andrew and a peer to act as managing SEs where half the team would roll up to each.  They still worked with some of the high touch customers also. \n\n* Andrew's peer eventually left, and he managed the whole team, becoming the first SE Manager at Varrow.  At the time he was looking for new challenges. \n\n* The management role is a gratifying, fascinating psychological role that gives you the ability to build people up over time.  It can be interesting to build a team. \n\n* He had a team of many who used to be his peers and needed to transition to people manager. \n\n* Andrew allowed his direct reports flexibility for when they would do 1-1 (weekly or every 2 weeks), but they still needed to do the 1-1s. \n\n* Someone recommended a [manager basics podcast series](https://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics) to Andrew, and Andrew started listening. \n\n* Some of the recommendations from the podcasts were things Andrew had stumbled into and knew worked.   \n\n* For 1-1s specifically, Andrew had a former boss who only called him when there was a problem.  Andrew decided to have a good relationship with his people so that not every call was a fear of bad news. \n\n* A 1-1 for Andrew consists of things he wants to tell his employee, things he wants them to tell him, and news of anything high profile to get ahead of problems. \n\n* The cadence of communication was important. \n\n* Note that manager tools is a podcast we have referred to many times on the show. \n\n* So much of this is about caring about people. \n\n* Don Jones mentioned in [Episode 137](https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/) and [Episode 138](https://nerd-journey.com/apprentice-amplifier-and-people-developer-with-don-jones-2-2/) that leadership is a different job.  [[Episode 137]] [[Episode 138]]\n\n* Andrew recommends reading [What Got You Here Won't Get You There](https://www.amazon.com/What-Got-Here-Wont-There-ebook/dp/B000Q9J128) by [[Marshall Goldsmith]]. [[What Got You Here Won't Get You There]] \n\n* Even if you don't read the book, there so much in the phrase. \n\n* Think about the things that got you to where you are today as an individual contributor, for example.  Maybe it's attention to detail or knowing all the details.  Those same skills might make you a micromanager as a leader. \n\n* As a manager, politics is not a dirty word.  If there are people there is politics.  You can be politically aware without playing politics and manage up (to your leadership chain, advocating for your team) and manage down (to your reports) well. \n\n* Not managing up well can do your team a disservice. \n\n* This is the idea of developing relationships / personal capital that you have time to develop now that you're in the role. \n\n* When your team needs something you have the resources to help accomplish it (the personal capital).  You have been put in a position to build up the capital and need to seize that opportunity. \n\n*  Sometimes when hiring a people leader there is the concept of build versus buy.  What skills would an employer pay for compared to those they would allow a person to develop? \n\n* Andrew says he would like someone with hard skills relatable to what the group to be managed does, but he would rather hire someone with initiative, with the emotional intelligence, who gets along with people.  That person can then learn the hard skills. \n\n* If you're interviewing for a manager role, what skills might be non-negotiable (things they need to buy)?  These may not be spelled out in the job description.  Think about how you want to present your skills so that someone will take a chance on you. \n\n## 15:04 - Advice for the [[Aspiring Manager]] \n\n* There must be enough motivation (that goes outside yourself).  Make sure to count the cost around whether this is a career step up and know you hold the careers of others in your hands. \n\n* It needs to be about more than \"I just want the next step in my career.\" \n\n* It's possible going into management may be the only role you see in front of you even though it isn't what you want.  Taking that path can end up burning some professional bridges. \n\n* Nick is reminded of [[Ethan Banks]]' story from [Episode 42](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-042-ethan-banks-and-the-journey-to-career-self-awareness/).  Ethan thought he wanted to be a manager and hated it. [[Episode 42]]\n\n* Before his interview with Rubrik, Andrew spoke to Ethan Banks to get a sense of what [[Chris Wahl]] might be like (Andrew's future boss). \n\n## 17:20 - #Remote Teams \n\n* Andrew's management experience has only been with remote teams.  The last time he went to an office every day was 2008. \n\n* There must be a regular communication cadence.  Sometimes you need to go above and beyond (video calls instead of regular phone calls, etc.). \n\n* In some of these roles business travel is expected.  Andrew has hired people who have had experience with it and some without it.  He advises us to think about being able to juggle travel as a skill.  If you have never done it before, you don't really know how your body will react, how it will impact your family, etc. \n\n* If someone is not confident you can figure it out they may be reluctant to take a chance on you. \n\n* Don't underestimate the value of 1-1s with reports. \n\n* Try to tease out someone's self motivation during the interview process. \n\n* In pre-sales often times the output is well defined based on metrics (but not always). \n\n* In other roles the outcomes are not as clear, and defining expected output is harder. \n\n* Andrew shares a story of having a direct report set their own goals for success and then agreeing they would be the measurements.  The person, however, struggled to meet their own goals. \n\n* It feels like before COVID / during COVID remote work is an expected job skill.   \n\n* If you're not able to work from home with good audio and video setup, it can be a hindrance.  Put some time into resolving that (which may require some investment but can be small). \n\n* If there is a HQ (headquarters), there seems to be a HQ center of gravity. \n\n* For example, pre-sales folks often times work in the field and from home a lot of the time. \n\n* When the role is at HQ, if you're remote you are the person on the conference call with more people in the room.  You start to lose what is going on a bit. \n\n* Think about possibly compensating for this through regular trips to HQ. \n\n* This is a real fear of missing out.  To some extent this is about emotional intelligence that may be lost through being remote. \n\n* For example, when we say John White or Andrew Miller, what is the emotion you experience? \n\n* You remember how you felt about a person you worked with even if you didn't remember what they did specifically. \n\n* If the emotional response to the person on the other end is not positive, you can send some positive energy their way (through repetition).  Think about how people perceive you. \n\n* For every negative interaction you need to have 8-10 positive interactions.  We remember negative things more strongly.  Be aware of this as you interact with people. \n\n## 26:11 - Rubrik and Hypergrowth \n\n* The patterns managing technical marketing personnel at Rubrik were slightly different than those of managing technical pre-sales folks. \n\n* The SEs who worked for Andrew were a bit easier to get going.   \n\n* Andrew was the first hire in technical marketing at Rubrik. He was hired to be part technical evangelist and part engineer, speaking at many events. \n\n* Andrew was also hired to build out a team.  He hired 12 people during a 2-year period when the company went from 200 to about 1300 people. \n\n* It was a different level of management.  He was generally focused on people who could bring in technical skills, public speaking, and writing.  Some reports to Andrew required more help to develop than others. \n\n* It was a stretch of a role.  Some of it may have been a result of being at a hypergrowth startup. \n\n* Andrew had been on the customer side for 7 years and on the partner side for 8 years at this point.  Note that Varrow eventually became Sirius Computer Solutions. \n\n* Before Rubrik Andrew had taken some time off and began doing some networking when he returned. \n\n* There were opportunities at partners and some at EMC as well as the Rubrik role. \n\n* He looked back to the growth of Varrow and remembered how much he learned during that compressed period (if you can survive).   \n\n* If a company is growing fast enough over time, it becomes a different company. \n\n* Andrew had not been on the vendor side of things before but was getting contacted about technical marketing roles.  He tells us that technical marketing can mean different things based on whether it reports into product management, engineering, or marketing within an organization. \n\n* At this time, Rubrik was in the beginning of hypergrowth.  Andrew thought about whether he would regret not taking the job and was really interested in seeing part of the industry. \n\n* At the end of 2 years it felt more like 5, but he learned so much. \n\n* Scott Lowe shared in [Episode 153](https://nerd-journey.com/creating-a-full-stack-career-with-scott-lowe-2-2/) why he prefers a startup environment. \n\n## 31:50 - Stress and #Burnout \n\n* Time zones stink and so did the pace.  He was spending a lot of time in Palo Alto despite living on the east coast. \n\n* Andrew was enjoying this, and he was able to meet so many different people. \n\n* Rubrik was a high concentration of very capable people.  Getting to see how so many aspects of it worked was exciting. \n\n* You start to see some of the dynamics of how a software vendor works. \n\n* Andrew realize he was starting to wander close to burnout.   \n\n* Am I pushing hard enough, do I care enough, can I outwork the pace, and do I care enough about my team? \n\n* Andrew has huge respect for people who have longevity at startups. \n\n* Andrew really needed to pause and consider what he wanted to do next. \n\n* While it was an awesome period, his kids (twin boys) were growing up more. \n\n* He was fortunate enough to have career options. \n\n* Andrew wanted to pull back to something that would enable him to run pretty hard but not too fast (slow down a little bit). \n\n* Sometimes Andrew pushed hard enough, the only thing he knew to do was to take a pause (no way to dial it back). \n\n* John says it is interesting that there are multiple stressors here - time zones, travel, having 12 direct reports, etc.  You may be able to handle some of them but not all of them. \n\n* Andrew interviewed around 100 people during this period. \n\n* When he worked at the partners it was hard to find talent.  When working at Rubrik there were so many talented people who wanted to get into the company that there had to be a way to filter down the interviews. \n\n* You become keenly aware of how important networking is.  Remediating hiring risk can be done by looking at a person's network. \n\n* For fast growing companies, it isn't just about the resume.  It's about building a strong network that can be leveraged for opportunities. \n\n* Nick mentioned the energy one can get from networking with people inside and outside the company or through attending conferences and its capability to make up for a lack of sleep. \n\n* There's also new employee syndrome.  For the first two or three months you're in burst mode.  You start to be a known quantity. \n\n* When your company is growing that fast, it's like every quarter it is a new company.  You're essentially needing to be in that high energy burst mode all the time. \n\n* Paying specific attention to political waters is yet another stressor per John.  Handling multiple stressors continuously like this absolutely could lead someone to burnout. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. ","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-167":{"title":"Episode 167","content":"\n# Episode 167\n\nWelcome to episode 167 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

Deciding to Pause \n\n* Kudos to Andrew for recognizing where he was headed and being humble enough to step back. \n\n* Andrew had taken time off between Sirius and Rubrik.  He took some time to visit family.  This is not something you do without a bit of planning. \n\n* Andrew started to see some of the people he worked with behave in ways that wasn't really their normal.  There were also those inside the company who felt threatened by new employees and became territorial. \n\n* Andrew started to do some analysis on if he was becoming that type of person or if it was possible to experience \"shades\" of it. \n\n* Based on the energy you have, can you lean into what is the right thing to do?  Or are you starting to say \"this is good enough\" or caring less? \n\n* Andrew references Bilbo from [The Fellowship of the Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring) - too little butter scraped across too much toast. [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]\n\n* You start to feel all the directions in which you're being pulled.  Can you reset the expectations or take a pause, step outside, and find the next thing?   \n\n* The hardest thing is leaving people you care about.  It's a super hard decision.  You want to help the people you hired as much as you can, but ultimately we each are responsible for our own careers. \n\n* John says beware of personal contracts with people you hired (i.e. they came to a place to work for you specifically).   \n\n* Also, in this case, maybe you can look at the stressors and have some of them removed by management (which may or may not be possible). \n\n* Stepping back like this takes some character on a person's part.  And you have to set yourself up financially for these kinds of decisions.  Otherwise you don't have the flexibility to walk away. \n\n* Andrew members speaking to [Ken Hui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennethhui/) and [Keith Townsend](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kltownsend/) and advises us to live below our means to provide financial flexibility. [[Ken Hui]] [[Keith Townsend]] [[Personal Finance]]\n\n* Andrew went to a conservative Christian college and remembers a professor advising the class to build a fund for in the event their boss asked something they were not willing to do. \n\n* Imagine knowing that if you leave, you will be fine.  That gives you the ability to leave and doesn't require putting financial priorities on top of everything else. \n\n* Going back to leveraged compensation plan, live off the base to minimize stress. \n\n* We don't need to keep up with the Jones'.  Financial security gives you options.  See also [Dave Ramsey](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/). [[Dave Ramsey]]\n\n* We don't want an escalating lifestyle that matches an escalating salary.  Sometimes money is a trap. \n\n* Check out [Episode 57](https://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-5-personal-finance/) for a show focused on personal finance. [[Episode 57]]\n\n* Having an emergency fund is important and a foundational part of being a solid member of  our society.  We toss out some book recommendations: \n\n* [Rich Dad, Poor Dad](amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680194) by [[Robert Kiyosaki]] [[Rich Dad, Poor Dad]] \n\n* [The Automatic Millionaire](https://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Millionaire-Expanded-Updated-Powerful/dp/0451499085) by [[David Bach]] [[The Automatic Millionaire]]\n\n* [Personal Finance for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/Personal-Finance-Dummies-Eric-Tyson/dp/1119517893) by [[Eric Tyson]] [[Personal Finance for Dummies]] \n\n## 13:55 - The Break and the Move to Pure Storage \n\n* Airline miles and reward programs are wonderful things.  Andrew and family were able to go visit extended family in Singapore during his break after time at Rubrik.  His kids were about 8 years old at that time and were doing homeschool. \n\n* It was one of those \"why not do this now\" moments. \n\n* Some say you have to take 2 weeks of vacation to make any real impact because it takes a week for your brain to empty. \n\n* This period was a pause to determine where he wanted to go next.  Andrew had enjoyed building people up and supporting their careers but also individual contributor work.   \n\n* The role at [Pure Storage](https://www.purestorage.com/), where Andrew works as of this recording, is an individual contributor role.  It's Director level but without direct reports.  #PureStorage \n\n* You're working with customers, going deep in some areas, sharing vision and strategy, but also linked back to product teams and marketing (webinar presentation, feedback on future features, etc.). \n\n* This Principal Technologist role is part of the pre-sales organization. \n\n* Because the role is semi-defined, there is a certain day-to-day expectation.  But there is a high degree of latitude to fill gaps and help support positive change.   \n\n* He started as Principal Systems Engineer, but there was a little bit of a transition where this was a super SE role.  As Pure was continuing to grow, there was no way to be a super SE any longer.  Pure started to hire more overlays and added \"nerds who are allowed to talk,\" mixing business and technology.  The Principal Technologist is one such overlay. \n\n* Andrew also thinks about a 2x2 matrix for the semi-defined role as a way to determine where to put your time to make an impact.  On one side is micro and macro, and then you have reactive and proactive. \n\n\nScope | Reactive | Proactive \n-------|-------------------|--------\n**Micro** | Micro-Reactive | Micro-Proactive\n**Macro** | Macro-Reactive | Macro-Proactive\n\n* Microreactive fills over time - this is servant leadership and getting pulled into help others \n\n* Macroreactive - you're getting pulled into bigger initiatives \n\n* Microproactive is reaching out to SEs and peers, product management, and others seeking only to get to know others and build a relationship (not asking them for anything) \n\n* Macroproactive is the fun one (trying to help but on a wider scale).  You can use the microreactive experience as a data mining exercise to fuel the macroproactive. \n\n* For example, during COVID, Andrew was involved in the Pure Coffee Break series of webinars (one example of that can be found [here](https://www.purestorage.com/au/video/webinars/september-coffee-break/6290531384001.html)). \n\n* Keep the industry trends and solution focus relevant to customers, share what the field is seeing, and then dive deeper. \n\n* Andrew fundamentally likes where Pure is going as a company and wanted to keep some of his infrastructure roots.  With the acquisition of [Portworx](https://portworx.com/) and release of other new products, Andrew feels the company will allow him to continue to grow and expand his skillset without falling behind in the industry. \n\n* Andrew says they did a survey on one of the most recent coffee break, and the one that came in highest was Pure's cloud strategy. \n\n## 24:08 - Thoughts on the Principal Role \n\n* This title varies between organizations.  The smaller the organization the more titles are free. \n\n* Principal is often the pinnacle or height of the individual contributor path.   \n\n* Andrew maps to the East US Enterprise region (where he gets customer calls, etc.).  Then he also does projects that are more national and global in nature (webinar, feature contributions, filing patents, etc.). \n\n* Fun fact - Andrew has helped with 5 patent filings since being at Pure. \n\n* There is a sense that someone in this role is experienced and can bring value to a conversation with a customer without a \"look at me\" kind of attitude. \n\n* Nick mentions somoene in Andrew's role knows what good looks like. \n\n* You also need to understand people's motivations, how to navigate the organization you operate in, etc. \n\n* John says he needs to double down on reading [Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the Management Track](https://www.amazon.com/Staff-Engineer-Leadership-beyond-management-ebook/dp/B08RMSHYGG) by [[Will Larson]]. [[Staff Engineer]]   \n\n* Folks in the Staff role are being looked upon more as leaders, to think strategically, and to be a force multiplier.  The book is slanted toward the software development career path but still quite valuable. \n\n* John feels this book has not been written for the pre-sales technical track. \n\n* Andrew got to meet [Chad Sakac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadsakac/) at one point.  There was a good quote about everyone being a leader.  Someone is looking at you.  We get more of what we praise.  Leaders simply have a larger blast radius. [[Chad Sakac]]\n\n* Anyone can send an e-mail to tell someone they did a great job, etc.  Leaders get to do it more visibly in things that encourage more. \n\n* Anyone can put praise out about good behavior.  You could very well make someone's day by pointing out something they did that was positive.   \n\n* John believes he got the term \"blast radius\" from Chad Sakac. \n\n## 29:25 - Parting Thoughts and What Comes Next \n\n* You're trying to do your best work no matter who is looking.  That is your brand and living up to your own standards. \n\n* If you're putting yourself in the right places (where companies are growing, where you can meet people, etc.) the right time will eventually come with some level of leaning into opportunities when they surface. \n\n* Opportunities are often disguised as hard work. \n\n* Right now, for Andrew, he is very happy in his role.  It has enough variety to do different things and can build good working relationships. \n\n*Andrew is not sure what will be next. \n\n* Throughout his career he didn't have grand plans with each move.  It was more of looking of an interesting opportunity. \n\n* Keep perspective about how blessed and fortunate you are.  This comes in how you present yourself to people.  It can be easy to get into those emotional spirals.   \n\n* Andrew likes to constantly add for feedback.  \"What's one thing I could improve or you think might be worth changing?\" \n\n* Feedback is a gift.  By asking for it you get prepared to receive it (proper frame of mind).   \n\n* Andrew has had people suggest specific roles he should pursue (\"you should think about…\"). \n\n* Nick says this is like the future state career architecture. \n\n* Do good work.  Work with good people.  Have an impact.  Don’t be too full of yourself, but be aware of where you can make an impact and do good work relative to relative skillset. And keep some joy in it!  \n\n* Check out [this post](https://thinkmeta.net/2016/09/09/an-amazing-15-years-heres-to-whats-next/) Andrew wrote to cast a wide net after his first sabbatical. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.030588876Z","tags":null},"/Episode-168":{"title":"Episode 168","content":"\n# Episode 168\n\nWelcome to episode 168 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 1 of an interview with Mike Wood, discussing his early career in law enforcement, a move to software consulting and heavy travel, and life at a company that was acquired. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 02-24-2022 \n\nTopics – Meet Mike Wood, Start with the BASICs, Fitting into Law Enforcement, Relatable Experience, A Move to Consulting, Breaking New Ground across the Miles, Acquisitions and a Culture Clash,  [[Mike Wood]] \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:16 - Meet Mike Wood \n\n* [Mike Wood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikewo/) currently works for Microsoft as a Technical Program Manager of a group called Commercial Software Engineering.  This is an enablement organization inside Microsoft, working with and coding with some of Microsoft's largest customers to solve problems on the Azure platform (cloud and edge). \n\n* Mike and team then take the solutions / shared learnings back to Microsoft product teams, figuring if they can solve a problem for one of Microsoft's largest customers they can solve it for everyone. \n\n* This also helps product teams prioritize issues. \n\n## 3:41 - Start with the BASICs \n\n* Mike started out with a Commodore 64.  He and his brother wanted a computer.  Mike's father was advised to buy them a Commodore but not any games. \n\n* Back then the Commodore machines came with a book that taught you the [BASIC programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC). \n\n* There were no disk drives.  At some point Mike and his brother got a cassette drive to save their programs.  There was a magazine they would get which had programs in it you could type into your computer. \n\n* Mike took some programming courses in high school as well.  This got him started in technology but was not where he started his career. \n\n## 5:19 - Fitting into Law Enforcement \n\n* When Mike was growing up he wanted to be in law enforcement, specifically federal investigations (FBI, Secret Service, etc.).  He went to college with the intent to get a degree, get some related experience as a police officer, and then apply to the FBI. \n\n* Mike's degree is in police administration from Eastern Kentucky University (nothing to do with technology). \n\n* He took a couple of classes in Pascal because he knew they would be easy based on doing it in high school also. \n\n* Mike got a job as a police officer for a short time and realized it was not really for him. \n\n* He remembers calling his dad to share that it was not working out as an officer. \n\n* Mike was the last sibling to move out of the house.  The county he grew up in was very small without a large number of opportunities. \n\n* At this point he had to decide what he wanted to do.  Mike knew how to code and create websites.   \n\n* Mike found a job offered by Eastern  Kentucky University's housing department.  They needed someone familiar with the Alpha 4 databases, which Mike had worked on in high school. \n\n* The work ended up being mostly mainframe stuff that he used to make housing assignments. \n\n* At one point he got sucked into using Microsoft Access.  The director of housing thought Access was a great way to automate housing assignments.  This turned into a side project for Mike that led him into [VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications). \n\n* When Mike realized this work was not going to go much farther (as far as the programming piece), he began to look for programming roles or doing consulting work for other companies. \n\n* Not being a good fit for the police offer job came as a surprise to the then 21-year-old Mike. \n\n* At some point he realized he was making decisions that were to have a tremendous impact on someone's life. \n\n* He has a tremendous amount of respect for those who work in law enforcement and mentioned you gain a different perspective if you have done that job. \n\n* It's not an easy job.  You rarely ever dealing with someone when it is their good day.  Usually the person you are interacting with have done something wrong or have had something bad happen to them.   \n\n* This can start to shape how you see people in general.  Mike could see down the road as to how this might affect his perceptions of people and didn't feel like he could make the right life-impacting decisions as a 21-year-old for those people he encountered.  \n\n* Mike decided to take a step back, realizing the work was not for him.  He still held out hopes of potentially later pursuing a role with the FBI (since it would be more investigation focused). \n\n* Once he got into consulting, he never pursued this path in investigation again. \n\n* John hadn't thought about this aspect of general law enforcement.  He was thinking more about those closer to the incarceration process and seeing a negative side of humanity over and over again. \n\n* Mike says the exposure to this can affect how you trust people / how you build trust / if you have the ability to trust people at all.   \n\n* You can eventually come to an understanding that not people are that way, but Mike is able to say this this after many years of life experience (not so obvious at 21). \n\n## 12:50 - Relatable Experience \n\n* Nick mentions you don't often know all the details of a role until you go and do it. \n\n* You can read job descriptions and even talk to people in a specific role, but there are certain aspects you won't know until you do the job. \n\n* Mike can't think back to a single job description he read that was not somewhat different once he got into the role.  And job descriptions are always changing and adjusting to business needs, leadership changes, a global pandemic, etc. \n\n* \"Any job that you start in…expect it to change.\" - Mike Wood \n\n* Mike did gain some very relatable experience from law enforcement like being able to read people and situations. \n\n* He also gained confidence to confront and have hard conversations when needed (even though he is not an extrovert by nature).   \n\n* This has come into play in Mike's career when something needs to be addressed that he perceives to be a problem (and no one else is willing to speak up). \n\n* It's an important skill to raise the difficult questions.  Many of us fear looking silly in front of a group of people. \n\n* This is a bit like when you're trying to find a solution to a problem and search Google with no results. It can mean no one has had this problem (likely not true), it's so simple that no one else has needed to look for it / documented it, or it could be your Google search skills are lacking (i.e. not searching for the right thing). \n\n* People need to overcome the fear of looking stupid or changing someone's perception of them by asking a question.  It is highly likely someone else has the same question but may be too shy or afraid to ask. \n\n* John says your value to an organization could be in being the fearless one who asks questions. \n\n* This is what technical program managers at Microsoft do.  Their role is very similar to a product owner but at the same time asking a lot of the questions when you're with the customer.   \n\n* Keep asking questions to keep getting deeper.  Being able to pull in all that information, summarize it, and convey it to others who can solve the problems is a critical skill. \n\n## 18:38 - A Move to Consulting \n\n* Mike has been in the software industry for over 20 years.  He transitioned around 1997 into consulting. \n\n* One of the positions Mike got as a step in that direction was with a small firm in Lexington, Kentucky.  It was mostly a networking and infrastructure group with Mike and his manager focused on software development. \n\n* The firm was very successful when it came to configuring new systems for customers, procuring hardware, etc.  The salespeople were really good, almost too good when only two people were doing development.  This meant lots of projects. \n\n* As part of this, Mike came to learn Visual Basic 6 and SQL Server.  This came right after having experience in Microsoft Access in the work at Eastern Kentucky University. \n\n* Mike had taken no theory classes on programming to get an understanding of [classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/walkthrough-defining-classes) and [inheritance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics). \n\n* He learned what he needed to know by analyzing and reading the code previously written for the firm. \n\n* Nick equates this to turning on the [macro recorder](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/automate-tasks-with-the-macro-recorder-974ef220-f716-4e01-b015-3ea70e64937b) in Microsoft Excel. \n\n* Mike and his manager would look at various parts of the code to determine how things worked and why they worked. \n\n## 22:48 - Breaking New Ground across the Miles \n\n* With the salespeople for the firm being so good, Mike remembers getting to the point where he would work a lot.  Being young and single at the time, and it didn't bother him too much. \n\n* Mike started to realize how much he was working and got stressed about the number of deadlines.  He felt more personnel were needed, but the company was not in a position to add head count. \n\n* At this point, Mike started looking around, wanting to get to a company where it was more than just Mike and his manager so there could be many smart people from which he could learn. \n\n* Mike's manager at the firm had great business sense, but it was just the two of them. \n\n* With so many projects, there was rarely time to learn new things.    The phrase of the day was often \"get it done.\" \n\n* Mike started interviewing with other consulting companies, and that meant moving out of the Lexington area.  He landed a job at GA Sullivan in Cincinnati (with the main office in St. Louis). \n\n* This change turned out to be one of the best of his career.  Mike worked with some of the best people that he ever has (and that he still talks to today). \n\n* This was more Visual Basic, SQL Server, and some [ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages). \n\n* Mike got onto a project right when Visual Studio .NET was new (between beta 1 and beta 2). \n\n* Microsoft Consulting Services had GA Sullivan and one other partner come in to help on re-writing an entire CRM using .NET that was previously written using ASP (Active Server Pages).  This may have been one of the largest projects at this time that was taking place outside of Redmond. \n\n* Everything was new.  Half the code base was written in C# and half was in Visual Basic.NET. \n\n* The project had to be complete for a conference where the customer was going to showcase the new system. \n\n* There were many discussions on scope.  They started using the [waterfall methodology](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/methodologies/waterfall) at first but ended up having to do things differently. \n\n* They were doing [agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile)-like things in the end, but no one in their group at the time was an expert in that area. \n\n* This was software built before [MVC](https://www.codecademy.com/article/mvc) came to fruition (which is fascinating to imagine). \n\n* Nick mentions the development environments we have available often shape our work, but it's interesting to hear the contrasts of before and after. \n\n* Mike was able to work with some outstanding people as a result of this collaboration with Microsoft and the other firm. \n\n* Mike was able to learn a great deal from Microsoft personnel who had been in consulting for a long time. \n\n* Since this was between two beta builds of Visual Studio, it wasn't like you could go ask someone on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for help.  The team of people Mike was working with had a special build and would send questions back to Microsoft which was funneled back to product teams and then answered. \n\n* John says the working with really smart people aspect resonates with him.  He also wants the people he works with to be smart in different ways than him. \n\n* The people were a very big part of what made this job interesting and enjoyable to Mike while at GA Sullivan.  Mike said it really felt like a family of people with different backgrounds. \n\n* Mike says they had an architect on staff, for example, with a background in mechanical engineering who decided he wanted to code and was a great source of learning for Mike. \n\n* There were also instructors who taught courses on SQL Server who had become consultants as well as those who had more of an IT background. \n\n* GA Sullivan was primarily a Microsoft development shop.  Coding tied the group together.  Many times Microsoft Consulting Services would send business to GA Sullivan. \n\n* In addition to the people he worked with, the projects were very interesting. \n\n* Mike was able to learn .NET right at the beginning, which certainly helped his understanding of how things worked down the road.   \n\n* It was a pretty small company of around 300-400 distributed across locations.  They had some small offices in Europe. \n\n* Mike never really had to travel too far away from home, which actually contributed to his leaving the group. \n\n## 34:46 - Acquisitions and a Culture Clash \n\n* GA Sullivan was acquired by a group called Avenade, which is a large consulting firm that was a joint venture between Accenture and Microsoft. \n\n* After the acquisition and finishing up with his latest client Mike was told he would be on the bench for a bit and would have some study time. \n\n* He tells the story of receiving a call on Friday and being asked to be in Cincinnati on Monday for a new client. \n\n* Mike mentioned this is not the type of company he would have interviewed with because of the requirement for regular travel. \n\n* At this time Mike had been married for about 4 months.  The commute from his home in Kentucky to Cincinnati was 5-6 hours.  He would drive up there and then carpool part of the way with some fellow consultants. \n\n* This allowed him to drive 45 minutes, park his car, and let someone else drive the remainder of the way. \n\n* They were asked to get to the client as early as possible on Monday and stay until 5 PM or later on Thursday.  Consultants could work from home or do administrative work on Friday from home. \n\n* The travel started to get to Mike and really was indefinite, which means the size of the project was such that it could be a while before it was completed. \n\n* At this point Mike began looking at another position outside Avenade. \n\n* Mike's next role was working for a division of [International Paper](https://www.internationalpaper.com/) that was focused on logistics. \n\n* He wanted to go work for a company to try it out, being able to drive to the same office consistently on a daily basis. \n\n* The group pontificate on how to make a high travel lifestyle work. \n\n* Nick suggests being the driver of the carpool and keeping the mileage money.   \n\n* John suggests building up loyalty rewards with an airline. \n\n* Mike says the constant travel lifestyle is something people really enjoy.  He likes to travel, but traveling for work is not what people think it is. \n\n* When Mike and colleagues were in Cleveland on a project they would leave work at 7-9 PM Monday - Thursday to leave Friday more open.  There were very few places open that late to eat dinner unless there was a basketball game. \n\n* Mike had a new family (being newly married).  The idea of staying over the weekend on his own dime was not for him.  There are people Mike knows who will work in a weekend sightseeing trip as part of an engagement in another city. \n\n* To Mike, the idea of taking a vacation means you go somewhere separate from work. \n\n* John thinks if you're stationed over 100 miles from home, it seems reasonable to have the option to stay the weekend without having to pay for it yourself, but from a consulting business standpoint that could cut into margins. \n\n* At the time he worked in Ohio, Mike definitely wanted to go home work weekends.  Many people at GA Sullivan were young families. \n\n* As it turns out in this case a company with a certain travel culture was acquired by another company with a different travel culture. \n\n* It would be interesting to talk to someone who is in mergers and acquisition and what happens when there are two vastly different travel cultures that need to come together.   \n\n* In the case of consulting companies, it's the people you are acquiring.  In some cases an acquisition of another consulting company could be for the customer base (i.e. break into new markets of customers). \n\n* This was the case with Avenade acquiring GA Sullivan.  It was a venture into a new market. \n\n* Mike has been through 3 acquisitions now, and not a single one has gone well for him. \n\n* For Mike's particular situation they have not worked out.  In one of the acquisitions, he was at a role where he needed to present data and answer questions about how things worked related to the technology footprint. \n\n* Out of the 3 acquisitions, for 2 he stayed long enough to be considered an employee of the new company.  For the 3rd he realized up front it would not work, leaving before the acquisition happened (on friendly terms) and realizing the culture would not be a proper fit for him. \n\n* In the two instances where he stayed, Mike realized it was not right for him.  Some of the cultural aspects are not immediately evident (going back to the fact that job descriptions aren't exactly what you read). \n\n* Mike recently gave a presentation, going into the topic of culture and what it is.  It's not foosball and ping pong tables.  If you didn't have those things would you still work there? \n\n* Culture is about valuing the people who work at a company.  Are people valued for who they are or what they can do?  There's no way to determine this without being in there working at the company or by knowing someone who can answer those questions honestly. \n\n* Nick has only been on the side of the company doing the acquiring from his manufacturing days.  People would want to know what IT systems were like at the company being acquired and how to link the systems together. \n\n* With so much uncertainty during these times, Nick feels it would be challenging to focus on what you can control. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-169":{"title":"Episode 169","content":"\n# Episode 169\n\nWelcome to episode 169 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 2 of our interview with Mike Wood, detailing his experience taking a personal sabbatical, how he spent the time off, and how he orchestrated his next career move.     \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 02-24-2022 \n\n[Mike Wood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikewo/) works for Microsoft as  Technical Program Manager of the Commercial Software Engineering group.  This is an enablement organization inside Microsoft, working with and coding with some of Microsoft's largest customers to solve problems on the Azure platform (cloud and edge).  Catch part 1 of our interview with Mike in [Episode 168](https://nerd-journey.com/hired-and-acquired-with-mike-wood-1-2/). [[Mike Wood]] [[Episode 168]] #Microsoft\n\nTopics – A Personal #Sabbatical, Deciding What to Do with the #Time, When Organizations Value People, Discovering What You Want, The #ResumeGap, Career Flexibility and Parting Thoughts \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:07 - A Personal Sabbatical \n\n* One of the acquisitions prompted Mike to take some time off (most recent one). \n\n* Mike was working for a company called SentryOne, a company that made monitoring software for SQL Server, which was acquired by [Solarwinds](https://www.solarwinds.com/) (a much larger company).  The acquisition is detailed [here](https://investors.solarwinds.com/news/news-details/2020/SolarWinds-Agrees-to-Acquire-SentryOne-Extending-the-Scale-and-Depth-of-Its-Database-Performance-Management-Capabilities-for-Microsoft-Data-Platform/default.aspx). \n\n* This was during the pandemic.  SentryOne had to furlough some people as well, making stress levels rise because the company was small enough for most employees to know all other employees, even across departments. \n\n* Then when the acquisition started, the team was told Solarwinds wanted the engineering talent and the technology to incorporate into the greater Solarwinds portfolio. \n\n* Mike wasn't concerned about losing his job but more about what he would do as part of Solarwinds. \n\n* At the time he was the Site Reliability Engineering Manager at SentryOne, a team that became a little smaller pre-acquisition. \n\n* The team shrank even more post-acquisition due to turnover. \n\n* This became very stressful, and it was not clear what Mike would be doing long-term for the company. \n\n* Things began to pile up.  He needed to take more time off than what he would be allowed to take and wasn't sure it would be the right place for him to return to after the time away. \n\n* This would not have been somewhere he would have applied to work. \n\n* Mike approached it from the standpoint of wanting to take more time off than he had vacation and take it immediately. \n\n* The decision to take time off was not a sudden decision but required much consideration up front. \n\n* It became a family discussion.  This was about a year before the time of this recording. \n\n* During the pandemic, Mike and his wife started taking walks together around the neighborhood after work to deal with stress. \n\n* His wife is a teacher who was working in a noncontinuing contract (only guaranteed employment for a single school year with no guarantee of another job the following fall). Mike needed to get out of what he was doing, and he was trying to determine feasibility.  This was a conversation that took place over many walks. \n\n* Mike and his wife had made some good financial decisions.  SentryOne made their employees part owners in the company, and employees made some money in the acquisition. \n\n* Mike and his wife had been saving money to do a project for their house. \n\n* They talked about how long they could sustain their current lifestyle (without raising it) with Mike not working for a while (a personal sabbatical).   \n\n* The original plan was for Mike to take a month off and do no job searching or have discussions about it, which means he would be out of work for more than a month at least.  At the end of that month, Mike would start looking for what's next with the goal to have a job within 3 months…which turned into 6. \n\n* The extended time period was partially due to specific things Mike was looking for and being confident he could make money on the side if needed. \n\n* Mike's wife got a new contract teaching (this time a continuing one) which paid the bills during this time.  At this point it became less of a rush for Mike, and he was able to pursue what he wanted to do. \n\n## 9:31 - Deciding What to Do with the Time \n\n* Before taking the sabbatical, Mike started writing down things he would do during the time off, which turned out to be a mix of things. \n\n* He renewed a certification in the first month and ended up racking up a couple more certifications along the way. \n\n* Mike spent more time with his family, but he's worked from home for over 8 years now.  More time with the family was Mike being available to do something when his son got home instead of 1.5 hours later. \n\n* A large portion of this was during the summer, so his wife was off work as well.  They took a trip to a small cabin and even spent time in Columbus but kept trips to a minimum. \n\n* Mike had a list of things that needed to be done around the house.   \n\n* One of Mike's hobbies is amateur radio, and one of the things he likes to do is called [Parks on the Air](https://parksontheair.com/).  There are activators that go to a local park with their radios.  There are people called chasers who are trying to get Parks on the Air contacts, and you get points for each role. \n\n* Mike spent some time trying to hit as many parks as possible and visited others here and there during the time away. \n\n* He also played a lot of video games.   \n\n* Mike spent a decent amount of time thinking about what was next for him.  After the first month he started asking himself… \n\n* Where do I want to work? \n\n* What type of company do I want to work for? \n\n* Do I want to continue in site reliability (his most recent work)? \n\n* If you want to change what you do and you put on LinkedIn that you're looking for jobs, it seems like you are pigeonholed into the most recent thing you've done. \n\n## 13:26 - When Organizations Value People \n\n* Mike did spend a lot of time thinking through what he wanted to do, which was extremely helpful.  He was able to have conversations with many people about what they did. \n\n* After having interviewed at Microsoft multiple times over the years and not making it (learning something every time), Mike thought it might be the right time to try again. \n\n* Mike had someone encourage him to interview with Microsoft back in the GA Sullivan days.   \n\n* \"I'm not saying you have to leave.  Just go interview.  Go and have that experience and know what that experience is like to interview with a large company.\" \n\n* Mike wishes he would have listened to that person back then,  stating he would have learned all the lessons from the last year. \n\n* The interviews in the past at small companies were very different. Some interviews early in Mike's career were very technical. \n\n* Interviewing at a large company was very different.  These companies have their own process you need to learn and understand. \n\n* Mike was advised to get [informationals](https://cultivatedculture.com/questions-to-ask-in-informational-interview/).  These are not formal interviews but are with hiring managers / someone at Microsoft about what their group does. \n\n* At Google these are called [champion calls](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Got-a-champion-call-at-google-tG7t0vei). \n\n* During the calls you talk about what the job is like, what it is like to work at the company, etc. \n\n* Most of them led Mike to the conclusion that the role may not be a good fit. \n\n* But during these calls, the person from Microsoft would ask what Mike wanted to do, what he did in the past, and what his interests were.  At the end of the call, most of the time, the person recommended he talk to someone else inside Microsoft. \n\n* Through this process (doing informationals), Mike found out about a number of roles inside Microsoft that he might not have found on the careers website. \n\n* This sounds somewhat similar to the LinkedIn Live career events VMware has done.  See [Episode 162](https://nerd-journey.com/a-love-for-digital-marketing-with-louise-bunyan-1-3/) for more detail. [[Episode 162]]\n\n* Nick loves the fact that the people Mike spoke to in the informationals wanted to help connect him with people who could share more about what he might want to do (almost like they could spot and enable talent). \n\n* This speaks volumes to Mike about how they (Microsoft) value the person.  If you have companies that recognize what a person is good at and what they want to do, the employee will be more engaged. \n\n* When Mike was at SentryOne he was a product manager for a couple of years and felt he had become less technical, which he did not like.   \n\n* Mike told his manager about this, who was super supportive. \n\n* It almost got to the point where he knew there was no path for him, and the folks at SentryOne were supportive of even that decision.  If Mike felt leaving was the best path, people at SentryOne could help him make connections even outside the company. \n\n* Mike had Azure experience from a previous role and was offered a role at SentryOne as a lead cloud engineer.  This turned out to be a great role for Mike and led him into the site reliability engineering position mentioned earlier.  He and his team got to help build up the SaaS offerings at SentryOne as well as processes around it.  Building all of this from scratch was a great learning opportunity. \n\n* The company realized if they put Mike in the position it will work out well.  Having companies that realize this and not just think of employees as cogs is refreshing. \n\n* John says it's possible you could learn a lot as a cog in the company's wheel, but in our careers we need to decide if it's ok for the company where we work to treat us like cogs.  Different points in time, mindsets, and personalities influence our decisions.  Being a cog may be exactly what you are looking for to gain specific skills or exposure.  And that is ok. \n\n## 21:45 - Discovering What You Want \n\n* Mike references [Brian Prince](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhprince/), someone who was a developer evangelist when they first met.  Brian said every year right around Christmas he would take a day off to think through whether he would recommit another year to his company or look elsewhere. \n\n* Are all the things I am looking for being met? \n\n* Am I excited about what I am doing?   \n\n* Or do I need something else?   \n\n* Am I getting what I want out of this? \n\n* Brian gave a great presentation with career advice at one point, and Mike took much of it to heart. \n\n* Mike does spend time thinking about whether what he does is what he wants to continue to do. \n\n* During the sabbatical this came into heavy focus.  You start writing down a list of the amount of travel, how much you need to make, and a number of other things. \n\n* In the software industry Mike feels the majority of us are blessed with decent / better than decent wages.  Though salaries in other areas may seem huge, Mike lives in the Midwest where the cost of housing is nowhere near what it is in other areas. \n\n* To some degree it comes down to whether you're happy with what you're doing, what you want to get out of it, if there is some part you want to share and give back, etc.  There is a lot of leeway in at the intersection of a fulfilling job and making what you need to make. \n\n* Perhaps you would give up some extra pay for certain things you want. \n\n* By the time the sabbatical came, Mike had been in his career for over 20 years.  Some things he already knew in terms of what he wanted (i.e. very clear). \n\n* There was a maximum amount of travel Mike would not surpass (was not worth it to him due to commitments outside of work). \n\n* He wanted to be hands on technical wherever he landed. \n\n* Mike looked back at all the places he had worked and at the things that worked out for him as well as those which did not.  This allows you to adjust what you want over time. \n\n* Some folks who found out about Mike's sabbatical were slightly freaked out by it (sticking to the concept of it being easier to find a job when you have one already). \n\n* Mike understands not everyone has money set aside to take a break like this. \n\n* He also had an extremely supportive wife throughout this whole process. \n\n* Mike already had the build up of the things in the past that shaped what he wanted from a job / company, but the break allowed him to truly focus on exactly what he wanted. \n\n* The informationals at Microsoft steered him into the right organizations. \n\n* There may be many openings at a company like Microsoft, but there are not that many if you're targeting a specific organization within.  That makes the cycle longer. \n\n* John says this is the sniper approach and not shooting skeet with shotguns. \n\n* The best time to be recruited for a better job than you have now is when you're in a job that you are happy with, which is very different from the best time to look for a job being when you have a job.  \n\n## 29:27 - The Resume Gap \n\n* Having taken a sabbatical and looking for a job, the hiring manager knows you're not working because they will ask where you are working now. \n\n* You need to be cautious here as it will affect your ability to negotiate. \n\n* If you have a job and you really enjoy it, it's easy to say thanks but no thanks. \n\n* When you don't have a job you don't want to be in a position of taking anything the company will give you. \n\n* Mike felt like he had a good network built up over the years so that he could find something (even if it was side work) to pay the bills until he could find something else. \n\n* Working for himself likely would have made Mike uncomfortable since he is not a great salesperson.  He also did not want to have to mess with health insurance and other things (a barrier to those who work for themselves).   \n\n* The 1099 hourly rate is much higher. \n\n* Mike mentions [Michael Eaton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeleeaton/), someone who was an independent contractor who was doing a talk on the pros and cons of being an independent consultant (marketing, selling, admin stuff, etc.). \n\n* Because of the pandemic, most everyone in the interview process was understanding of Mike's needing to take time off. \n\n* Microsoft as a company did a lot around wellbeing for its employees, providing extra wellbeing time off in addition to vacation days. \n\n* People understood the time off without Mike having to explain the acquisition process that led to the sabbatical. \n\n* If Mike had to interview again, he might have a different viewpoint on needing to explain the 6 month resume gap. \n\n* Mike was more afraid that the gap would affect his ability to negotiate.  He had to make it extremely clear to the employer that he decided to take the break on his own, that he had many options, and that he had plenty of money to sit on to continue his search. \n\n* The money set aside for his search was finite, but he needed hiring managers to know he wasn't desperate. \n\n* John thinks job changes during the pandemic will not be something people bat an eyelash at moving forward. \n\n## 35:51 - Career Flexibility and Parting Thoughts \n\n* Mike says he went through the numbers and how much the family paid each month, how much was set aside for their deck project, and determined how many months they could go without getting to a desperation point. \n\n* Keeping finances in order creates the flexibility.  Even if you are working at a great company, you don't know what might change. \n\n* If your lifestyle increases with every raise you will have no margin for error. \n\n* People might have an emergency fund or a dream fund, and sometimes the dream becomes taking a 6 month sabbatical.  Only financial cushion allows for this. \n\n* There are different levels of a bad situation.  The financial cushion can enable career flexibility if needed. \n\n* Mike is blessed in that he and his wife think of money the same way.  They definitely spent a lot of time building wealth. \n\n* Mike wishes he had been told early on to max out his 401K and other advice.  He got carried away with credit cards, for example.  Lucky for him he was able to work overtime and pay this off before getting married. \n\n* Mike wishes he had been saving earlier in life.  But since that debt payoff before getting married, Mike has continued to think through how to save and how to create the rainy day fund. \n\n* Some people say you need 6 months of money sitting around just in case to be paid for any sort of emergency. \n\n* Mike's advice would be talk to a financial advisor as to how best to do this to get to the money easily but also so it is protected. \n\n* When Mike and his wife got married, his wife had investments at Edward Jones. \n\n* They went to have some conversations with the local Edward Jones agent, who they still use today. \n\n* Mike used to only contribute to his 401K what the company would match, but he was not maxing it out. \n\n* One of Mike's new colleagues is super into stocks and leveraging them for buy, sell, and many other options and educated Mike.  This person has a higher risk tolerance than Mike. \n\n* Mike recommends finding a resource like somoene at Edward Jones or doing the research yourself.  \n\n* John says [Personal Finance for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/Personal-Finance-Dummies-Eric-Tyson/dp/1119517893/) helped him a great deal.  He thinks a book like that or something similar is helpful.   \n\n* John also had parents who taught him how to manage money, but that isn't everyone. \n\n* It feels like we've only scratched the surface on Mike's career experience.  We need to have him back at a future time to go deeper on some of his transitions. \n\n* If you're considering a sabbatical, make sure to take the time to think it through!   \n\n* Don't treat it as a big vacation.  Going into it you need to know what your goals for it are. \n\n* You can find Mike on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikewo/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikewo). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-17":{"title":"Episode 17","content":"\n# Episode 17\n\nTopic -

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of an interview with Joe Chenevey, detailing Joe's experience in the Air Force, how this shaped his civilian career, and how curiosity and clear communication can help us find new opportunities.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-19-2022 \n\nTopics – Meet [[Joe Chenevey]], Path to the #Military, Officer Training, Curiosity, The Civilian's Career, Signaling What You Want, #GettingPromoted    \n\n=========================== \n\n## 00:02 - Meet [[Joe Chenevey]] \n\n* [Joe Chenevey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlchenevey/) is a Principal Solutions Architect on the Dell Synergy Acceleration Team at #VMware and has served in that capacity for the last 4-5 years. You can follow him on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/sojoerner). \n\n* Joe is also part of the Global Field #Principal community at VMware.   \n\n* Joe began as part of a program within the Office of the CTO (called the CTO Ambassador program), acting as a bridge between the field (individual contributors at VMware who work in a pre-sales / post-sales capacity) and the research and development teams inside the company.  He graduated to the Global Field Principal program in 2021. \n\n* If you're curious to learn more about the global field and industry program inside VMware, check out [this blog](https://octo.vmware.com/author/global-field-principals).  \n\n## 3:58 - Path to the Military \n\n* Joe's father was in the military. \n\n* Joe understood the military way of life and led him on his own path to join the military primarily as a way to get into college. \n\n* It was easy to make the jump from being a military kid to being in the military himself. \n\n* Many people end up joining the military for similar reasons (to fund their education).   \n\n* Joe says it is an excellent way to see the world, grow your skill set, and find your journey as a person. \n\n* Joe was always technically skilled, gravitating toward technology as a student. \n\n* Joe worked a lot on computers in high school and got a ROTC scholarship from the Air Force for electrical engineering at [LMU](https://www.linkedin.com/school/loyola-marymount-university/). \n\n* His path toward the military was through ROTC.  Joe graduated college and went to officer training.  After that he did communications and computer systems for the Air Force. \n\n* Joe had applied for a scholarship in electrical engineering, and that is what he studied (even though he is not an electrical engineer today). \n\n* After graduating, through ROTC he was able to choose his top 3 career fields (satellite communications, flight test engineering, and one other…which was not communications and computer systems). \n\n* Because Joe had an electrical engineering degree and had taken some courses in communications, it turns out the Air Force had a need in communications and computer systems where they felt he would be a good fit. \n\n* Joe decided to let his experience in the assigned role over time determine whether he liked it. \n\n* Joe had done an internship at NASA working on computer systems.  It was IT even though he didn't necessarily call it that, and he enjoyed the work. \n\n* Upon originally starting Joe wanted to do more of the telecommunications side.  He realized when he got into training that the work would utilize a lot of what he had learned in communications and extend it. \n\n* Joe was stationed in Oklahoma at Tinker Air Force Base, working in a wing of the Air Force that focused on deploying IT systems for the greater Air Force. \n\n* It gave him a great background for his civilian career in IT.   \n\n* Even though it was not necessarily his first choice of role, because he was in the right place at the right time, Joe had a skill that matched the Air Force's need (which ended up working quite well).  \n\n## 9:52 - Officer Training \n\n* The training was kind of intermediate.  The positions officers are given are primarily on the leadership side (managing a program, etc.). \n\n* Joe had taken some leadership courses in his Air Force ROTC course work. \n\n* He went into 6 months of training on the basics of what his job would be.  It was focused on planning and white collar style IT leadership, but there were also some very technical elements. \n\n* Joe was given an overview of the types of systems the Air Force used and the skills needed to do the job. \n\n* It was the on the job training that made it real.  That is where the rubber met the tarmac.   \n\n* When Joe began the work, he was overseeing a program where vendors would be doing program and systems implementations, specifically responsible for overseeing the testing. \n\n* Joe also looked at high level system requirements coming from the Pentagon, from a base, or from the communications department.  He would look at vendor solutions out there and make a recommendation. \n\n* Joe was in the Air Force for 4 years.  Though not a lengthy career, it was adventurous for the time he spent in it. \n\n* Joe later got into implementations in the communications and computer systems field, which led him to start thinking about what might be next in his career. \n\n* Joe had decided early on that his time in the Air Force would not be a long term thing. \n\n* In some of his work, he had the chance to collaborate with outside vendors like [EDS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/electronic-data-systems/). \n\n* EDS did much of the contract work for the Air Force, providing the IT systems and manpower to implement them.  There were also other contractors like Lockheed Martin. \n\n* This collaboration got Joe to thinking that he could continue working in IT long term after exiting the Air Force. \n\n* Joe had no direct reports during his time as an officer but performed more [matrix management](https://gocardless.com/en-us/guides/posts/matrix-management/) duties. \n\n* You can be an officer and not necessarily have enlisted members report to you. \n\n* Joe would collaborate with and sometimes matrix manage individuals. \n\n* There were a number of communications and computer systems officers within the Air Force, and the delineation of duties depended on the organization to which you belonged. \n\n* Joe's job was an IT job but on the planning side (so an officer role) and then a lot of implementation (hands on work) was given to enlisted members. \n\n* Many of those same enlisted members who, like Joe, transitioned to civilian work had an equal opportunity in the IT field regardless of their status of not being an officer. \n\n* When Joe transitioned out of the Air Force, it didn't matter that he was an officer.  It was about the skills he had learned while in the Air Force. \n\n## 17:23 - Curiosity \n\n* People in many career fields have the chance to collaborate with vendors, tech support, consultants, and others within the same company and the ability to learn from them. \n\n* This collaboration with others made Joe curious.  He would only work with some of these people for a few weeks, but he started asking questions. \n\n* What do you do day in and day out? \n\n* How do you like your company? \n\n* What is the environment like? \n\n* These kinds of conversations in any career can lead to doors opening and new opportunities. \n\n* Joe was able to share with his contacts that he was ready to transition out of the Air Force. \n\n* Joe sent an e-mail to someone he knew from EDS that was able to put him in touch with the right people in recruitment, which led to an interview and getting a job there.  Joe already knew EDS would be a good fit for him from those early conversations and being curious. \n\n* Joe has used this curiosity throughout his career and encourages us all to do the same. \n\n* Try to understand what other people do so you can relate.  Really listen to what they are saying. \n\n* Focus on the success of others.  They will have a tendency to want to help you back at some point. \n\n* If you're not asking what other people do / curious about it, you may not realize it could be a possible career path for you. \n\n* The curiosity forces you to look up a little (since we often times can get tunnel vision). \n\n* Just having a conversation presents everyone the opportunity to see the landscape in front of them.   \n\n* Sometimes we get into a situation where we may not be satisfied with what we are doing because we want to grow.  It’s these conversations with others that allow you to reflect back on whether you are ready to make a transition into something else. \n\n## 21:19 - The Civilian's Career \n\n* When you serve in the military it is not a job but a way of life (an adage). Joe says this is very true. \n\n* You may only wear a uniform for a portion of the day, but you live and breathe the military. \n\n* As a kid Joe and his family supported his father in his career. \n\n* In many respects the military is a culture in and of itself.  It is insular in the fact that many folks rely on you and you rely on them.   \n\n* Transitioning out of the military and out of that mindset can be difficult. \n\n* For Joe, he knew he did not want a long term military career, making it a little bit easier to transition. \n\n* As an officer, he was required to make a 4 year commitment to the Air Force, and that was the exact length of his time served. \n\n* After about 2 years in, Joe realized he wanted to do something different.   \n\n* For those who choose to stay in longer, the culture / military way of life is ingrained in you more deeply. \n\n* Most if not all of your friends may be in the military. \n\n* Your children have grown up in the military. \n\n* Part of what Joe does now at VMware is to help those transitioning out of the military think through what a civilian career might look like. \n\n* As a company, VMware has a large focus on diversity and inclusion.  This includes our global veterans.   \n\n* Military folks bring a great skill set to any job (in technology or otherwise). \n\n* Joe feels he got to where he is today because of skills learned in the military. \n\n* Joe is part of the [power of difference community](https://www.vmware.com/company/diversity/building-communities.html) for veterans and spends his time helping other veterans figure out how to leverage their skills. \n\n* Remember skills in technology are not required to work in a technology field. \n\n* Many companies (not just technology companies) are trying to make it easier on veterans to get jobs after service. \n\n* It's about utilizing the adaptability of those who have served in the military (regardless of the person's specific job while in the military - cook, wellness services, IT systems, security, etc.). \n\n* Personnel in the military are trained to be adaptable to their circumstances and situationally aware. \n\n* Joe encourages those with military experience to talk about their experiences in the military, how they adapted to new situations, learned new skills, and put them into practice. \n\n* Joe gives the example of someone who was a military lawyer and then interviewed for a position at VMware with no experience in the technology field.     \n\n* Technology companies and many others are recognizing the talents of those who have military experience. \n\n* We don't always know what we should highlight on our resume to meet the requirements in a job description. \n\n* Likely no hiring manager would frown on adaptability as a skill.  The job description for a role you accept today will likely change over time. \n\n* One of the first things maybe we should try to do is see what we have done over the course of our careers across different companies and highlight the stories for the conversation with the hiring manager (ways we can use relatable skills from before in what we are asking to do next). \n\n* This can come in handy when we're ready to signal to someone that we are ready to do something different.  It may be someone outside our organization within the same company or at a totally different organization. \n\n* The career comes down to building relationships that aren't just unilateral.  They should be beneficial to both parties and can lead to doors opening which may not have been open earlier in your career. \n\n## 31:29 - Signaling What You Want \n\n* While in the military, Joe had signaled to some people at EDS that he wanted to make a change.  Should we pursue this before speaking to our manager about wanting a change? \n\n* Likely this is a smart course of action. \n\n* Joe has been fortunate to have good managers which enabled career conversations.  It was also in Joe's nature to be more candid in his conversations, and he did not hesitate to signal he was ready to do something different. \n\n* Joe had a number of supportive managers who would start the career conversations with their direct reports, who were comfortable having the conversation, accepted it, and would enable their employees' progression.   \n\n* This often comes down to company culture and the company support of people making lateral moves or otherwise progressing within the company. \n\n* Every organization goes through change.  Even after 6 months, things can change on the team, a person's responsibilities, or there can be change in company direction.   \n\n* No one really tells us this.  Joe says it behooves us to begin having career conversations with our management.  \n\n* It sets expectations as to what will make us happy and how we can be a benefit to our management. \n\n* There are a number of positions Joe would not even have known about if he didn't tell his manager he was ready for a change. \n\n* Maybe there's a good interview question here.  How has what you do today changed since you joined the company, and how have you dealt with those changes? \n\n* In a normal interview we're asked a number of questions about ourselves, and we should always ask questions to try and find out what the company where we want to work is really like. \n\n* If I want to get to a certain step in 3 years, what does that process look like? \n\n* The answer that comes back can be telling in terms of company culture and their ability to foster your career once you get there. \n\n* There are jobs we know are transitional / temporary.  There are others that appear a certain way on the outside but aren't what we thought once we get there (as far as culture goes). \n\n* It comes down to asking questions when you're ready and signaling what you want from your career.  As much as you can have those conversations and be comfortable having them the better off you will be. \n\n* Those new to people management may not be used to this approach, but if you are comfortable having the conversation, it benefits both you and your company. \n\n* Nick references the \"informational\" interviews recent guest Mike Wood had with Microsoft from [Episode 169](https://nerd-journey.com/a-thoughtful-personal-sabbatical-with-mike-wood-2-2/) (see also [Episode 168](https://nerd-journey.com/hired-and-acquired-with-mike-wood-1-2/) for the first part of Mike's story). [[Episode 168]] [[Episode 169]]\n\n* Nick suggests we as individual contributors may not realize how much change to what our job is over time has taken place until we try to convey our role to someone wanting more information (i.e. the informational setting). \n\n* Over the course of years of a career, each of us has experienced a lot of change.  You have to fundamentally step back and look at those things.  Having a conversation with someone forces that reflection. \n\n* We can have the same title for many years, but what we do on a daily basis will be different from year to year.  The organization where we work will have different priorities from year to year, which often times requires us to adjust our focus, our skills, etc.   \n\n* This gives us the opportunity to reflect on whether the change still aligns with our [[Career Goals]]. \n\n* Be mindful and cautious here.  When we are not aligned to what our companies want or the role we are in needs and want to do something different, it may be time to have those career transition conversations. \n\n## 38:40 - Getting Promoted \n\n* We often lose sight of how our management chain operates and their full purview.   \n\n* Depending on organization size, a front line manager could manage 7-15 individual contributors, which means they will have 7-15 career conversations.   \n\n* The manager is not always focused just on us (one person).  They focus on our careers, our peers' careers, and also have requirements for their leaders. \n\n* Joe gives managers credit for having to balance many needs - putting enough attention on individual staff working under them as well as making sure the team you are leading is contributing to organizational success metrics. \n\n* It's a balancing act that leaders have to do, which means that we are not the 1st 2nd, or 3rd things always on their minds. \n\n* It's up to us to signal the type of conversation we want to have, when we want to have it, and give our managers some indication of our expectations.  Then they can work with us. \n\n* An individual contributor may be focused on their own success.  Managers are focused on a team's success as well as their own success. \n\n* There's nothing worse than expecting something from leadership, making assumptions, and not getting what you wanted.  Anger is the result of unmet expectations. \n\n* This is especially true when it comes to promotions. \n\n* Joe didn't start having conversations about career progression at VMware until he was 3 years into his tenure.  It took him until then to really get into the work, look up, and see whether he was really ready to do something different. \n\n* Joe was having a great deal of fun and learning a lot, but he ultimately got to the point of wondering what might be next (needing something new).   \n\n* He learned by observation that some of his teammates progressed, but Joe wasn't approached by his leader to be promoted.   \n\n* Joe initiated the conversation about being promoted.  Then he and his manager had monthly 1-1s on how Joe could progress.  Much of it, as Joe learned, would be his work to do. And it wasn't something he understood well until going through it. \n\n* Despite having a good understanding of the structured career progression in the Air Force from his time there, Joe had no idea how civilian career progression worked. \n\n* When Joe was at [EDS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/electronic-data-systems/), instead of being promoted within a single job, he had the tendency to move around into different jobs within the company (not really a promotion). \n\n* After coming to VMware, he liked what he was doing as an Architect and wanted to know how to get to the next level of that role.  It took Joe being focused and interested in having the chat with his manager to really understand the process. \n\n* Smaller companies may not have job leveling spelled out in a clear way. \n\n* This could boil down to how long the company has been in existence and how large it has become.  Organizationally, the larger a company is in terms of number of employees, there is a tendency to have more structure in their career laddering. \n\n* When Joe came to VMware there were probably about 8,000 employees.  As of the recording of this show there are closer to 35,000 - 40,000 employees, and the company looks at job families and career ladders in a different way. \n\n* There is a different challenge and a different opportunity depending on the size of the company.  For example, Joe worked for Accenture for about 18 months before joining VMware. \n\n* At that point in time, Accenture had 160,000 employees worldwide.  The job families had to be very well organized. \n\n* VMware was the smallest company Joe had ever worked for (less than 8000 employees).  The Air Force and EDS were probably around 120,000 total in their respective personnel counts.  After EDS was acquired by HP Enterprise, it was even larger. \n\n* With lots of structure means lots of levels of ladder to climb. \n\n* You won't know how well defined things really are until you start to ask questions. \n\n* At the time of this recording, the technology space is a hot job market with talent shortages. \n\n* If you are good at your job, companies don't want to lose you. \n\n* Hopefully smaller organizations are doing more to retain talent.  Sometimes the level of progression you want does not exist at your current company. \n\n* Joe is a huge proponent of looking at lateral roles.  He has taken a number of lateral transitions into roles that were not quite related to what he had previously done.  Joe was curious, and he had a desire to learn something different.  \n\n* Each of the roles has been additive to his skillset and body of work.  He's used things learned from these experiences. \n\n* Maybe enough people do not consider these opportunities.  There are many areas of our current employers that may have new roles which could fit our desire to do something different. \n\n* Joe has changed roles at VMware during his tenure.  He also changed roles within EDS several times - category management (inside the global procurement organization), project management (matrix management of engineering resources),  program management, and getting back to technical architecture. \n\n* These opportunities were afforded to Joe because he asked for them. \n\n* See also [Episode 45](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-045-career-conversations-with-your-manager/) on career conversations with your manager and [Episode 13](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-013-the-sniper-approach-to-job-hunting-with-tom-delicati/) with Tom Delicati as mentioned in the outro for additional help. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-171":{"title":"Episode 171","content":"\n# Episode 171\n\nWelcome to episode 171 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

Time for Something New \n\n* How can we determine when it might be time to go and do something new? \n\n* Sit back and gain perspective on your level of happiness.  Happiness drives much of the decision making we do.  \n\n* Whether you are mentally curious and emotionally fulfilled contributes to how we view our professional roles and functions.  As much as we want to separate personal and professional life, people do not always appreciate how much our professional careers contribute to emotional fulfillment. \n\n* If you do not feel fulfilled, it can spill over and affect your family or your attitude toward your work. \n\n* When you're curious about something different or frustrated about what you are doing, those are there times to consider an opportunity to do something different.  \n\n* Consider the skills you have and those you want to learn.  Is there a place within your company that would leverage what you bring to the table and have a need for someone like yourself to go into the role. \n\n* In Joe's experience, personal relationships (building and maintaining them) have played a large part in being presented with the next opportunity.  Many times a conversation with someone he once worked with presented him with a new opportunity. \n\n* We should keep those personal connections warm.  Maintaining relationships takes effort and must be directional. \n\n* If we're relating to people we work with, there are many circumstances where we build relationships with people who really stuck out for one reason or another.  It's those people you really want to curate throughout your career (i.e. check in and see how they are doing).  Those relationships will often times act as bridges to something new and unique.   \n\n* This is about caring for people.  The bonds have a tendency to be fruitful by providing new insight in conversation. \n\n* Joe has mentors he's leveraged for discussing ideas, anxieties, and frustrations.  If we can do this throughout our career (however long it ends up being), even people we haven't worked with in a very long time will remember you for the positivity you brought.  They will still be there and could be the very ones who lead you into a new opportunity. \n\n* We live in a world that is very small in technology.  Continue to curate the relationships that you can leverage when you're ready to do something more than you are doing today. \n\n## 9:13 - The Mentor's Role \n\n* Some of Joe's mentors were previous front line managers he worked under which he continued to use as mentors (bouncing ideas, asking about areas of the company). \n\n* Mentors can provide a perspective that you don't have.  They can see the good we're doing which we do not see ourselves and provide transparent feedback into areas where we need to grow which we may not be thinking of. \n\n* Mentoring does not always have to be formal as to what the relationships look like.  Some of Joe's mentors have been peers, and some have been leaders.   \n\n* It depends on your focus as an individual.  Sometimes good mentors can be those who are doing things we are interested in doing.  There are also folks who have been successful in career progression that we might use as a sounding board for our own career progression. \n\n* Mentors can help us think through career decisions as well as be narrowly focused on helping us build a specific skill that will unlock new opportunities for us. \n\n* Mentors can also guide us in how to have career conversations with our manager. \n\n* It's often easier to have that conversation with mentors instead of your front line manager.  They can help you approach it the right way. \n\n* Whatever a mentor shares as far as how they did something, take it with a grain of salt because that experience was unique to them.   \n\n* Joe often tells mentees, \"in your situation, you may consider X, Y, Z.\"  And when sharing his experience, he makes sure to communicate it was the path he chose based on his circumstances.  The suggestions he provides mentees is meant to let the person think through what will be most comfortable to them. \n\n* The mentor can act as a sounding board that decreases anxiety.  There's no pressure on them and none on you. \n\n## 13:37 - Reacting to Feedback \n\n* What if the boss is not receptive to what you want (i.e. a promotion / specific role on the team) even after practicing with a mentor? \n\n* It largely depends on how satisfied you are in what you are doing today. \n\n* Keep in mind the manager you are speaking to is a human being.  This has taken Joe years to learn. \n\n* Trying to understand your manager's perspective a little better also helps.  When the answer you wanted to hear does not come to you, this might allow you to take the answer differently. \n\n* If you're not satisfied with the feedback from a conversation with the boss, it is time to assess your situation.  Ask yourself… \n\n* Do I need to build additional skills?  (a great follow up question for the boss) \n\n* If the opportunity does not present itself now, when do we anticipate it coming up? (another good question to ask) \n\n* You also have the option to pause the conversation with your manager, do your own assessment, and talk to a coach or a mentor to reflect. \n\n* Perhaps the answer is that the opportunity is not there in your current team / role, and now may be the time to transition. \n\n* You could ask your boss what the gaps are.  Perhaps you and a mentor did not see them as the boss does. \n\n* In many cases Joe likes to use mentors outside of his organization within the company. \n\n* They have a different perspective. \n\n* There are not necessarily privy to what you do on a daily basis like your direct manager, peer, or skip level manager might. \n\n* Taking input from multiple viewpoints is helpful, especially when we're looking to transition to a role different from the one we are in now. Having multiple voices can help us make a decision. \n\n* Once you come to a conclusion on the next progression step for you, if it does not exist within your organization, go and have that conversation with your manager about helping you find what you want within the company. \n\n* No one should have the expectation you will do the same thing you do now for 20 years. \n\n* Being ready to have that conversation is easier once we have determined how far we can take ourselves in our current job code / job family.  \n\n* It can be difficult, especially when we like the company and the people who work with us. It becomes a choice between stay within the company or go to a place that has the opportunity you want. \n\n* It all goes back to how satisfied you are in what you do when it's time to make a decision. \n\n## 18:05 - Layers of Management \n\n* Joe has considered people leadership previously both at VMware and at his previous employers.   \n\n* It came down to satisfaction with what he was doing. \n\n* When he looked at people management earlier in his career, he looked at it as a natural progression step (a misinformed opinion).   \n\n* After researching specific roles in people management and understood the characteristics the company was looking for, they did not align with Joe's passion areas. \n\n* When you're not passionate about something you don't necessarily put your best foot forward. \n\n* Joe was not passionate about having to manage cost centers and other administrative tasks. \n\n* Your level of enthusiasm for the work at hand portends how successful you can be when you want to interview for that type of role. \n\n* Joe found he was more enthusiastic about the technology than anything else and found people management to not be for him at that time. \n\n* Staying an individual contributor allowed Joe to control his area of focus within technology and the types of things he focused on without taking on the burden to think about salaries and career progression of direct reports (and other daily duties of a manager). \n\n* Joe sees himself as a hard core technology, and that is where his interest is.  \n\n* Over time your view point on staying individual contributor or pursuing leadership can shift. \n\n* Do you still feel passionate about the technology? \n\n* Are you looking to build other people up? \n\n* People who step into management roles are looking to build and curate people? \n\n* Over time Joe has focused more on mentorship and coaching.  His mind is more receptive to eventually taking a management role because he is looking at being more of a coach and mentor as opposed to the person doing the actual work. \n\n* It goes back to your level of happiness.   \n\n## 23:35 - Managing Programs and Projects \n\n* Program and project management is a career field in an of itself, which includes managing an organization made up of resources and assets in order to accomplish building something. \n\n* Program managers and project managers are facilitating schedules, resources, and assets to create a deliverable (a building, an IT project, etc.).  These people are not managers themselves but have to manage resources and assets. \n\n* One of the resources happens to be humans (engineering talent, operational talent, etc.).  You get into influencing the work of other people and scheduling the resources, working with managers, etc. \n\n* The focus is on the level of work and the type of work without the responsibility for managing individual career paths. \n\n* There is a fine line because the resources whose work you need to manage do not report to you, and influencing must be done indirectly and in various ways. \n\n* Matrix management is often what program manager and project managers do (trying to get human resources to do something / build something on behalf of the company). \n\n* In many cases, we as technologists need someone to organize work into finite tasks to accomplish on a schedule. \n\n* Joe got into roles like this to do something different than just technical implementation.   \n\n* Joe was bored at the time and had taken some program management training while in the Air Force, feeling it was something he could utilize.  \n\n* That training taught him how to influence people.  When he was in a program management role he had to control costs, schedules, and the quality of the work while not necessarily having authoritative control over any of those things. \n\n* The skills Joe learned from this type of role were very helpful, but the role itself was also a frustration point that contributed to his later transition back to a role focused on technical architecture. \n\n* If you work for a small company and are highly organized, changes are you have done project management type tasks without even realizing it. \n\n* Maybe this is an adjacency that could be an option for you if looking to do something different. \n\n* Project and program management are career fields in and of themselves regardless of whether it applies to IT. \n\n* The same methodology a project manager in construction applies in IT and many other industries as well. \n\n* This is the great thing about learning new skill sets and soft skills (project management, financial management, etc.) as they can lead to new opportunities inside your company or outside. \n\n## 29:11 - The Way of the Principal \n\n* The principal title is highly regarded and somewhat elite across our industry for individual contributors.   \n\n* The principal title can mean different things depending upon the company.  Largely it is consistent with one of the higher tier technologist roles across our industry. \n\n* In many respects achieving the principal status requires specialization in a context that you're building your platform and becoming known for something unique and differentiated as opposed to the majority of your colleagues. \n\n* Taking pre-sales solution engineering as an example, there are many potential areas of focus.  To go to the principal level, it becomes a matter of becoming known for a certain technical skill set or body of work. \n\n* Joe started to build a specialization when he joined the Dell synergy part of the organization and becoming an expert in joint Dell and VMware solutions.  He also started building relationships within the Office of the CTO while serving as a CTO Ambassador. \n\n* This led Joe to wonder if he was ready to take the next step and go for principal. \n\n* In many companies there is a structured process to get to that level. \n\n* Once again it was up to Joe to signal what he wanted to do and then find a coach who could help me think through the necessary steps to prepare to go through the process. \n\n* Graduating from a generalist to becoming a specialist is pretty much required as it takes a finite focus to really build up your credibility.  Joe, for example, has a tendency to be brought in to discuss joint solution sets. \n\n* Looking at other field principals he knows, Joe mentions each one has built up their skillset and become known in and for a specific thing / area. \n\n* Regardless of your company, the principal title is for a very differentiated skill set for a unique area where the company is focused. \n\n* It can come down to technical depth and building a broad swath of soft skills as part of a greater body of work.  It's almost like explaining to someone else how you've attained that level and why you deserve that distinction. \n\n* It took Joe a while to understand what the process was to get to the principal level.  He had to be curious about it first.  \n\n* Define a specialization, and work to make yourself known for it. \n\n* Is the road to principal paved with even more work than you're doing now?   \n\n* It comes down to time management.  If there is something you want to do you will find time to do it.   \n\n* In many cases when Joe chose to go down the principal path he had to figure out how to find the time for it.  Joe tried to align preparation for principal with his daily work. \n\n* The more those two things align the easier it will be for you to make that progression. \n\n* You will need more time than 40 hours per week.  Joe had to dedicate some personal time to his principal preparation. \n\n* For the period of time he was going through preparation for principal, it did take away from Joe's family time. \n\n* People looking at career progression during a promotion phase are likely going to have to put forth extra effort which has to be balanced with your personal needs as well as those of your family. \n\n* Be prepared to find time outside of your day job to make that progression happen.  Maybe it's ok to flex yourself for a little while and then take some time off. \n\n* Joe had some early conversations with his management chain about his participation in the global field program, which provided him some air cover. \n\n* Joe had relayed the benefits of his participation in this program to his team and his management (the internal organization he worked within). \n\n* If you're looking at a promotion (whether principal or not), your ability to explain why it is beneficial to your organization that you work toward that promotion really helps provide the justification for spending the time and reserving some of your day hours for it. \n\n* Joe had to sell it to his management, and they were supportive of the time he needed. \n\n* We have to be known and distinguished for something.  Joe spent time gaining expertise in the Dell solution set so that if someone inside the Office of the CTO needed a resource to speak on joint Dell and VMware solutions they would automatically think of him. \n\n* This takes a lot of work and time.  It takes gaining visibility within your organization as well so that someone will associate expertise in a specific area with you. \n\n* And once they do associate the two, seeing that you have the ability to go very deep in one area, new opportunities may present themselves to repeat that level of depth in another area. \n\n## 41:13 - Parting Thoughts and What's Next \n\n* The higher you go into your career (i.e. further up the career ladder as an individual contributor), there is a lot of focus at the highest levels on building up others. \n\n* Joe does not think he would have progressed to his current level without people who were able to coach him along the way (others who had walked the same progression path to principal). \n\n* Joe's curiosity led to him asking questions and getting feedback on what he could do to fill the gaps. \n\n* Now he spends time coaching people 1-1 who seek to follow the same path, providing suggestions on the mindset shift that must happen in taking the next steps. \n\n* It becomes curating and fostering mindsets day in and day out for customers, partners, product teams, and those more junior than yourself within the company. \n\n* What's next for Joe Chenevey? \n\n* Joe has to have periods of time for reflection throughout the year.  Everyone should consider taking time just for this to determine mental health, emotional health, and what we feel about our work / life balance. \n\n* It's challenging in technology to frame work life balance.  Joe derives a lot of emotional fulfillment from what he does daily as a professional in the industry.   \n\n* Joe feels when in the mode of personal reflection, it gives him a good perspective on overall job satisfaction. \n\n* Am I happy doing what I am doing? \n\n* Do I like what I do? \n\n* Am I ready for something different? \n\n* Am I ready for the next step (whatever that is)? \n\n* After asking himself questions like the ones above, Joe will seek a sounding board (a coach or mentor) and at some point communicating to his leadership. \n\n* The technologist must constantly evaluate where they fit in the industry, and these periods of reflection allow Joe to do just that. \n\n* You can follow Joe on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/sojoerner). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-172":{"title":"Episode 172","content":"\n# Episode 172\n\nWelcome to episode 172 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of an interview with Evan Oldford, talking through his early career as an intern, a software engineer, life through acquisition, and a transition into people leadership and escalation management. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-21-2022 \n\nTopics – Meet Evan Oldford, Internships, Full-Time Employment and Moving on, Break into Software Engineering, People Leadership and Learning, Thoughts on Acquisition, Escalation Management as a Role and General Tips for All, Managing Stress through Daily Practice [[Evan Oldford]] #Cisco \n\n=========================== \n\n## 02:51 - Meet Evan Oldford \n\n* [Evan Oldford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eoldford/) is a Senior Director at Cisco Systems of an Escalations group.  His engineering team takes issues from support into engineering and they focus on restoring service for customers in the security domain. \n\n* People don't always know what we mean when we say engineering as it relates to a software company.  We did interview [[Mike Wood]] in [Episode 168](https://nerd-journey.com/hired-and-acquired-with-mike-wood-1-2/) and [Episode 169](https://nerd-journey.com/a-thoughtful-personal-sabbatical-with-mike-wood-2-2/) to discuss his experience in software engineering.  [[Episode 168]] [[Episode 169]]\n\n* Evan's interest in software development date back to college days in the mid / late 1990s when he got his first distribution of Linux and tried to install it, slowly proceeding down the rabbit hole of learning. \n\n* He later got into shell scripting in one of his courses. \n\n* Evan was an economics major who minored in computer science. \n\n## 04:45 - Internships \n\n* During college he picked up two internships. \n\n* One of the internships was for [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) doing some preliminary development on [Netscape Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Application_Server) (before the [Netscape Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) browser launched). \n\n* The next summer, he found an internship in the newspaper that also  helped set him on this path into software development. \n\n* Evan survived the .com boom and bust and got to see the proliferation of how fast things were changing on the internet \n\n* We mentioned Mike Wood got in on the early days of the .NET framework and Visual Studio.  Evan veered more toward the scripting side, things like [Bourne shell](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=shells-bourne-shell), [Perl](https://www.perl.org/), and eventually C and some others. \n\n* Even liked to have a book in one hand, a keyboard in another, and sometimes a debugger…it was trial and error learning. \n\n* This fast feedback is what we might classify as deliberate practice. For example, Evan encourages programming \"Hello, World!\" in as many languages as you can. \n\n* Evan did an internship at Whistle Communication.  Think of it as an all-in-one (web server, e-mail server, firewall server) solution. \n\n* A VP at the company encouraged Evan to quit school, but Evan was not ready to do that.  College is where he met his wife. \n\n* Evan worked for Whistle over the course of a couple of summers and was able to shadow some extremely smart engineers, learning a lot by looking over the shoulder of others. \n\n* After graduation, Evan went to his boss from the Whistle days and let him know about graduating.  The former boss was uncharacteristically quiet.  It turns out Whistle was going through a period of being acquired by IBM. \n\n* After about six months, the previous boss hired Evan in the division of IBM that Whistle became. \n\n* Nick points out the decision to continue working and quit school vs. the hybrid approach is a tough one.  He mentions seeing Reddit threads quite frequently from people who aren't sure what to study in school and wondering if they should enter the workforce. \n\n* Evan's philosophy is he went to school for an education.  He majored in economics but also gained experience with computers (programming, which seemed like a sure thing).  That provided a different perspective.  He liked the technical part but also got an education while he was at it.  \n\n* Many people don't fully leverage what they learned in school working toward a degree.  Test, dabble, and learn as much as you can. \n\n* For the career side, find something that is interesting, and this usually sets you on a good path forward to soak up new experiences.   \n\n* Don't get too wrapped up trying to pick the perfect major.  Go and try and bunch of different things. \n\n* In Evan's case, this was a paid internship.  He says it was very generous and way better than delivering papers, for example. \n\n* Internships are often underrated.  You don't need to know what you want your eventual profession to be.  There is freedom to try things. \n\n* Evan wishes more people did more internships and didn't reserve it just for college.  Consider the folks looking to change careers.   \n\n* During Evan's internship, his experiences dealing with seasoned engineers was intimidating. \n\n* Some are not necessarily there and invested in teaching you (as an intern).  Others, however, will be open to spending an hour to explain things in more detail.  You will probably see a little of everything. \n\n* Try and find engineers invested in letting you learn and try out things in a sandbox that isn't production.  You can learn a lot from this experience. \n\n## 12:26 - Full-Time Employment and Moving on \n\n* After getting a full time job at Whistle (a result of his internship), it was sort of a continuation of what he had been doing.   \n\n* There was a lot of prototyping and testing, which allowed full stack troubleshooting.  Evan has kept down this path throughout his career. \n\n* Nick feels like Scott Lowe, host of the [Full Stack Journey](https://packetpushers.net/series/full-stack-journey/) podcast would be smiling to hear about the full stack focus. \n\n* The focus on the full stack can in fact promote collaboration among teams. \n\n* Evan has seen software developers with a very myopic view, focused on the part of the system they touch and nothing beyond that, but this is a disservice.  There is so much more than your own feature and your own area. \n\n* Look at what is adjacent for a better view of the full stack. \n\n* Evan thinks you can flip a coin between generalist and specialist and be right on both sides. \n\n* Some will want to hyperspecialize and be the very best at one small area, only focusing there.  And there is absolutely a market for it. \n\n* There is also the generalist who wants to touch everything, and that can also work very well.   \n\n* It depends on how you want to scratch the itch and what feeds your interest. \n\n* Generally speaking, there is more demand than supply, which allows you to find a home. \n\n* This was around the time when [802.11 wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11) was becoming much more popular. \n\n* Evan moved from Whistle to a software vendor (Vernier Networks) that was focused on mobility and wireless.  There were some engineers who previously worked at Whistle who helped Evan transition.   \n\n* It was a great learning experience.  He was able to get deeper into the systems. \n\n* Shortly after this, the manager who had hired Evan into Whistle previously (and his manager for the aforementioned internship) was working for a startup that did e-mail (IronPort Systems), had an opening, and asked Evan to come in for an interview. \n\n* Evan had e-mail experience, which was a plus.  The role was an Application Engineer, but effectively the role was to troubleshoot the system (which was based on [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/)). \n\n* [IronPort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronPort) was a few years later acquired by [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/). \n\n## 16:44 - Break into Software Engineering \n\n* The tools these days such as [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (integrated development environments) make it easier to know syntax for various programming languages. \n\n* Start with something that is interesting to you.  With open source software, you can get visibility into all kinds of really interesting areas. \n\n* Then start breaking it down into smaller parts to figure out how it works (how eventing works, for example).  Rebuild from there. \n\n* Evan is a big fan of learning from books, specifically [O'Reilly books](https://www.oreilly.com/products/books-videos.html), and then going and doing. \n\n* Some others may prefer a more structured course curriculum.  Identify the format you prefer, and start clocking the hours to get to your [10,000 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uB5PUpGzeY). \n\n* How can those who have a love for scripting much like Evan progress into software engineers? \n\n* On the scripting side, look at the problem you are trying to solve.  If you then start unpacking some of the scripting, you will eventually run into a limitation of what the script can do. \n\n* From there, consider if it could be pulled into / rewritten in a different language.  At the time of this recording [python](https://www.python.org/) is very popular.   \n\n* Take time to learn about the strengths and advantages of this other language. \n\n* Evan suggests trying to rewrite the script in multiple other languages (maybe python and perl).   \n\n* When you do this, you will start going down the rabbit hole.  You will learn about some strengths and deficiencies of the various languages. \n\n* Pick the right tool for the job, knowing that you do not have to force everything into one specific language.  Tailor your project accordingly.  Go and try to learn more. \n\n* Evan is very impressed by just how much learning can be done just by simple Googling.  You can get some great ideas from what code is being posted. \n\n* Take these learnings and start building your portfolio line by line with different variants, techniques, and coding practices.  Build from there. \n\n* A GitHub repo or something similar with your portfolio demonstrates you are proficient and trying new things. \n\n* There are a number of open source projects where you can contribute in the form of patches, testing, and translation. \n\n* Github is nice to demonstrate something you might not be able to from your 9 to 5 job (initiative to learn something new, build up your experience in an area). \n\n* It makes individuals who have proof of ambition attractive to a hiring manager. \n\n* It also seems like learning to code has become more prevalent within the technology industry. \n\n* We may not know as IT generalists what a developer does every day, but on GitHub, for example, there is an opportunity to collaborate and learn from others who are willing to share their expertise and experience. \n\n* Sometimes you will come across others who are not so generous with their expertise.  That is ok.  You need to have thick skin in those cases. \n\n## 22:02 - People Leadership and Learning \n\n* Evan went into people leadership…a little bit by accident.  This was during his time at IronPort, and he transitioned gradually (what he feels is the best way you can). \n\n* The manager who hired Evan asked that he step into that role. \n\n* From the first day to the second day he was still doing the same things.  But it allowed him to start learning and acquiring some additional skills around what is needed.  It is definitely a mind shift. \n\n* For the previous part of his career, he was all about acquiring technology, figuring out what could go in his technology toolbox. The learning accelerated more because of this. \n\n* On the management side, Evan needed to learn what was needed to make the individuals successful. \n\n* It was an interesting transition.  Evan says people are wired differently, but it worked well for him moving into management. \n\n* Some people find that management is not their thing and they would much rather be an individual contributor. \n\n* Some individual contributors believe they can only be successful by going into management. \n\n* In reality there are two different ladders, the managerial ladder and the technical ladder.  Pick the one that is right for you. \n\n* Nick says each ladder has a different element of leadership.  Perhaps we have to decide how much of the hat to place on our heads. \n\n* You don't have to have a title to be a leader.  It comes down to the influence you have. \n\n* Whether people report to you or you are influencing through other means it is about how you are demonstrating it.  There are two ways to demonstrate leadership, and you need not be a manager to do that. \n\n* Evan says he got lucky in that he had a great manager who trusted in his abilities.  Evan's resume didn't really show that he was a potential manager. \n\n* It was sort of the stroke of a pen and there he was.   \n\n* Evan says he had a lot of learning to do. \n\n* He turned to podcasts and books of choice to help here. \n\n* The [manager tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-podcasts) and [career tools podcast](https://www.manager-tools.com/career-tools-podcasts) have been very helpful to Evan.  He's been listening since 2007. \n\n* John has referenced these podcasts a number of times on the show, and they are a great resource. \n\n* It surprises Evan that they give this content away for free. \n\n* After he started listening to the manager tools podcast, Evan started looking at others.   \n\n* He also began reading more nonfiction on leadership principles and surrounding content.  It helped Evan expand his perspective because you don't always get the chance to gain the experience needed before going into the role.  Going to books is a great way to get a perspective on a technology or idea without having the experience. \n\n* This has helped Evan learn more and really helped form his thought process over the years. \n\n* As for a reading medium, Evan says it depends.  It's going to be what works for you where you are at the time based on what you want to accomplish. \n\n* Evan listens to podcasts and Audible while doing chores around the house.   \n\n* He also has the Kindle app on his iPad and likes reading it in dark mode because it can be read at night without turning on the light, working through a number of books this way. \n\n* Evan does not like bringing the iPad to the beach and uses paper books in this case. \n\n* Evan recently read [Zone to Win](https://www.amazon.com/Zone-Win-Organizing-Compete-Disruption/dp/1682302113/) by Geoffrey Moore.  He started reading on his Kindle and then switched to the Audible version when it was time to run an errand in the car to keep going.  Using multiple mediums can work. \n\n* The Kindle app is nice because you can highlight, take notes, and export. \n\n* There is another app called [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) that allows you to check out Kindle or audiobooks from local libraries.  Even likes to take notes using this app as well. \n\n* Evan will also mark up physical copies of books with notes and highlights.  When listening to a book, content goes a little too fast.  He likes to hit pause and take a note in a Google Doc using his phone and come back to it. \n\n* Evan listened to our episodes on [[Deep Work]] ([Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/) - [Episode 147](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-7-become-hard-to-reach/)) and hasn’t quite gone to that level of dissection.  [[Episode 141]] [[Episode 147]] [[Cal Newport]]\n\n* Full credit to John White for building the notes we used for the format of episodes in the series. [[Zettelkasten|Smart Notes]]\n\n* Nick likes to take down notes in the notes app on iOS here and there to help remember the books consumed via Audible better.  \n\n* Check out Evan's list of book suggestions and his ratings [here](https://ghostrules.com/books/). \n\n* Evan got the role leading the same team he had formerly been a part of.  The company was still a very small startup.  When he joined IronPort, it was about 50 employees. \n\n* When you are a small startup everything is scrappy with most people wearing multiple hats.  Being the manager was just another hat to wear at the time, and it wasn't a big deal changing over with the team still being quite small. \n\n* Evan started with 1 direct report, and it quickly grew from there. \n\n## 30:29 - Thoughts on Acquisition \n\n* Evan works in the Security business group at Cisco today.  Ever since starting with his internships, he has been fascinated with firewalls and the underlying security of them, deciding to build his expertise there. \n\n* When Cisco acquired IronPort it was pulled into this business group, and Evan did not have to pick it himself.  Over the years he has grown in scope and influence. \n\n* It seems like Evan's experience going through acquisitions (two of them) were positive compared to other guests we've interviewed who maybe did not have the best experience. \n\n* There are lots of lessons learned going through an acquisition.  Evan finds the acquisitions that work best are when you embrace the company doing the acquiring. \n\n*  At a startup, only the culture matters.  You push away everything else.  Those may not go as well over time. \n\n* People may resent the change over time to a new company and will leave. \n\n* You can still embrace the culture and see the positives of being acquired, even if you have to hold your nose through some of it (a bit of a bureaucratic tax that comes along with this process when being acquired by a larger company). \n\n* Some folks in management positions may be concerned about being cut when being acquired by another company.   \n\n* Evan didn't have that concern so much since working within the escalations group is not a popular place for cuts to happen. \n\n* This team is able to demonstrate value on a daily basis fighting whatever fires happen to come up.  This is not typically the place where a company would look to optimize operating experience because it has been positioned to be quite valuable in the company. \n\n* This positioning of a team's work as value to an organization is something Evan backed into by accident.   \n\n* He feels he got lucky in picking a position that is aligned very well with organizational goals. \n\n* There are other positions inside a company that are more susceptible to boom and bust cycles than what Evan does (help keep the lights on). \n\n## 34:31 - Escalation Management as a Role and General Tips for All  \n\n* Maybe an escalation means something needs a higher priority than it has now? \n\n* It takes a certain character for someone to gravitate into the escalation management role. \n\n* Evan likes it.  The adrenaline rush is measured in days and weeks to come to a resolution on things. \n\n*In this role you have a good learning environment and have to solve a really tough, thorny problem once followed by working back into the system.  Then you're off again learning about the next crisis and the next new problem. \n\n* It's incredibly satisfying learning and seeing new challenges on a regular basis. \n\n* It does not feel stagnant.  You are always changing, always doing something new because you are fundamentally seeing new problems and working that into the system. \n\n* Not everyone is wired this way. Some people are long range planners that measure things in years, which is a strength. \n\n* Evan finds those who do well in the escalation engineer role are somewhat adrenaline junkies, and they like that shot in the arm daily. \n\n* Find the position for which you are wired.  Evan gravitated to this, and it has worked well for him. \n\n* Nick likes the dynamic aspect to the role and feels the ability to impact products for a company and its customers by eliminating bugs is a huge contributor to job satisfaction (i.e. feeling you are making a difference). \n\n* Not everyone has the ability to see how their work is adding impact (depends on the company, the role, etc.). \n\n* Evan's escalation team is the face of engineering.  To be able to turn a customer around and provide a resolution is incredibly satisfying.  Sometimes you will need to work with the engineers to connect the dots. \n\n* This reminds Nick of [The Three Signs of a Miserable Job](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Signs-Miserable-Job/dp/B000VA1PCG) by Patrick Lencioni. \n\n* For the technologist, managing your own escalations can come down to communication, relationships, and building trust (could be related to technology failure or something else). \n\n* Think about other relationships you are building and the way you're interacting with other parts of the organization. \n\n* In smaller companies you may not have to worry about cross-geography relationships.  It could be much smaller and easier to build relationships, but it takes work to reach out and build the virtual rolodex that is your network. \n\n* How can we keep connections warm without being overwhelmed by the work involved? \n\n* It's definitely work, and it's definitely more. \n\n* Evan has found that if you don't you will be working harder to try and accomplish the same thing.   \n\n* You may be looking to get a certain process pushed through but figuratively banging your head against an organizational wall. \n\n*  If you had a connection that was on your program management team, for example, you could give them a call to ask for help.  That will save you time but may not be apparent right now. \n\n* Make investments now that you can go back and use later. \n\n## 40:29 - Managing Stress through Daily Practice \n\n* Managing escalations does invite stress, and it can wear on you. \n\n* One thing that can help manage the stress is giving others access to information. \n\n* Evan does a daily report that goes through everything happening in the organization. \n\n* The daily report is a lot of work, but Evan has found that he sleeps really well at night.  He doesn't ruminate when his head hits the pillow. \n\n* This daily update, when deconstructed, is a form of journaling. \n\n* Evan highlights this daily report in a chapter of his book [Ghost Rules: Unspoken Secrets of Getting Ahead](https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Rules-Unspoken-secrets-getting/dp/B09JBMWNN2). \n\n* Doing the daily report increases your visibility and value add to the organization.  It also de-stresses you a bit because you are not thinking about the problems (i.e. got them out of your system). \n\n* Evan believes this is a superpower and competitive advantage over the years. \n\n* When you look at it, most people don't report enough or communicate.  This is a way to communicate, get your visibility, and de-stress all in one. \n\n* Nick likes the idea of giving someone an update before they need to ask you for one. \n\n* This also sounds similar to the daily shutdown routine Cal Newport mentions in [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B0189PVAWY). \n\n* Evan says it is his shutdown routine each day and that it was nice to see the same advice from Newport (validation that he was on the right track). \n\n* Evan's role at Cisco is incredibly flexible (a perk of working for them). \n\n* Evan likes to pop out of work each day, do dinner with the family, read with the kids, and put them to bed. \n\n* Then he comes online to wrap up the day and create the daily report to end the day.  That's his shutdown routine. \n\n* In Evan's case, he could do it by 3 PM, but he's still getting information coming in from the day until evening.  And doing it this way helps him shut things down for the day.   \n\n* The daily update needs to be somewhat brief as per the chapter on visibility through reporting in Evan's book. \n\n* Consider it as needing to be short enough to read in line to get your coffee at Starbucks. \n\n* When doing this reporting, you are usually reporting up.  The demands on people's time are high.  Distill it down to the bottom line / it's very essence up front. \n\n* Evan tries to strip out all extraneous information to get it down to the most important bits. \n\n* He struggles with this need for brevity daily (as likely many of us do). \n\n* There is so much good that goes into resolving a big problem.  You may want to outline the dynamics of the business situation or customers situation, but it is necessary to step back and ask yourself whether details being included are adding to the bottom line. \n\n* \"It is a constant practice that does not come easy…at all.\" - Evan Oldford \n\n* This is something we are all encouraged to do whether a manager or individual contributor.  There is no need to copy the world but only those who need to know. \n\n* This is a great platform for you to be able to add your own insight. \n\n* One of Evan's managers said he liked the daily update because he got smarter by reading it. \n\n* Your job with sending the daily update is to make your audience smarter, not just to call the balls and strikes that happened during the day. \n\n* Add some color commentary.  The insights you add are a great way to demonstrate that you can provide meaningful updates. \n\n* Nick had not thought about the daily update being a way to decrease stress and as a form of journaling. \n\n* Evan has listened to a number of podcasts that highlighted being mindful and journaling as a way to do it.  He thought to himself \"I should start this.\" \n\n* After thinking on it a bit, Evan realized he was already doing it (the journaling exercise he had heard so many mention, part of the daily update).  Perhaps this is why he is able to sleep so well at night. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-173":{"title":"Episode 173","content":"\n# Episode 173\n\nWelcome to episode 173 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 2 of an interview with Evan Oldford, discussing how to prioritize sleep, how to document your work, combatting perfectionism, and some insight on the genesis of Evan's book Ghost Rules. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-21-2022 \n\n[Evan Oldford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eoldford/) is a Senior Director at Cisco Systems of an Escalations group.  His engineering team takes issues from support into engineering and they focus on restoring service for customers in the security domain.  Evan is also author of [Ghost Rules: Unspoken Secrets to Getting Ahead](https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Rules-Unspoken-secrets-getting/dp/B09JBMWNN2).  [[Evan Oldford]] #Cisco [[Ghost Rules]]\n\nTopics – Importance of #Sleep, Good Enough; Bandwidth, Time, and a Routine; How to Document Your Work, Delegation and Elimination, Genesis of Ghost Rules, Parting Thoughts and What's Next \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:30 - Importance of Sleep \n\n* One of the pieces of advice Evan gives in his book is to prioritize sleep.  It seems like lack of sleep is an even bigger problem since the pandemic started with workdays for many getting longer and more meetings on the calendar. \n\n* If you want to do something you need to schedule it by putting it on your calendar.   \n\n* Evan has a block on his calendar that tells him when it's time to go to bed. \n\n* With the pandemic the lines between work and home get really blurry. Being able to set the boundaries between when you will be online and working and when you will be off can help. \n\n* There will be some tensions at times, but you can set the ground rules on where you will implement the boundaries.  You need to feel comfortable enough to be able to do this. \n\n* Of course, we need to be accessible for a large portion of our days, but the one thing you cannot compromise on is sleep. \n\n* Evan has sleep scheduled on his Outlook calendar.  Though he may not always go to bed right then, he sets the intention. \n\n* If you don't set the intention, your bedtime may be very irregular, which [according to sleep psychologist Michael Breus can negatively affect health](https://thesleepdoctor.com/sleep-hygiene/sleeping-schedule/).  Breus also wrote a very good book called [The Power of When](https://thepowerofwhen.com/). \n\n* Evan highly recommends reading [Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316) by Matthew Walker.   \n\n* It will make you want to go to bed (in a good way).  The author outlines a number of ways we sabotage our sleep. \n\n* What if it's time to go to sleep and you cannot shut your brain down? \n\n* Generally if you perform the shutdown routine we discussed earlier you don't get this feeling of rumination.  It's out of your head much like David Alan speaks to in [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) and leads to some quiet. \n\n* When Evan's mind is racing on a topic, he finds it helpful to write things down to help stop the racing. \n\n* How can the extra sleep we got make up for work left unfinished? \n\n* Evan's task list inbox never goes to zero (much like most of us). \n\n* You have to embrace that the work will be there in the morning. \n\n* There are certainly deadlines where we need to press on and power through, for example.  But generally understand there will always be more work, and work generates more work. \n\n* We need to be able to hit pause and know the work will be there the next time we are ready to do it. \n\n* Sometimes Evan will intentionally work on a technical problem right before bed, knowing he cannot solve it.   \n\n* He has found that usually first thing in the morning he will have an insight / epiphany to help get past the road block. \n\n* This is subconscious deep work happening that isn't so different from the idea of embracing boredom to let your brain continue to think on a problem.  See also [Episode 144](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-4-embracing-boredom/). \n\n* Nick finds that the times he is fighting sleep the hardest to finish something are likely the times when he needs it most.  Pressing deadlines are of course an exception (some may argue even this could have been avoided with better planning). \n\n## 8:09 - Good Enough \n\n* Something still being there tomorrow is in line with Evan's thoughts on work being \"good enough.\" \n\n* Evan (and many others) has an inner perfectionist who needs to get everything just right.   \n\n* When you look at something you need to prioritize what is most important. \n\n* Typically in a highly dynamic environment you cannot do all the work on your to-do list to the standard of perfection. \n\n* You have to figure out if, for example, an 80% solution is good enough for a situation.  Some will keep polishing over and over when something is already good enough. \n\n* But stopping at good enough gives us more bandwidth.  There are certain projects where you need to go deep and have an extremely high level of precision (i.e. a higher priority task, for example). \n\n* For a task, ask yourself what is acceptable instead of whether it is perfect.  Acknowledge that it is not perfect.  Is it acceptable?  If so, lay it aside and get on to the next thing. \n\n* Evan has seen individuals get wrapped up in the perfectionism and end up operating on a smaller body of work. \n\n* Evan recommends [The Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Shipping-Creative-Work/dp/0593328973) by Seth Godin, which highlights the difference between good enough and perfectionism.  We want to be shipping our work. \n\n* We want to ship a good volume of work and to do this need to be able to hit pause on the inner critic and be ok with it.  This allows more bandwidth for focus on deeper and more important work. \n\n* Silencing the inner perfectionist is tough.   \n\n* Sometimes if Evan sees code that is not formatted correctly he needs to reformat it (not a great use of time). \n\n* Think about the result that needs to come from a task, and consider mentality the priority level. \n\n* Is this high priority, low priority, or just confetti work? \n\n* Step back and gain that perspective to help you decide how much effort is needed. \n\n## 10:49 - Bandwidth, Time, and a Routine \n\n* There are many techniques on time management that can be utilized (like the Pomodoro Technique, for example) to divide up your time. \n\n* Check out [The Pomodoro Technique: The Acclaimed Time-Management System That Has Transformed How We Work](https://www.amazon.com/Pomodoro-Technique-Acclaimed-Time-Management-Transformed/dp/1524760706) by Francesco Cirillo \n\n* Bandwidth is more about what can be mentally accomplished during a block of time. \n\n* Think about what could be zapping your mental energy.  It could be a cognitive task.   \n\n* There is only a fixed about of energy per day, and you want to be able to exploit that bandwidth as much as possible. \n\n* One technique Evan highlights in the book is around a routine.   \n\n* Routines take time and mental energy. \n\n* Come up with a system that can short circuit this process a little bit and allow you to spend less mental calories making decisions. \n\n* A very marquee example is Steve Jobs and wearing black turtlenecks.  Jobs decided to spend his mental energy on creativity instead of what he would wear the next day. \n\n* This reminds Nick of a story about the cycling team in [Chasing Excellence](https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Excellence-Building-Fittest-Athletes/dp/1619617285) that utilized small improvements (or the aggregation of marginal gains) to destroy the competition. \n\n* Maybe Steve Jobs wasn't so crazy.  :) \n\n* Evan and his family use a meal calendar.  There is no need to ask what is for dinner when dinner time comes around because it has been pre-planned (including getting proper groceries).  It's all part of a routine. \n\n* Nick mentions having a special bedtime routine that he and his daughter do daily.   \n\n## 13:18 - How to Document Your Work \n\n* Evan's book tells us not only what to do (document our work) but provides guidance on how to do it. \n\n* Evan created a worksheet (download a free copy of the format [here](https://ghostrules.com/worksheets/)) to break down collecting a portfolio of work into something easy to follow and manage. \n\n* The end result of the career accomplishments document is something you can cut and paste into a promotion package, onto a resume, etc. \n\n* In order to get to this point, there is a lot of work to be done on your part. \n\n* Within the document you need to answer… \n\n* What are your strengths? \n\n* What areas are your kryptonite and will drain your energy? \n\n* What are the problems you're solving? \n\n* What are some of the stats you want to accomplish? \n\n* Working through the questions is a helpful way to add structure to collecting all the activities you are doing and distill it down into what is in the document. \n\n* Invariably, if in a role long enough you will come up for a promotion or something like that.  Maybe you are switching roles and need to ready your resume. \n\n* Relying on your memory to keep track of all you have done is NOT effective and will provide you with a so-so proof of work.  \n\n* Documenting accomplishments regularly, how you achieved them, and how well you achieved them will improve the quality of output tremendously. \n\n* Evan updates his career accomplishment document regularly (monthly in his case on the first Wednesday of the month), and it is never complete.  It is a practice that keeps you from only relying on your memory. \n\n* Some projects may be years old, and your memory is not that good. \n\n* Evan picked up some tips on how to create this document from the [Manager Tools Podcast](https://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-podcasts). \n\n* Evan has been engaging in this practice for about a decade. \n\n* It's fun to go back and look at what he has accomplished, and in some portions he has highlighted goals. \n\n* Filling out the worksheet is like a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Once you put the things down in words your brain starts to think about ways to make it happen. \n\n* It's fun to go look at something that is 7-8 years old and say to yourself, \"that was a really cool accomplishment.\" \n\n* Nick believes this is a way to find your gratitude for what you get to do and what you have accomplished (looking at your progress). \n\n* Evan says the sense of accomplishment helps energize you. \n\n* What about putting our weaknesses in this document?  Why do that? \n\n* Even the best athlete has areas of specific focus. \n\n* Part of the exercise is self-inspection of areas where you are strong and others where you are not so strong. \n\n* Consider Marcus Buckingham's lessons about leveraging strengths from [First, Break All the Rules](https://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently/dp/1595621113). \n\n* Knowing the weaknesses allow you to have a discussion with your manager about things that are your kryptonite and draw away your energy. \n\n* There may be another person on the team who loves that part of the job (making it a win, win situation). \n\n* If not comfortable taking the conversation to your manager, find that person on the team directly.   \n\n* This is part of the reason we build relationships.  You may find there is something a person on the team is incredibly good at, allowing you to pair with that person  to accomplish a task and learn from them. \n\n* We should still be working on our development areas though they are not necessarily going to be what we capitalize on for promotion purposes.  But neglect of these areas / not being able to show progress made in filling gaps could keep you from getting promoted. \n\n* Progress in a weakness area may not be the best candidate for the daily report we discussed in [Episode 172](https://nerd-journey.com/ease-the-mind-through-daily-reporting-with-evan-oldford-1-2/) and might be better served to put in a journal you keep. \n\n## 19:09 - Delegation and Elimination \n\n* Knowledge of weakness areas may lend itself to ease of delegation. \n\n* When a manager delegates, he / she is still accountable for the result and is up to the manager to ensure something will be accomplished on time to the proper standard (can require some follow up). \n\n* Some tasks you may want to delegate to the floor because there is no value.  A report or a task you're doing may not be something looked at by anyone.   \n\n* In those times, you may want to stop doing something to see if someone responds. \n\n* How can we be ok with stopping things we have done for a long time? \n\n* It is tough letting go. \n\n* In these times, Evan encourages us to take a step back and assess.  Something can be a priority but fall below the line of priorities. \n\n* If it is 13 on the top 10 list of priorities, perhaps you need to put it to the side. \n\n* What about that feeling of taking something off the worksheet meaning you're doing less or looking bad? \n\n* This goes back to bandwidth management. \n\n* Some people just continue to do the thing and feel like they should be rewarded for continuing the thing.  But in reality it might not be valued any longer. \n\n* People who stop doing things after a while are doing less, but they are not delivering additional value by doing it anyway.  They have freed up a chunk of time for other things. \n\n* This goes back to value delivered to the organization, the greater community, your family, etc. \n\n## 22:33 - Genesis of Ghost Rules \n\n* Evan did not originally set out to create a book.  He initially was building some content for a team offsite with his direct reports. \n\n* A frequently asked question from employees was \"what do I need to do to get promoted?\" \n\n* Evan's thoughts on this formed the first draft of the first chapter of his book.  The first document created was something he shared with his wife, who encouraged him to run it by his HR partner. \n\n* Evan had a great relationship with his HR partner and showed her the draft too.  She said it was very good but that he could not give it to his team. \n\n* It was a bit too prescriptive and formulaic in that someone could look at the document, do the things suggested, and expect to receive a promotion by default.  That was not the intent. * Evan took this and shelved the document in favor of planning the offsite. \n\n* He started having 1-1s that involved a lot of friction and as a result put his thoughts into a different document. \n\n* Over a couple of years he looked at the wealth of information created and wanted to give back. \n\n* Evan worked chapter by chapter, and the topics lent themselves to compartmentalization really well (succinct chapters).  He proceeded down the rabbit hole of becoming an author. \n\n* The publishing part was made pretty easy through modern tools and democratization of publishing. \n\n* Evan worked on the book off and on for a period of about 2 years. \n\n* He had pulled together the content already on the side (which took a while to compile) here and there on weekends, writing down ideas as they came to him. \n\n* His editor was brutally honest, which Evan appreciated.  Some chapters needed rewriting while others were eviscerated. \n\n* The editor helped hone the tone and the content. \n\n* It was a fun yet challenging process that took probably a year of editing to reach the finished product. \n\n* If you haven't read the book, be sure to [get a copy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Rules-Unspoken-secrets-getting/dp/B09JBMWNN2). \n\n* The first chapter in the book, Getting Ahead, was what kick started and inspired the rest of the book. \n\n* The chapter that Evan feels flowed the best is titled Ceilings. \n\n* In your career there are many different ceilings.  Some of them relate to where you are and the structure of the business.  \n\n* This specific chapter was really fun to write, and Evan was extremely happy to share it with readers.  \n\n* If you have feedback for Evan, would like to chat further about the book, or get a different perspective on any topic you can find him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eoldford/). \n\n* Evan feels he will continue to write but does not at present have another book idea. \n\n* He finds the process of writing a way to really clarify a thought and improve your written communication skills (an area where we could all use some work). \n\n* At present Evan is working on another chapter for the book called Reading the Room (not yet ready), and he would like to add it at some point. \n\n## 28:56 - Parting Thoughts and What's Next \n\n* Higher level managers are looking at how to give back and clear obstacles for the organization and are focused on how to invest more in growth and upward mobility of the organization as a whole.   \n\n* Evan is loving what he is doing right now and not looking to change it up. \n\n* In the current market there are some very generous compensation packages being thrown around.  People often wonder what they should be doing next and what they should be looking for as their next gig. \n\n* Evan's advice is find a manager that is looking to invest in you.  The technology is not as interesting.  It could be a cool company with cool technology, but if your boss is a jerk, there is no longevity there.  You will not be happy there. \n\n* Find an awesome team that has your back and a great manager who will invest in you and give you the keys to driving your career. \n\n* \"Don't look at chasing that next big salary bump.  Find that great manager.\" -

In today's episode we share part 1 of an interview with Dominique Top, detailing her journey from music student to band leader, a stint in consumer electronics, and a move into recruitment in a DevOps vertical.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-13-2022 \n\nTopics – Meet [[Dominique Top]], The Music, Singing vs. Presenting, A Different Type of Work Experience, Sales Perception and Recruitment, Advice for Working with Recruiters \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:23 - Meet Dominique Top \n\n* [Dominique Top](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominiquetop/) is a Solutions Engineer at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) living in London. #HashiCorp #London\n\n* You can also follow her on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/devopsdomi). \n\n* Nick wanted to dig deeper into the career story Dominique shared at [DevOpsLoop 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq5J5g8emkY).  #DevOpsLoop\n\n## 2:48 - A Love for Music \n\n* Dominique has been fascinated with music since she was very young.   \n\n* She joined a secondary school around the age of 12 or 13, and there were loads of musicians there. \n\n* At some point she wanted a band.  She wanted to play music and sing songs. \n\n* She was eventually pretty busy with a band, having about 50 shows per year.  Dominique was with the band about 7-8 years. \n\n* Dominique felt this was what she wanted to do with her life and joined the Dutch Pop Academy in The Netherlands,  a very hands on university study where one learns how to be a better musician. \n\n* Dominique did sound engineering and vocals as well.  It taught her a great deal about the music industry. \n\n* Dominique was one of the lead singers of a band called Two Way Radio (7 person band).  They even have some videos out there on YouTube. \n\n* After being in the band she started doing work as a disc jockey (dj), which she still does today. \n\n* She was also the sole lead singer in a different band after Two Way Radio and has been involved in music in some form or another ever since. \n\n* Dominique has a side project called Duality Sync with a friend from the Netherlands that keeps her involved with music.  \n\n## 4:58 - Singing vs. Presenting \n\n* Does being a singer in a band help get you past stage fright one might experience giving a presentation? \n\n* There is a certain overlap. Being a lead singer requires a certain mindset and personality type. \n\n* Dominique likes being the center of attention.  Being on stage kind of does that to you. \n\n* When doing meetups, Dominique liked introducing the next speaker.  She tried to be more awkward than someone who might be giving a talk or a presentation. If she was excited and over the top, it might make it easier for a speaker that was nervous to calm down and bring their best self to a talk. \n\n* Nick feels like this helps create a safe space for people. \n\n* A singer can't stick to only singing when on stage for an audience.  They will likely need to say a few things to interact with the audience. Dominique says she was not always very good at this. \n\n* Dominique remembers when she was 16 / 17 and the band had a few gigs across the country.  She told a joke that didn't quite land with the audience.  Her band members told her they were not sure the audience understood the words she was saying.  They encouraged her to speak clearer to ensure the joke / message lands. \n\n* When you're on stage having just sang a song you are full of adrenaline and excited.   \n\n* When Dominique gets excited she tends to talk very fast, and at the time she did not have the tools to rein herself in a little and slow down.  Slowing down comes a bit more naturally for her these days after some deliberate practice. \n\n## 8:07 - A Different Type of Work Experience \n\n* Dominique eventually went into consumer electronics.  She mentioned it was more a stroke of luck than anything. \n\n* After graduation from the Pop Academy, Dominique needed a job. \n\n* As a musician, there is a big gap between getting money for your music and being successful when you first start. \n\n* Dominique was walking around her hometown thinking she needed a job, and the only shop she cared about was the iCentre (an Apple Premium Reseller). \n\n* Dominique had friends who worked at the shop and thought it seemed like the most interesting thing she could find in her area (without a great deal of travel).  She asked if they had any openings. \n\n* Dominique and her father were very into gadgets, having a computer in their home early on.  Dominique was one of the first people in her class to have a mobile phone as well. \n\n* The Apple ecosystem at the time was very impressive to Dominique.  This was in the early 2000s. \n\n* Dominique got the job, citing it as very fun.  She was able to learn about the different devices and processes. \n\n* She enjoyed having conversations with people and asking what problem people expected a certain product to solve for them (a bit of a thread during her career). \n\n* Dominique liked the Apple way of understanding the people and why they want to buy certain things.  Simon Sinek's [Start with Why](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591846447) is a good reference. \n\n* Dominique is the type of person that wants to know everything about everything to do a good job. \n\n* The store where she worked had a service desk staffed with certified technicians. \n\n* When technicians would swap out RAM, hard drives, change SIM cards, etc. Dominique was very curious and started asking a bunch of questions.  Constant curiosity is something that has served Dominique well. \n\n* A service technician friend to Dominique at some point asked if she wanted to give it a try (a repair to a demo device) with the technician looking over her shoulder.   \n\n* The experience was fun and got Dominique more excited about the inner workings of computers and how everything else worked. \n\n* Dominique believes the social interaction with customers was likely easier because of her background compared to someone else who may have been fresh out of school. \n\n* The branch where Dominique worked was one of the larger ones in the country (and had a very large team).  People would come from all around the area to this specific store. \n\n* There were certain regulars that would come into the store. \n\n* Through asking about why people were needing a specific device, who would use it, what people's hobbies where Dominique was about to learn a great deal about them. \n\n* Some of the people who came into the store back then remain friends with Dominique to this day and talk to her regularly.  \n\n* It also helps if you don't have an embarrassment or discomfort talking about yourself or with other people.  Dominique really likes talking with people. \n\n# 13:14 - Sales Perception and Recruitment \n\n* Dominique never struggled with the perception of salespeople while at iCentre. \n\n* She felt she was really helping people, feeling she was advising them to make purchases. \n\n* Dominique likes the pragmatic approach and helps people make educated decisions.  \n\n* She understands salespeople get a bad reputation and felt more that way when she later went into recruitment. \n\n* After about 4.5 years  with iCenter, Dominique felt she wanted something else.  Devices get refreshed, but at some point you're having the same conversations. \n\n* After this much time doing something, it felt like she was ready for a next step. \n\n* Dominique went and worked for a recruitment company (which she touched on in her DevOps Loop talk linked above). \n\n* A friend of Dominique's suggested she create a LinkedIn profile and see what happens. \n\n* Dominique felt something more \"grown up\" was needed, perhaps something in an office.   \n\n* She wanted something which would enable making connections with people.  Maybe that was sales, something like account management, for example, which could suit her skills. \n\n* After a couple of days the messages started rolling in, and a recruiter (from the company where she eventually worked) said he might have something for her in IT recruitment. \n\n* The first thing Dominique wanted to know was more about IT recruitment.  The explanation went something like this: \n\n* You have a customer and some candidates for an open position (with specific requirements).  Each side wants something, and you basically match them. \n\n* To Dominique that meant she could talk about technology all day and help people, and she said \"let's do it.\" \n\n* When she started they put her in a DevOps vertical.  She first wanted to know what that meant. \n\n* She was told they had heard it was lucrative and that she needed to ask her candidates. \n\n* Perhaps it should have been a red flag at the time.  It's always easy to talk about things in hindsight. \n\n* In learning more about it, DevOps seemed interesting to Dominique.  \n\n* As Dominique spent more time in recruitment she realized people don't like recruiters at all.  In fact some people hate recruiters or hate working with them.  That was difficult for her to reconcile. \n\n* Later when she started going to more meetups (or user groups) related to DevOps and adjacent topics, telling people she worked for a recruitment firm might cause the person to walk away. \n\n* That was a really weird experience, a bit humbling and awkward. \n\n* Dominique told people she was there to learn about the technologies to setup the possibility of moving into that field deeper one day.   \n\n* The treatment she was experiencing did not seem fair, so at one point she stopped talking about her job entirely until she worked at a role that was more focused on the community. \n\n* General recruitment practices might be to close the candidate at the lowest salary possible and then protect the most margin for the firm getting the candidate for an end customer.   \n\n* Dominique does not like these practices, feeling she identified more with the technical people she spoke to daily than the recruiters who were her co-workers.  That has been a huge catalyst in getting her to where she is today. \n\n* As a recruiter, how can you determine if a candidate is qualified for a role you have never done? \n\n* This is something not every recruiter has figured out yet.  For Dominique it comes back to wanting to know everything about everything. \n\n* In the first several months of her time in the role speaking to engineers, Dominique wanted to know: \n\n*  What is DevOps?  There were loads of interesting explanations. \n\n* What are the technologies you are using, why do those technologies work together / why would they not work together, what does the software development lifecycle look like, and why is it important to you and your company? \n\n* What do you want to do in your job and in your career?  What is your ambition? \n\n* Dominique asked the questions and was able to figure out  \n\n* Who the person really is \n\n* What they are good at \n\n* What they are NOT good at (if they will share) \n\n* On the other side, she would ask the companies that needed candidates why they needed the position, why they wanted a specific person, why the technologies were important to them, etc. \n\n* Not everyone was willing to share, but looking back at it, Dominique feels she did get a lot of helpful information and that not every recruiter asks these questions. \n\n* Dominique feels that over the course of her life she has been able to make friends easily and that most have been pretty forthcoming with her. \n\n* People might ask her why she needed certain information.  Dominique would make it very clear that though she might not have something for the person right now she could at least keep their goals and ambition in mind as she heard about more roles to be filled (i.e. might have something later). \n\n* In the recruiting world there are two main types of recruitment. \n\n* Permanent recruitment is looking for people to fill permanent positions. \n\n* This can involve a headhunting fee. \n\n* Contract recruitment would be filling temporary positions (i.e. 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 month roles perhaps).  Once someone finished the role (often times to help with a project), they would be looking for something else (part of the reason Dominique made sure to keep in touch). \n\n* In these cases there is usually a contractor's day rate + margin that has to be paid to the recruitment company on a monthly basis. \n\n* The contractor would bill the recruitment company, and the recruitment company would bill the end customer. \n\n## 23:05 - Advice for Working with Recruiters \n\n* Dominique will only give time to recruiters she feels are good at what they do. \n\n* She works to treat others as she would want to be treated. \n\n* An auto-generated e-mail to her might not receive a response.  Generally she will respond to those who took the time to read her LinkedIn profile. \n\n* She is a little more guarded with the information given to recruiters after spending some time working as one. \n\n* There are a number of bad seeds in the industry who are only motivated by money.  \n\n* \"A good recruiter is worth their weight in gold.  That's it.\" - Dominique Top \n\n* Look for a good person who can represent your needs and interests, understand what the industry does, and really understands the role they are representing. \n\n* Estate agents are (or can be) worse that recruiters. \n\n* Maybe we should filter the recruiters who contact us and feel them out a little. \n\n* Dominique is happy she is no longer in recruitment, but as a word of advice… \n\n* If you are contacted, did the recruiter take the time to read your profile? \n\n* Dominique gets contacted most every day by recruiters and does not respond to most of them.  She recommends feeling out whether the person is good enough. \n\n* If something looks interesting, ask the person to send you a salary range.  Look for those willing to talk about it.  Everyone has a budget. \n\n* Is the job even related to what you do today?  Dominique cites getting contacted about things she has not been in for a number of years. \n\n* Check out [Episode

In today's episode we share part 2 of an interview with Dominique Top, detailing her transition into a community advocate, experience as a meetup group leader, the road to HashiCorp, and how she has been making an impact since joining.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-13-2022 \n\n[Dominique Top](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominiquetop/) is a Solutions Engineer at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) living in London.  Catch part 1 of our interview with Dominique in [Episode 174](https://nerd-journey.com/perform-the-discovery-with-dominique-top-1-2/).  [[Dominique Top]] #HashiCorp [[Episode 174]]\n\nTopics – #DevOps Community Advocate and #DeveloperRelations, The Meetup Group Leader, HashiCorp and Startup Life, Making an Impact, Parting Thoughts \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:37 - DevOps Community Advocate and Developer Relations \n\n* Fast forward to when Dominique was working at Tecknuovo as a recruiter.  She started working here about 6 months after moving to the UK. \n\n* When she moved to the UK, Dominique would go all over to Kubernetes meetups, DevOps Exchange meetups, London DevOps, Docker meetups…everything she could related to our adjacent to DevOps. \n\n* Her manager at Tecknuovo saw what she was doing as useful.  The manager recognized it was important to Dominique, and she was always advocating for community.   \n\n* The manager thought they could come up with something which was a bit more community focused.   \n\n* Dominique knew the communities were for the engineers  and the importance of proper behavior when attending the meetups (behave as guests). \n\n* Many recruiters would go to meetups to poach talent. \n\n* Some people would go to meetups, eat the pizza, drink the beer, and talk about accomplishments they have achieved. \n\n* It was interesting for Dominique to be a developer / DevOps Advocate between a company and the community.   \n\n* Rather than go and only be a sponge, she would go and be the face of the company. \n\n* Tecknuovo would sponsor a lot of these types of meetups (which were extremely fun for Dominique). \n\n* The community was one of the reasons Dominique felt just recruitment was not what she wanted any longer. \n\n* Being on the phone all day calling people was not something Dominique really enjoyed. \n\n* At some point she felt a great deal more comfortable sharing what her job was.   \"Yes I'm a recruiter, but I am not here to recruit you.\" \n\n* But as a result of attending so many meetups and knowing what Dominique did, people would tell her when they were looking.  She could then make the connection between that person and some of her colleagues. \n\n* It was an interesting reciprocal relationship between the community, Dominique, and the company where she worked. \n\n* It took a lot of time going to every single meetup but may have also been a catalyst in wanting to do more in the realm of developer relations (in which she did a short stint after her time at Tecknuovo). \n\n* Developer Relations vs. DevOps Community Advocate \n\n* Dominique gives some examples of Liz Rice and [Matt Stratton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattstratton/), some of whom Nick recognized as [DevLops Loop](https://devopsloop.io/2021/agenda) participants in 2021. \n\n* These folks (and those like them) represent their company as a Developer Relations person. \n\n* For software companies, having someone act as a bridge between the company and the community is very beneficial. \n\n* Taking the example of [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/), the developer advocates field questions from the community, participate in online forums, create interesting content sharing what can be done with HashiCorp's open source technologies, for example.  \n\n* [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) as well as [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), [AquaSec](https://www.aquasec.com/), and [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) also have folks who perform this role, for example.   \n\n* Many of the people Dominique mentioned help organize [DevOpsDays](https://devopsdays.org/) events.  \n\n* These roles may or may not fall under the Technical Marketing umbrella. \n\n* Dominique attended [DevRelCon](https://developerrelations.com/devrelcon) a couple of years ago.   \n\n* Developer relations is a bit of a new segment in the industry.  Some companies may have this role inside technical product marketing while others may have it in engineering. \n\n* It depends on what the company expects these people to do. \n\n* Sometimes it will be important for someone in this role to help hand off qualified leads (i.e. someone who started with open source and is looking for more enterprise solutions). \n\n* In other cases it may be about getting feedback from customers using existing products and helping to make them better. \n\n* Basically this is like a modern day [bard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard) - giving talks to present interesting content (with demos) and making sure people want to engage. \n\n* The difference between what Dominique did at Tecknuovo and what she aspired to do at Babylon Health was being even moreso embedded in the technical communities, helping the community solve problems with solutions the company she worked for had to offer. \n\n* The difference between advocacy and developer relations is that developer relations takes things a bit further. \n\n## 9:42 - The Meetup Group Leader \n\n* About 6 months into her Tecknuovo stint, the person leading the local Docker meetup group appeared to be a bit overburdened (was at the same time working on a startup). \n\n* Dominique asked how she could help.  Once she began to help her, the leader asked if she might like to just take over entirely.  She agreed. \n\n* Dominique likes organizing things and helping people.  It was fun to do this and become the group leader.  * There were a number of interesting talks which took place. \n\n* About 2 years after she took over the pandemic hit, which has not been great for in-person meetups. \n\n* Pre-pandemic attendance was 100-150 people at an in-person meeting. \n\n* Dominique was the main leader of the group after taking over (a volunteer position), but over time she delegated tasks to others.  \n\n* Her partner even helped out.  He works in a similar field to her, always solving problems. \n\n* Dominique's partner helped live stream a number of meetup events pre-pandemic and would make sure all the equipment was setup and ready to go.  Being a fixer, he was always willing to help. \n\n* Nick mentions his experience co-leading a community group and the responsibility to get sponsors, schedule, find a venue, get community speakers, and open up / close the meetings for the group (including sharing the meeting agenda, introducing speakers, and doing icebreakers). \n\n* Dominique says the meetup scene in London is huge.  There are so many who want to come and learn there wouldn't be time for everyone to share something to open a meeting.   \n\n* Dominique would normally have a couple of sponsors lined up for meetings.  Sponsors would get their company logo on the screen and have their company mentioned in the opening.  That did not necessarily mean the vendor gets a talking slot.  Usually the talk submission was a separate process (and anyone could submit something). \n\n* Dominique would prefer to give the community the priority, having 2-3 talks that filled an hour slot, break for food, have one more speaker after that, and then proceed to a pub for networking and further discussion. \n\n* The networking sessions were often the best part because they were a chance to get feedback on what worked and what did not.  Sometimes the vendor sponsors would also sponsor the networking session. \n\n* Dominique has kept these so they are sales free discussions, focusing on something that can be done with an open source tool.  She says folks in the community are often times not very open to something they will need to pay for unless this kind of topic is specifically requested. \n\n* When leading a meetup / user group, the importance of knowing your user base is paramount! \n\n* Like many others when around so many brilliant people, Dominique suffers from impostor syndrome, feeling it might be better to give others time on the stage. \n\n* She has presented at a number of conferences but due to the pandemic was not able to give a talk in this specific meetup group. \n\n* There's so much content available for those who might want to learn more about DevOps, making it somewhat overwhelming and hard to know where to start. \n\n* Platforms like [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com/) or [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) are helpful.   \n\n* Don't forget about attending meetups to help here too. \n\n* Talk to other people about how they got into this industry.   Not everyone took the traditional / classically trained path. \n\n* Start a small project to see if you can get something working.  Don't be afraid to fail. \n\n* Dominique still has to remind herself that it's ok to not be perfect. \n\n* And stay curious! \n\n## 17:27 - HashiCorp and Startup Life \n\n* Dominique has been at HashiCorp for about 2 years at the time of this recording. \n\n* In her time attending meetups she had meet a  solution engineering geography leader for Europe from HashiCorp (Nico) who was a friend of a meetup leader Dominique knew. \n\n* The introduction was made years before Dominique started thinking about HashiCorp. \n\n* Dominique was asked if she might want to work for HashiCorp. She said yes.  This was back when she was a recruiter. \n\n* She was then asked why she might want to work for HashiCorp. \n\n* Dominique liked talking to technical people (lots of DevOps engineers, for example). \n\n* She had also been told by an engineer she met at a meetup group to remember the name [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) (which she did). \n\n* Throughout her recruitment career she has heard of Terraform and Vault on many occasions. \n\n* Dominique told Nico she wanted out of recruitment.  When he asked if solutions engineering might be of interest, she said yes but felt she did not have the proper technical skills. \n\n* It was suggested that Dominique get a certification (which she did with AWS), gain skills with Linux  (which she did through installing Linux and tinkering with it), and do some simple development (which Dominique has done through a small website she built). \n\n * Dominique likely knows more than she gives herself credit for knowing. \n\n* About a year later, she ran into Nico again.  When he asked if she still wanted to come work for him (mentioning that he had open head count), she said yes. \n\n* It was a series of about 6 interviews in a week, including a technical exercise.  Dominique got the job as a solutions engineer at HashiCorp. \n\n* HashiCorp was the first startup Dominique joined in the technology space. \n\n* Tecknuovo, for example, considered itself a startup (but not in exactly the same space).  She was part of a 20-person company at that time. \n\n* When she joined HashiCorp they had over 900 employees.  It definitely had the startup vibe.  If you had an idea, you could make a pitch to someone and if approved give it a try. \n\n* Your day job consisted of certain things, but if you wanted to help in other areas you could. \n\n* It's interesting and inspiring to see how everyone was working toward a single goal (get to IPO).  Dominique had never experienced something like this before joining. \n\n* They seem to have new people joining every day and at this point are over 2000 employees as of the time of this recording. \n\n* Picking a startup completely depends on what you might be looking for, but you can expect… \n\n* There is nothing as constant as change.  You can blink your eyes twice, and there is a new process. \n\n* It's fairly fast paced, so it is important to protect a healthy work life balance. \n\n* Is the mission statement something you care about?   \n\n* Are the principles of the company aligned with your own values? \n\n* Are the written principles something the company actually believes? \n\n* Dominique believes HashiCorp does believe and that things done are viewed through these principles. \n\n* One of the principles at HashiCorp is kindness (full list with details can be found [here](https://www.hashicorp.com/our-principles)). \n\n* Do people seem happy or stressed? \n\n* Do you believe in the product and the company go to market strategy? \n\n* \"Every company has a product that will work.  But you need to find something that you believe in.\" - Dominique Top \n\n## 23:59 - Making an Impact \n\n* Dominique co-founded the Neurodiversity Employee Resource Group (or ERG) called NeuroD+ inside HashiCorp that serves neurodivergent employees. \n\n* Dominique has ADHD. \n\n* The group was started because there are a lot of neurodivergent employees who may not feel like they have the same voice as those who are more \"neurotypical.\" \n\n* It is important to ensure company policies and processes take all employees into account.  There is a lot of work inside HashiCorp being done to focus on [[Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion|DEI]] (diversity, equity, and inclusion).  \n\n* For example, are we thinking of reasonable accommodations in the interview process, in company outings, etc. \n\n* One thing Dominique has been fighting for (and has not resolved inside the company) is to have live closed captions.  This is for those who are not native English speakers.  It is also helpful for neurodivergent folks to see things in addition to just hearing it (makes it easier to parse). \n\n* Dominique has also co-founded a WISE Special Interest Group (or SIG).  \n\n* In the wider solutions engineering community, this stands for Women in Solution Engineering.  The one Dominique is a part of inside HashiCorp also includes non-binary and other marginalized genders. \n\n* Women in technology are not as prevalent.  Members of the WISE community will have some experiences and things they struggle with that may not be the case for their male counterparts and have thus created a safe space for discussion together. \n\n* The group has a regular cadence with solutions engineering leadership to give a readout on what's happening within the collective group.  The fact that the WISE group has a seat at the table with leaders and that leaders are listening is really cool. \n\n* How can men in technology support these kind of efforts? \n\n* The most important thing is understanding what it means to be an ally.  You constantly work on this.   \n\n* Ask questions.  Ask your local non-male solutions engineer or anyone if there's anything you can do to support them. \n\n* If you do get a chance to be in a meeting with someone who is in the minority, make sure you give them a chance to contribute in a safe space. \n\n* It might be a very small thing, but it could be super impactful to the person. \n\n* More details on each of these organizations can be found on [Dominique's LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominiquetop/) in the Organizations area. \n\n## 29:00 - Parting Thoughts \n\n* If she did it all over again, Dominique feels she would follow the same path. \n\n* Dominique does not like having regrets about things.  She makes decisions based on the information she has at a certain time.  If at some point she realizes that could have been made better she will learn from it and carry the learnings into the future. \n\n* All of her experiences in life have been a culmination of learning.  \n\n* If you want to accelerate into something really fast, you must be willing to give up everything else. \n\n* To make things sustainable, carve out blocks of time to do a project. \n\n* Trust your process, and make sure you do not get ahead of yourself. \n\n* Now more than ever, we need to consider mental health and ways to protect and preserve it. \n\n* If you hyperfocus on one thing and then burnout because you. \n\n* Whatever you do, take it on in a balanced way.  \n\n* Episodes mentioned in the outro \n\n* [Episode 33](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-033-tony-reeves-part-2-user-and-advocacy-groups/) with Tony Reeves about user groups and leadership \n\n* [Episode 167](https://nerd-journey.com/pause-and-step-outside-with-andrew-miller-3-3/) and Andrew Miller's mention of the right place and right time \n\n* [Episode 129](https://nerd-journey.com/the-challenges-of-a-superpower-with-jon-towles-1-2/) and [Episode 130](https://nerd-journey.com/the-excellent-advocate-with-jon-towles-2-2/) with Jon Towles \n\n* [Episode 117](https://nerd-journey.com/bold-moves-and-blind-spots-with-kate-emshoff-1-2/) [Episode 118](https://nerd-journey.com/the-career-minded-curious-mother-with-kate-emshoff-2-2/) with Kate Emshoff \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-176":{"title":"Episode 176","content":"\n# Episode 176\n\nWelcome to episode 176 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss John's experience becoming a parent, planning for and taking parental leave, lessons learned along the way, and the impact on his career. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-12-2022 \n\nTopics – Context for the Show, Starting a #Family, Planning for #parental_leave , Communication and Preparing the Team, Return to Work, Lessons Learned and Parting Thoughts \n\n=========================== \n\n## 1:17 - Context for the Show \n\n* John and his wife welcomed daughter Keiko Vay White on March 29, 2022.  It's been a little overwhelming but overall a terrific thing. \n\n* John took some parental leave and this week will share the process of preparing for it, taking it, and returning from it. \n\n## 2:40 - Starting a Family \n\n* It's overwhelming and amazing to hold a baby in your arms and realize you are responsible for it for conceivable the rest of your life. \n\n* It's been an exhausting, very gratifying, amazing experience that John would highly recommend (depending on your situation). \n\n* John realized back when he and his wife were discussing getting married his tolerance for financial risk was pretty low, feeling the need to be in a specific financial position before having a child. \n\n* This was more about risk mitigation than any specific amount of money being in the bank first. \n\n* John was able to work through these concerns after some help from a family therapist. \n\n* Some of this was based on the way John was raised and not having immediate family around for help with child care.  \n\n* Some risk was a result of having a child during a pandemic.    Even getting help with childcare from friends can introduce risk and expectations of certain behaviors that align to your level of comfort. \n\n* Nick mentions the implications of knowing a small human is 100% dependent on you and your spouse / partner for everything can be very humbling. \n\n* It helped John to understand what was scary about the scenario, considering a worst case and what he would be able to control if that happened. \n\n* After working through some worst case scenarios John understood that his fears were more about the unknown factors.  He came to understand that there were unknown factors for other life decisions he had already made (like his job change to Google) which seemed to work out well.  Think of it as analogous fear. \n\n## 7:47 - Planning for [[Parental Leave]] \n\n* Many people have a fear of parental leave.  What were some of the considerations for John and his wife? \n\n* Check out [Episode 111](https://nerd-journey.com/a-career-in-technical-sales-with-caitlyn-bryan-part-1-2/) and [Episode 112](https://nerd-journey.com/pregnancy-during-a-technical-career-with-caitlyn-bryan-2-2/) with [[Caitlyn Bryan]] for the story of her forced parental leave. [[Episode 111]] [[Episode 112]]\n\n* John and his wife used in vitro fertilization to get pregnant.   \n\n* John's employer has a generous in vitro fertilization benefit, so they explored it and went through the research process.  They eventually had a better idea of when the birth would be as the process continued. \n\n* Planning for parental leave starts when you are looking for a job.  It can be an awkward thing to ask about. \n\n* Do some investigation on this, and be courageous enough to ask questions.  Some companies are very proud to publish their policies on parental leave, while others may not be as forthcoming. \n\n* Being able to take the time off and in multiple chunks if needed ends up being very important (and has been important to John from his experience). \n\n* This may not be something on our horizon when we are younger (i.e. considering we might want to have a child in the next 5 years for example), but once it is, put in the time to research. \n\n* Depending on benefits offered by your company and overall satisfaction, a benefit like this could be a reason to change jobs. \n\n* Paid parental leave can be something factored into a total compensation package when looking at a new employer. \n\n* Nick mentioned depending on your stage of life, other benefits may need to be considered (i.e. elderly care for aging parents, etc.).  It's another point of consideration. \n\n* The option to go full in vitro was a massive benefit to John and his wife.  If it is something you need, keep that in mind (process is very expensive, potentially something like $50,000). \n\n* Finding out if there is a similar leave / support / financial support for adoption is something to investigate.  John's wife asked about this, for example. \n\n* Adoption can also be an expensive endeavor.    \n\n* Research things like time for family bonding in cases of adopting a child. \n\n* Nick asked about foster care / foster families and any benefits available for these cases. \n\n* Usually foster parents / families are compensated by the foster system and may not be as much of a consideration.   \n\n* People act as foster families sometimes as a personal calling.   \n\n* It would be great to have someone on the show to share their experience as a foster parent and the impact on career. \n\n* Having a child during a pandemic was pretty disruptive.   \n\n* There are so many complications around hospital visits and needing to test before you go in, navigating whether a spouse or partner can be there too, etc. \n\n* There is a shortage of obstetricians at hospitals.  Even if you pick a hospital it does not mean they will be able to support you due to staff levels and in some cases nurse strikes. \n\n* We probably need to address taking better care of medical professionals as a society (compensation, job security, etc.). \n\n* John and his wife used a birthing center staffed by midwives.  Shout out to the [Pacifica Family Maternity Center](https://pacificamaternity.com/) in the East Bay area. \n\n* Definitely investigate maternity centers and midwives. \n\n* There were strict rules like no admittance outside of between 36 and 40 weeks pregnant (outside of that goes directly to a hospital with midwife support). \n\n* If the baby is in breach position, the mother may need pain medication, or a C-section was needed the facility would not be able to support you (hospital only). \n\n* John and his wife picked a facility very close to a hospital. \n\n## 19:16 - Communication and Preparing the Team \n\n* Knowing the approximate date of birth really helps.  You have to start communicating with your management chain about what you need for support. \n\n* John's management chain was extremely supportive and very happy for him.   \n\n* Management modeled behaviors through managers having children, helping John understand the coverage during his absence, and explaining how the process worked inside John's company. \n\n* It's a great feeling to be supported like this. \n\n* You need to understand what the process and procedures are for beginning the leave.   \n\n* Usually it's pretty fault tolerant (i.e. maybe you were already off on PTO but need to swap to parental leave unexpectedly). \n\n* Prepping a team for your absence has a lot to do with things we have discussed in the past such as… \n\n* Maintaining State - updated documents in a shared place containing active work with next steps, setup ahead of time, and communicated  \n\n* John walked people through these documents in advance and made sure they were up to date with his circumstances \n\n* If no one knows what you were doing, that means things are falling through the cracks when you leave and can split your attention. \n\n* Even if things are 90% updated with the last 10% relayed verbally, that's about as good as you can hope for. \n\n* Soft cut over vs. hard cut over \n\n* John had the benefit of having someone shadow him during the last few weeks before the birth so that person would gain more context than can be contained in a document.   \n\n* We normally write documentation for others and will provide additional verbal context \n\n* Availability while on leave \n\n* John communicated that he was available on a non-emergency basis while on leave but might need a couple of days to respond. \n\n* It's better to ask questions early and often before something becomes an emergency (i.e. no guarantee John could be reached if there was an emergency). \n\n* This approach worked pretty well for John and allowed him to answer questions and ensure all the right folks had access to documents. \n\n* The two way conversation is much easier to have when it's not an emergency. \n\n* Did John set boundaries on when to check for messages to avoid constantly checking while on leave, and did it align with deep work methodologies? \n\n* John felt free to completely walk away from work (i.e. achieved alignment here) \n\n* John did not schedule a specific time period in which to check for new messages (i.e. didn't quite align).  But John did make an effort to check in and scan for messages (e-mail and chats) needing attention when he could.  And more importantly, he let people know what types of messages he would be checking.   \n\n* Listen to how he used filtering techniques for e-mail to make that process easier.   \n\n* Have faith in the preparation process before walking away. \n\n* For John, the process of maintaining state and having documents available to people was very helpful.   \n\n* John updated the documents he was already maintaining more frequently to make walking away trivial. \n\n* Let go of ego (i.e. \"I need to be the one who is doing this thing / this process\") \n\n* John had to shift to taking pride in the process he's been following and trusting that a qualified individual could step in to help carry things forward / maintain what was started. \n\n* John did not want to make himself a point of failure in the process.  That's a bad thing no matter who you are and what you do. \n\n* \"If you set it up for it to be impossible to be done without you, you should NOT take pride in that.\" - John White \n\n* Nick suggests the transition to this point probably needs to be gradual. \n\n* John's role in technical pre-sales often involves bringing in specialists, so it is already not him who is doing everything. \n\n* John takes pride in facilitating the specialist interaction and helping to keep follow ups on track while holding others responsible for things they should own. \n\n* In a way John was already there.  He had to realize this was the case and incorporate that into the pride he took in the process, making it as easy as possible for someone else to orchestrate these processes in his absence. \n\n* Someone who carries the ball in your stead may not do things the exact same way as you but could still help make progress toward the goal.  It is always good to have more than one person looking at something. \n\n* A colleague may be better at the execution while you're better at the setup, which could contribute to deeper collaboration at a later time. \n\n* John has a lot of pride when someone asks him for an account transfer meeting.  He sits down with the person to make sure they have all the information needed to hit the ground running. \n\n* Nick cites this as an extension of the [golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule). \n\n* This goes back to personal brand and what John wants his brand to be.  When someone looks at the content John produced for an account he's covering and can get an 80% understanding of things, it speaks volumes to the quality of John's work and dedication to helping others. \n\n* The experience with account hand offs in the past helped prepare John to transition active work to others when he want on parental leave. \n\n## 35:25 - Return to Work \n\n* John's understanding of parental leave is that you aren't guaranteed to walk back into the same job necessarily.  You're guaranteed a job at the same seniority level with a similar title and responsibilities. \n\n* He theoretically could have been moved to different team covering a different set of accounts.   \n\n* This could have happened without going on leave, actually.  Sometimes that is part of the job. \n\n* Coming back, John knew he would need to ease back into things since he had been out of touch for a while. \n\n* The account rep who owned the accounts and the technical resource covering for John had multiple meetings per week to talk about planning and coordination.   \n\n* John let them know he would start joining some of these meetings even before being officially back.  John sat in on these calls with the rule that he would not take any action items but would give feedback. \n\n* Nick likes the boundary to set intent.  It's too easy to get sucked into more if you don't do something like this.  John gave himself the ability to say no to requests by doing this. \n\n* John had to accept the fact that his team may have changed composition or that he might not be the primary person covering the open tasks / projects for the same accounts moving forward.   \n\n* That should be fine. \n\n* What about motivation in coming back? \n\n* One part is have I done enough at home to help with my child and my family?  You have to gauge whether you have taken enough time off. \n\n* John had a generous amount of time to take off and was able to do it in multiple chunks.   \n\n* He had originally scheduled 8 weeks but ended up taking 10 total necessary because of the need to support his family). \n\n* Knowing that he and his wife were aligned on the amount of support needed and available was a great thing. \n\n* Once the family situation was more comfortable from a support perspective, there's the intellectual stimulation aspect to consider. \n\n* John very much enjoys what he does for work and doesn't consider it \"just a job\" but rather something incorporating a great deal of problem solving. \n\n* It was difficult to walk away, but when he did, John was focused on solving a whole new set of problems in becoming a new parent. \n\n* Even if John could have quit his job from a financial stability standpoint he might not have because the intellectual side of it is really interesting.  John enjoys working with customers, the types of customers, and collaboration with colleagues in ways that push him to keep growing. \n\n* It was not hard to get motivated to return because of how much John enjoys his work. \n\n* Nick would love to hear from anyone out there who has taken a leave like this (of any kind) and realized they were burned out at work. \n\n* John had a situation like that while working at VMware.   \n\n* John lost his father in 2019, and he believes this had a part in him leaving the company. \n\n* Taking some time off helped John realize he was at a bit of a breaking point. \n\n* Maybe John needed to take more time off for grieving but didn't in that situation. \n\n* Time away can make you examine what it is you are returning to.  That is one of the things that happens. \n\n* Do I want to go back?  If I don't, what is causing me to not want to go back? \n\n* The answers are rarely black and white.  \n\n* Maybe we can ask future guests about times of leave and analysis of job transitions. \n\n* Sometimes it's just a conversation with management about things that need to change (also a legitimate response). \n\n## 45:01 - Lessons Learned and Parting Thoughts \n\n* John is still thinking about how well his systems worked while he was away.   \n\n* If the documents didn’t get updated, why not?  Was the process too difficult?  Did it not fit the person's style? \n\n* If the person did keep things updated but John had trouble transitioning back in, what gaps existed in the system, and how can those be tested for? \n\n* The transition back was a really great way to test that process of maintaining state. \n\n* John feels like he will protect his schedule a bit more now that he is a parent. \n\n* He has been making breakfast for his wife while she feeds the baby in the mornings. \n\n* The time John comes online may be more structured.  Early meetings, at least for the time being, may not be possible due to family obligations.  With enough notice he may be able to work around things accordingly. \n\n* Lunch time will be a similar story. His wife will need a break from the baby. \n\n* John can put these times into his calendar to allow his colleagues insight and understanding of when he is not available. \n\n* People need to think about some of these things ahead of time.  \n\n* When something is on the horizon, don't leave all the research to do all at once. \n\n* Research early, and research often.  Let the importance / likelihood of an event happening drive how much research you do (i.e. if not serious may not need to do much research right now). \n\n* Know the policy and some helpful resources\n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-177":{"title":"Episode 177","content":"\n# Episode 177\n\nWelcome to episode 177 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 1 of an interview with Stephanie Wong, discussing her path into the tech industry, internship experiences, time at Oracle, experience in pre-sales and post-sales roles, saying no to a dream company, and diving into content creation. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-13-2022 \n\nTopics – Meet [[Stephanie Wong]], Getting into Tech, Entertainment Influence on the West Coast, Joining Oracle, A Customer Success Pivot, Traditional and Non-Traditional Paths, Saying No to a Dream Company, Back to Sales Engineering, Getting Past a Plateau #GoogleCloud #DeveloperEngagement #DeveloperRelations \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:53 - Meet Stephanie Wong \n\n* [Stephanie Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephrwong/) works for Google Cloud as the Head of Developer Engagement.   \n\n* She is primarily a content creator and an engineer as well as a first generation Asian American based in the San Francisco area. \n\n* Throughout her career at Google, she has grown to have an audience of enterprise developers, IT executives, data scientists, startup founders, and other technical practitioners. \n\n* Over the last 4 years, she has been able to write, produce, and host over 450 videos, articles, podcasts, and tutorials amounting to around 10 million views. \n\n* Stephanie enjoys tapping into the technical community with refreshing takes about product launches in a way that dismantles egos in tech and helps to educate engineers in new ways. \n\n* If you want to follow up with Stephanie, you can find her \n\n* On Twitter - [@stephr_wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) \n\n* On LinkedIn [stephrwong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephrwong/) \n\n* On TikTok [@stephr_wong](https://www.tiktok.com/@stephr_wong) \n\n* She also has a YouTube channel called [Steph You Should Know](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM32wWY68Q5IbpVxMUN-woA) \n\n* John recommends two cool things… \n\n* Check out the [Google Cloud Tech YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/googlecloudplatform) \n\n* See also the [Google Cloud Platform Podcast](https://www.gcppodcast.com/) \n\n* It's interesting to see how they do technical content starting with beginners and partition into product families. \n\n* Stephanie took over the podcast last year, and it's been like her own little Nerd Journey, getting used to hosting and having to immerse herself in all cloud topics and speaking to them at a certain depth and comfortably. \n\n* It's been a huge honor and a lot of fun for Stephanie, feeling it has helped her boost her own career path in all things cloud. \n\n* In their roles as sales engineers, Nick and John both have broad portfolios of products they can dig deeper into based on interest and customer questions.  It will be interesting to hear how Stephanie keeps up to date. \n\n## 5:57 - Getting into Tech \n\n* Stephanie has had a somewhat unconventional path into both engineering and content creation. \n\n* Unlike many of the engineers around her, Stephanie did not graduate with a computer science degree.   \n\n* Stephanie got a different kind of CS degree (communications studies) and minored in digital humanities. \n\n* She's always had a deep passion for entertainment and video production. \n\n* In school she tried to merge those by studying interpersonal and broad based communication and doing a minor that allowed her to dive deep into the impact of technology on society, literature, and other areas. \n\n* When she entered the job market she almost went into entertainment (hard to advance in).  But she landed in tech partially due to her college and the companies that were recruiting at the time. \n\n* Stephanie had some very interesting internship experiences related to her minor.  They introduced her to technology, which really gave her the edge needed to get hired into her first job at Oracle (not her intention specifically). \n\n* Stephanie chose the minor because she was not interested in completely committing to engineering or computer science, but she did want to get exposed to technology (had a passion for consumer technology). \n\n* When she found out digital humanities was being offered at UCLA she jumped at the opportunity.  It gave her a chance to study things like social media analytics, content information systems, and really understand the broad concepts of technology and how they touch our lives (getting to do research on this). \n\n* Social media analytics apprenticeships that Stephanie did were related to current events like the Boston bombing and the Kenyan presidential elections of 2013.  She researched along with others how data collected from social media could be compared to the way news outlets covered the same events and how this could incite violent or peacemaking speech.  Check out Stephanie's LinkedIn (links at beginning of this show) to learn more! \n\n## 9:09 - Entertainment Influence on the West Coast \n\n* John noticed coming from southern California to northern California that both are company towns. \n\n* Southern California has proximity to the entertainment industry, and a large majority of what happens there is touched by that. \n\n* When John moved to northern California to work in the technology / software industry, this same phenomenon was not present any longer (i.e. not as many people writing movie scripts in the bay area, for example). \n\n* Stephanie's first internship was with a company called LiveFyre (a comment management system / platform often used on blogs), acting as an online community manager. \n\n* When she went back to Los Angeles (the following summer), she interned at a company called DS2DIO (a dance studio sponsored by YouTube). \n\n* Fun fact - Stephanie is also a hip hop dancer. \n\n* Through this experience she was able to be around a number of very talented dancers and help with production (on set).  She also did some research for them to help build a repository of dancers. \n\n* The next year she interned at Warner Brother Records in marketing and sales, doing some research in the music industry. \n\n* Around this time Stephanie realized she didn't really want to work in the entertainment industry as her first job and not get paid for it. \n\n* As a result, she went to every single career fair UCLA had to offer and found out Oracle was recruiting for sales and sales engineering positions. \n\n* At the time she had no idea what sales engineering was or really what Oracle was. \n\n* Stephanie's parents were very excited about her working for a stable technology company in the bay area. \n\n## 12:18 - Joining Oracle \n\n* Stephanie's parents had also underscored the importance of training no matter the industry she chose.  Oracle was offering 6 weeks of training and chose to say yes to the opportunity. \n\n* Later on she would be swept into the world of cloud technologies. \n\n* Stephanie had the sense all along that she wanted to rekindle the passion for entertainment, but there was not really a way to do this once she was working a 9-5 job in silicon valley. \n\n* It's interesting that Stephanie was not a computer science major but there was still active recruiting for roles in a software company which happened to be in sales and sales engineering. \n\n* John says Oracle is fairly well known for having \"class of\" programs in big cities (which Stephanie was a part of). \n\n* Just because you get hired does not necessarily mean you will be working there 5 years later. \n\n* Nick mentioned this sounds like the VMware Academy program through which college students are trained to become solution engineers / sales engineers (and many other potential roles). \n\n* Stephanie is thankful for the opportunity afforded to her by Oracle.  It set her on a path in her career to eventually be hired by Google Cloud. \n\n* Stephanie had tried attempted multiple times to get hired by Google Cloud right after school. \n\n* Being a part of the program at Oracle taught her both about sales engineering and enterprise technology. \n\n* Oracle started off in databases management and then acquired a number of SaaS companies (ERP system vendors, for example), and in 2014 they were really ramping the sales force up for cloud (part of the reason for the \"class of\" programs). \n\n* Sales engineering lined up more with what Stephanie wanted to do. \n\n* Being a part of the business intelligence and analytics sales engineering team complimented her digital humanities experience.  \n\n## 15:30 - A Customer Success Pivot \n\n* After 1.5 years at Oracle, she could sense that cloud technology was really starting to be a market mover.  There was a lot of traction around virtual machines, infrastructure-as-a-service, and platform-as-a-service. \n\n* Oracle decided to create its first database-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service products.  Stephanie decided to interview for a role on this team. \n\n* She wanted more implementation and onboarding experience with customers and gain a sharper skillset in these areas. \n\n* This customer success role and the sales engineering role are on opposite sides of the sale.  Listen to the way John describes the difference. \n\n* Stephanie mentioned the customer success management role was post sales and responsible for being the main point of contact for customers who had already purchased a service. \n\n* She and others in the role handled onboarding but also helped with implementing and consumption (since consumption was important for corporate revenue recognition). \n\n* Customer success personnel would also help with support issues and escalations, ensuring technical issues were resolved. \n\n* Stephanie and team managed the customer relationship and were also responsible for upselling a bit (encouraging expanding utilization or adding new products). \n\n* John mentions the concept of upselling goes back to grocery stores putting candy bars, beverages, and other items close to check out counters for that last minute impulse buy. \n\n* The skillset for customer success managers was a bit different from that of sales engineers according to Stephanie. \n\n* The customer success manager is managing a relationship that is more long term.  You are not just selling a product and passing it off to the team.  You are that team. \n\n* Instead of presenting on how the solution would work or doing a proof of concept you're helping to implement and ensure things are running smoothly. \n\n* If something does not work properly you're the first person the customer is going to speak with about it, and it creates a lot of accountability. \n\n* The technical topic set was a bit different than when Stephanie was on the sales engineering team.  She had to learn more about databases (which sometime had to be replicated across regions). \n\n* Some of the features of the platform were still being built out during this time. \n\n* Stephanie also had to learn how to spin up virtual machines, for example, and things such as these were important skills to learn as she wanted to transition to a different company. \n\n* Nick has seen in some cases where customer success is not a technical role but still a relationship role that supports consumption or helping customers adopt products / functionalities they already own. \n\n## 19:54 - Traditional and Non-Traditional Paths \n\n* Stephanie chose to make a move to a more technical role because she enjoyed learning, but it was a bit intimidating.  She lacked the traditional computer science / engineering background. \n\n* Stephanie feels like throughout her career she has known how to toe the line in such a way that she knows she will be comfortable and happy. \n\n* She's not the strongest software engineer out there and doesn't want to be.  Stephanie needs to be able to understand things at a level that allows her to meet others where they are and convey complex concepts in a way that truly helps.  This is her \"sweet spot.\" \n\n* John says there does not seem to be a traditional path into sales engineering / post-sales roles or for getting into IT operations (which can often be a precursor to these roles). \n\n* Nick was a math teacher who wandered into IT. \n\n* John was pursuing an economics degree. \n\n* Maybe the digital humanities studies are a more appropriate path into sales engineering than we might have considered? \n\n* When Stephanie first read the job description for sales engineering it sounded kind of in line with her degree.  It involved business communication and a little of the technical consulting. \n\n* Stephanie thought the role could work but didn't really know until she got into it. \n\n* A lot of people in the \"class of\" program with Stephanie came from different backgrounds (economics, film, some even had a digital humanities minor). \n\n* A number of people had gone into fields like mechanical engineering, for example.  Stephanie believed this would propel these individuals further in the industry because they were more \"technical.\"  That was not necessarily true as these folks needed to learn a new set of skills just like Stephanie. \n\n* This speaks to the idea that you should never let stereotypes affect your perception of the direction you should take, something Stephanie has continued being mindful of as her career grows. \n\n* These are self-induced limitations / blinders. \n\n## 23:35 - Saying No to a Dream Company \n\n* The same thing happened when Stephanie went into developer relations. \n\n* There are a large percentage of folks who believe to be in developer relations you need to be a strong software engineer.  That is true to be fair, but it's not the only way to get into the space. \n\n* In the developer relations space, Stephanie having an unconventional background is twice as true as for sales engineering. \n\n* The transition into developer relations happened 1.5 years or so after joining Google Cloud. \n\n* Toward the end of her time at Oracle, a number of people were leaving to pursue travel or other interests (medical school, some other role). \n\n* Stephanie decided she wanted to travel too, fully prepared to quit with no alternative plan. \n\n* At the time she learned Google Cloud was hiring sales representatives.  She didn't want to do that specific role and almost said no.  But then, she decided to move forward through the process to gain the experience.  If an offer was extended, she would then make a decision (since Google Cloud was somewhere she had always wanted to work). \n\n* Stephanie had applied 2 or 3 times in the past with one of them being an ad sales specialist and even a receptionist (to see if she could get her foot in the door and pivot). \n\n* Google Cloud extended an offer to Stephanie for the sales rep position, but it was not as compelling as she had hoped based on what she was making at Oracle, leading her to say no. \n\n* It was a tough decision, and she spoke to many people about it.  She followed her intuition and said no. \n\n* A couple months later when she was about to quit Oracle, Google Cloud let her know they had a sales engineering position open (more in line with what she wanted). \n\n* Stephane initially wanted to know if she needed to do the same set of interviews again.  They told her she had done half of them. \n\n* They needed her to do the technical interviews for the role and a presentation.  But she had already done the sales related interviews, and the team doing the hiring had recent enough notes on it. \n\n* Stephanie ended up going through this new round of interviews and preparing more for it than she ever has.  She was very intimidated but did the presentation and demo and got the job. \n\n* Instead of traveling for the length of time she wanted Stephanie traveled only for about a month before starting as a Google Customer Engineer (or sales engineer) in July 2017. \n\n* Stephanie knew early on Google was known for having a great and forward looking culture and wanted to experience it. \n\n* It seemed they (Google) valued work life balance, had less red tape, and hired great people. \n\n* Because of these factors she wanted to keep trying, classifying it as one of her dream companies. \n\n* Stephanie had to make sure that if she didn't get the job she would be ok and told herself this.  Google is not the only innovative company out there. \n\n* She also looked at what others were doing like pursuing graduate school, and getting education seemed like a logical next step. \n\n* Stephanie also applied to Stanford (a dream school of hers that she never got into), looking at various programs that were interesting like digital journalism. \n\n* She took the GRE and wrote her personal statement, using weekend time for the work.  In the midst of writing the personal statement she realized she was not passionate about the topic and was doing it for the wrong reasons. \n\n* Stephanie decided to drop the pursuit because it was not for the right reasons, understanding she could potentially pursue it later. \n\n* When it came to Google, she did the interviews afforded to her because it was a great challenge.  But she reminded herself not getting in is not the end of the world. \n\n* \"There are plenty of great companies out there, and if it's not a good fit, then it just wasn't meant to be.\" - Stephanie Wong \n\n* Nick admires Stephanie for being able to say no to a dream company. \n\n* If Stephanie had said yes to the sales rep role she feels it would have been harder to get to a technical role, realizing she could choose to wait and gain more experience. \n\n* At the time she had worked for Oracle for 3 years.  In the first couple years they (Google) said no.  But as she gained more experience Google was knocking down her door. \n\n* \"The right opportunities will come when you gain the right experience.\" - Stephanie Wong \n\n* Stephanie trusted that if she continued learning things would fall in line (and they did a couple of months later). \n\n* The take away from the Stanford example is when you feel something isn't sitting right, it probably isn't. \n\n* The people who will be evaluating you will notice this, and even if you do get it you won't truly be happy. \n\n* Stephanie chose to follow the things that were exciting and challenging (her pivot into joining the customer success management team at Oracle). \n\n* The take away from the Google turn down and eventually getting it is if something doesn't feel right that might sway your direction, talk to people and consider all factors. \n\n* Many things needed to come into the picture for Stephanie to say yes. \n\n## 32:53 - Back to Sales Engineering \n\n* The type of statement Stephanie would have to write to move forward with graduate school was in conflict with  how she actually felt. \n\n* It was kind of an experiment for Stephanie and was not the first time she attempted something similar. \n\n* In her last year of school she had attempted to apply to Harvard Business School through the 2+2 program but didn't make it (sort of a hail mary). \n\n* It was a good experience for her to realize that something was not fitting. \n\n* The personal statement for Stanford seemed like a reach.  It needed to express a passion for digital journalism, and Stephanie lacked some experience. \n\n* It seems like Stephanie had to go through a similar exercise when approaching the sales rep position at Google Cloud even if it didn't require writing a personal statement. \n\n* Every interview is a good exercise for interviewing the company and ensuring it is a fit. \n\n* Stephanie learned after the time spent with people going through the interview process for the sales rep position, maybe it was not the direction she wanted to go. \n\n* She at this point had 3 years experience as a sales engineer and better knew her interests in the industry. \n\n* Stephanie went back to sales engineering at Google (after being in customer success at Oracle as her most recent experience). \n\n* She wanted to get into Google and knew she had the right experience level. \n\n* The customer success manager role was similar to sales engineering in many ways (a number of transferrable skills, not a drastic change): \n\n* Working with customers \n\n* Helping consult on architectural decisions \n\n* Building out solutions for customers \n\n* Nick mentioned that some point have a certain level of comfort being on a certain side of the fence. \n\n* The role Stephanie was applying to at Google Cloud was on a team where she knew some of the people (good feedback on the team). \n\n* Financial incentives were different.  The [[Sales Quota|quota]] was more like a goal, tied to the entire team and not to one specific person. \n\n* Leveraging relationships before joining a company is a key to success (easier said than done). \n\n* John says he's had a number of folks contact him about working at Google Cloud.  It's helpful when you know people but not impossible to work around it. \n\n* Maybe there's also a blinder / limiting factor people have when working in pre or post-sales which prevents them from considering what success on the other side of the sale might look like. \n\n* Some people might shy away from pre-sales because you need to be motivated by competition, wanting to drive business goals. \n\n* Stephanie did not have a quota stress-inducing environment during her time on either side of the fence.  Some of this likely depends on the team. \n\n* When Stephanie joined Google Cloud she didn't know what post-sales teams were like.  She knew what the pre-sales team was like, had friends on it, and it met expectations for that first year. \n\n## 39:55 - Getting Past a Plateau \n\n* After that first year Stephanie thought she might be plateauing on the pre-sales team and started to consider other roles.  This led to exploring developer relations / advocacy…by accident. \n\n* She knew that developer relations was very technical and likely would not have considered it as an option. \n\n* Within a few months of joining Google Cloud Stephanie met another Customer Engineer who wanted to make YouTube videos for fun.  She thought that sounded great.  It was something she always wanted to do but did not know how to go about dong it. \n\n* Stephanie had a passion for both media and tech, and when this engineer suggested they do YouTube videos together it turned out to be exactly the kind of push she needed. \n\n* They ended up filming with cheap web cams and record in empty conference rooms (or wherever might be available). \n\n* They created demos, interviewed people, and would talk about most anything…posting it all on their YouTube channel called GCP Live. \n\n* This provided exposure but with no expectations. Stephanie didn't think it would lead to anything. \n\n* Stephanie's current manager reached out to both her and the other engineer because he was creating videos for developer relations and had access to budget.  The manager in question had a nice studio and asked Stephanie and her peer if they wanted to create some content in that studio. \n\n* Stephanie was able to leverage the videos as good evidence of performance as a Customer Engineer. \n\n* Nick's feedback is the metrics from the videos are evidence of making a wider impact, which is what is needed to advance. \n\n* This type of activity is not directly related to driving business, and some of the folks who were collaborating with Stephanie and her peer could not claim credit for these activities and were asked to stop. \n\n* The team Stephanie was on had a slightly different structure than others, and she was able to present it in the right way to her leadership.  She had helped charter an initiative showcase Google Cloud technologies to untapped new audiences with hundreds of thousands of views in the first few months. \n\n* Stephanie was able to excel in doing this work in addition to excelling in what was already expected of her.  You cannot take on things like if you let your primary responsibilities fall by the wayside. \n\n* Stephanie then got additional opportunities to gain visibility like being the broadcast host for [Google Cloud's Next conference](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next). \n\n* Through this experience she interviewed the director of developer relations. \n\n* This director shared that Stephanie's current boss was looking to start a team dedicated to creating online scalable content in the form of videos, podcasts, and other tutorials. \n\n* Stephanie was very intimidated by developer relations.  Her manager put her at ease, mentioning she could always learn more on the job.  The manager was looking for someone passionate about technical content creation. \n\n* This comes back to the lesson of looking for opportunities that excite yet challenge you. \n\n* At the time Stephanie was already considering a higher level Customer Engineer position, but it did not produce the same nervous excitement as the developer relations position. \n\n* Taking the position in developer relations jumpstarted Stephanie's career in a totally different direction than she ever expected. \n\n* It's interesting that Stephanie just jumped in and did some of these things without anyone asking her to do them.   \n\n* You have to remove the fear that what is produced will be imperfect when you begin because it will be.  Or as John says, you're definitely going to be bad at it in the beginning. \n\n* Stephanie and her team talk about this frequently and call it the first pancake principle.  The first pancake you make isn't going to be a good one, but the act of iterating and doing makes you better. \n\n* Do it because you want to, it's fun, and you have some sort of curiousity / interest in it.  The rest will fall into place. \n\n* Because Stephanie kept saying yes to things interesting to her like content creation, things started to come to her. \n\n* \"Luck is when hard work meets opportunity.\" - Stephanie Wong \n\n* In John's experience doing swing dancing, they would talk about the myth of the natural dancer (someone who was just born with the talent).  In reality the person was bad at it when you weren't around to watch. \n\n* Listen to John's story about a tap dancing instructor who could not remember when they were bad at tap dancing. \n\n* Be willing to be bad at something because the earlier you're bad, the sooner you can be good. \n\n* In the outro Nick and John reference [Episode 19](https://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/) on dreaming in bands and [Episode 80](https://nerd-journey.com/certification-and-mentoring-with-manny-sidhu/) with [[Manny Sidhu]] about catching a technology trend wave. [[Episode 19]] [[Episode 80]]\n\n* Also check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RllWIhjjVM) Stephanie created on \"How I Got My Dream Job at Google.\" \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-178":{"title":"Episode 178","content":"\n# Episode 178\n\nWelcome to episode 178 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 2 of an interview with Stephanie Wong, discussing her specialty of being a generalist, her approach to content creation, the transition to joining a developer relations team and becoming head of developer engagement, thoughts on diversity and inclusion, and some advice for high school students. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-13-2022 \n\n[Stephanie Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephrwong/) works for Google Cloud as the Head of Developer Engagement.  She is primarily a content creator and an engineer.  Catch part 1 of our interview with Stephanie in  [Episode 177](https://nerd-journey.com/follow-the-excitement-follow-the-challenge-with-stephanie-wong-1-2/).  [[Stephanie Wong]] [[Episode 177]] #GoogleCloud \n\nTopics – The #Craftsman's Approach to #ContentCreation, The #Generalist Triumphs, Changing the Measurements, Coming to a Head, Finding Your Voice; [[Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion]]; Advice for the High School Student and Parting Thoughts \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:33 - The Craftsman's Approach to Content Creation \n\n* Nick cites the craftman's approach to content creation which Stephanie took and the lack of concern to try and get it perfect.  Many of us fight perfectionism, especially if we can re-record something. \n\n* For live conference talks it's over when the time slot ends with no do-over.  When it is a pre-recorded piece of content, you can always make it better or tweak it before it is finalized. \n\n* Stephanie says she has seen excellent speakers for live talks freeze up when they get to a studio to record something.   \n\n* It's about practicing.  People have asked Stephanie if speaking on camera comes naturally to her, and it really does not.   \n\n* Over the last 4 years Stephanie has improved her speaking abilities tremendously.  She used to be stiff and not know what to do with her hands.   \n\n* Now, Stephanie can speak more naturally and be more expressive.  She has figured out what her voice and her style are. \n\n* Stephanie is also much more confident with the content she's presenting now, which definitely helps. \n\n* Watch out for the John White observation (not really a question  but an observation that often times produces great conversations). \n\n## 5:33 - The Generalist Triumphs \n\n* In John's experience at Google Cloud, there is a large portfolio of products that is continually growing.  How does Stephanie stay on top of this pattern? \n\n* Stephanie's opinion on this has changed.  When she first joined developer relations she was surrounded by some of the world's best engineers (i.e. software developers that made a pivot, people who were hired for their expertise in a specific domain, etc.). \n\n* As a generalist walking into developer relations Stephanie felt a number of shortcomings and a great deal of impostor syndrome. \n\n* She never felt like she was on top of everything.  However, the team was different than she thought.  People were hired onto it for their technical acumen and their ability to execute content for developers quickly and effectively (part of the very strong culture of the team). \n\n* Stephanie's expertise is not a specific technology or topic but rather the ability to distill the complex topics across the board for technical content creation. \n\n* People should realize you don't need to have a specialization in what we might call traditional methods.  Your specialization does not have to fit within the box. \n\n* Nick says it sounds like the team needs members who can teach the content in such a way that it meets the audience where they are. \n\n* Stephanie says this can help in so many roles in the tech industry (not just developer relations but sales engineering and many others).  If you can get good at this you can be successful in just about any role or organization. \n\n* Being an expert in one domain isn't Stephanie.  She can certainly do it, but she really enjoys being a great generalist (her desired direction) and will double down on it. \n\n* Stephanie will go deep enough in an area to make her successful and leverage the network around her if more assistance is needed.  Knowing the resources around you and the network you have at hand is a powerful skill. \n\n* John references our discussion of the [Generalist / Specialist Divide](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-026-generalist-specialist-divide/) and how these terms can sometimes lose their meanings. \n\n* John gives a great example of various layers of generalist and specialists inside VMware from his time there (i.e. his network \"specialist\" might be considered a network \"generalist\" inside a business unit with more specialists with an even more narrow focus). \n\n* Stephanie says it's important to remind yourself of what you find interesting and decide to focus on it. \n\n* If you want to learn more and work toward a job that requires you to learn more, do it.  But don't compare yourself to people who have more experience in that area. \n\n* This is something Stephanie had to fight when she was in developer relations being around so many talented engineers. \n\n* The ways the team was getting measured were different than it had been done historically (i.e. new metrics).  \n\n* It took years of building credibility and showing that the content she made was valuable to a developer audience. \n\n## 11:00 - Changing the Measurements \n\n* Stephanie thinks there was some skepticism from the team in the beginning that a Customer Engineer was coming to developer relations and the value of doing online content creation. \n\n* Stephanie had to push through, build partnerships with executives, and produce great work. \n\n* It's important to be great at what you do not only from a craftsmanship point of view, but also build the relationships to get your work in front of the right people so they can advocate for you.  \n\n* The director who introduced Stephanie to her manager was the one who was a true sponsor, advocating for her work and providing public recognition where it was due. \n\n* This convinced the rest of the organization to give Stephanie a bit more respect. \n\n* John can sympathize with the skepticism in changing metrics.  Some of that is inertia against the way things have historically been done. \n\n* Stephanie says you have to be careful with vanity metrics.  Maybe she gave a talk for 300 people live but colleagues had online content with thousands of views.  What makes one better than the other? \n\n* Evaluations eventually became centered on the complexity of what the team was doing and providing value to stakeholders (product, marketing, engineering, others).  \n\n* It took time to build the right benchmarks and standards across teams.  Developer relations is broader than you might think and can be somewhat undefined. \n\n* This sounds like the tyranny of the metric.  The metric is just one expression of value / one way to express success. \n\n* None of us are envious of those doing performance evaluations based on metrics. \n\n## 15:33 - Coming to a Head \n\n* As Head of Developer Relations, Stephanie is not currently a people manager but will likely be soon. \n\n* Last year Stephanie was presented an opportunity by her current director.  He was speaking to marketing teams, and they wanted a single, central voice for Google Cloud launches as it relates to developers. \n\n* They wanted consistent content production from someone who could provide an authentic take on why the launches matter to the developer community.  Stephanie stepped up to the plate to take on this ambiguous role and helped build it from the ground up (building a process behind it, building relationships with various groups, etc.). \n\n* Stephanie now has her ear to the ground for any product launches, coming out with multi-pronged approach to the content creation and releases (videos, blog posts, social media management, etc.) so that it gets to the heart of what developers care about (i.e. moreso than just product marketing). \n\n* For the first 6-8 months Stephanie was writing everything to help find her voice as a thought leader in the industry. \n\n* This involved researching, taking in information from product teams, etc. \n\n* She had been in developer relations for 3 years at this point and was used to these types of tasks (i.e. taking on creating series of content to teach back to people), but this time it was a faster pace and much more context switching. \n\n* It was a good fit for her skills and a great way to advance Stephanie's career to be more of a face of Google Cloud. \n\n* This has been a very rewarding experience, and Stephanie has formed a team to which she has been able to delegate a bit of the content writing. \n\n## 18:31 - Finding Your Voice \n\n* Stephanie's biggest tip is to start writing and talking about topics. \n\n* Two years ago Stephanie did a series called [Eyes on Enterprise](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIivdWyY5sqLe8E4YAeEGhunnQr38wtLK).  She wanted to bring in experts and ask them hard-hitting questions.  Stephanie remembers it being very…memorized. \n\n* She would ask a question, make a small comment, and then move on to the next question because she was nervous and didn't quite know how to respond adequately. \n\n* After continuing to do it, adding a lot of research, and picking up the podcast in 2021 Stephanie decided to fully throw herself into the fire. \n\n* If she didn't know something she would ask questions out of pure curiosity and was ok with not being the expert in the room.  Eventually she would roll with whatever conversations and now feels she knows new topics at a very comfortable level of depth (i.e. networking and Kubernetes, for example). \n\n* Be patient is the lesson here. \n\n* Consider some strategies to help.  When you read a book or a white paper, you will only retain a minimal percentage of information from that first consumption experience (even if you highlight). \n\n* When you start to retrieve the information, process it, and teach it back to others you start learning. \n\n* John references some discussions on deep learning we did (check out [Episode 156](https://nerd-journey.com/better-notes-better-you-with-josh-duffney-1-2/) and [Episode 157](https://nerd-journey.com/take-note-of-your-time-with-josh-duffney-2-2/) for more on the [[Smart Notes]] methodology).  [[Episode 156]] [[Episode 157]] [[Josh Duffney]]\n\n* A large part of the learning process is the teaching part. \n\n* Often times when you're taking notes the person you are teaching is your future self.  And eventually you progress to teaching others. \n\n* Being able to explain a concept to someone else is a great test of your knowledge of the concept. \n\n* Probably 90% of what Stephanie does is distilling complex topics into an exciting and fun narrative that delights developers. \n\n* Stephanie uses the analogy of [database sharding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture) as a good way to think about the strategy. \n\n* People have different learning styles to consider as well.  You can maximize reach of the content by converting into different formats. \n\n* The way someone creates the shards of content is often a reflection of how their brain works and may be very different from how someone else would do it. \n\n## 23:15 - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion \n\n* In John's experience, Google Cloud has been very proud of their work in this area.  How has it impacted Stephanie in terms of her identity and the cultural make up of the teams she has worked on? \n\n* Diversity of thought on the teams where Stephanie has worked has been great. \n\n* People may get stuck on whether they are creating a blog post correctly, for example.  Audiences appreciate how you learned a concept and what the process was in your case. \n\n* The content they create on Stephanie's team is very valuable (all of it).  There is some guidance on how to create content quickly / get ideas down by using some proven methodologies. \n\n* Learning and applying the knowledge on paper to start with is great. \n\n* This is also related to impostor syndrome.  People might feel inadequate because they have a different background (like Stephanie did) and a different way of learning concepts. \n\n* When you look at teams in tech you might not see someone who has the same background as you or even looks like you.  To get over this you need to put more content out there from your perspective. \n\n* In terms of Stephanie's identity there were some microaggressions and stereotypes in the beginning.  But in the most recent years, she has realized being proud of who you are and bringing all of your external interests into the open is great.  You control the narrative and leave no room for interpretation this way. \n\n* Stephanie showcases her pageant and dance background because it is important to show other people that they can be multi-dimensional in the tech industry (especially for women of color).  This has served her well. \n\n* When she first joined the ranks of engineers, Stephanie felt like she had to look and dress like the other engineers, afraid that the background would not help her.  For the longest time until very recently Stephanie felt she needed to change who she was to fit the role of the engineer. \n\n* John says in dance people often take on what they think a person dancing a certain way is supposed to look like (and maybe what they act like) when they are doing it (i.e. fit into a pre-conceived stereotype). \n\n* For Stephanie there were multiple angles to it.  She felt she needed to learn technical skills and be proficient programming in one language, enjoy doing demos, do live talks, and ensure the level of the content was at 200 or more. \n\n* Stephanie did not feel like she could be super fashionable (feeling she needed to be a super serious engineer) and ended up dressing down. \n\n* The two aspects were looks and the job function itself. \n\n* It's important to evaluate what is important to the goal you have in mind.  Stephanie gives a great comparison of a ballet dancer compared to a freestylist.  Listen to see if you agree. \n\n* At the beginning you start to imitate something.  The phases would be imitation, variation, and then innovation (not so different from musical artists either). \n\n* Stephanie says she is in the 3rd phase now - less afraid to be who she is, dressing up when she wants to, and embracing her pageant experience. \n\n* There was a period where didn't do this because of a feeling of needing to prove herself. \n\n* Her advice to others is always be authentic.  Don't be afraid of your passions, interests, and identity.  Once you control the narrative from the beginning it leaves little room for interpretation. \n\n* Stephanie feels that cloud is changing and very welcoming to people of different backgrounds, non-technical backgrounds, people from all over the world, etc. \n\n* Stereotypes about the technology field and how to break into it are starting to change.  Stephanie attributes this to all the people willing to share their career journey. \n\n* The industry is so young it cannot afford to be stodgy.   \n\n* Stephanie feels fortunate to have entered the job market when it was exploding. \n\n* Companies cannot look for the traditional candidates of years past.  They need to look at people learning the new technologies, pushing the industry forward and eager minded professionals (students, people from all parts of the world, etc.). \n\n## 33:32 - Advice for the High School Student and Parting Thoughts \n\n* Nick has seen many Reddit threads from high school students not knowing what they want to do for a career. \n\n* Stephanie struggled with the concept that she had to find her passion in life and that there was only one passion. \n\n* Not finding it meant struggling, and finding it meant she would never work a real day in her life. \n\n* This is outdated.  There are so many paths in life with everything being temporary. \n\n* Stephanie found a passion through trying a bunch of different things and increased effort in these areas. \n\n* You have to try different things.  If you are teetering between many choices, follow your intuition (i.e. feels right, feels challenging and exciting). \n\n* The things Stephanie did were bridged together through her saying yes to things that gave her more visibility, let her learn new things, etc. \n\n* In high school she had no idea how to pick up a major.  She picked up communications because she was forced to do it at the end of her sophomore year.   \n\n* There is no requirement to figure everything out.  Life is a journey.  The role Stephanie is in now did not even exist 4 years ago (i.e. no way for a younger high school age Stephanie to aspire to this role). \n\n* To the high school student, don't think about it too much.  The next 3 years are going to look totally different than they do now. \n\n* You can identify things you are passionate about and good at over time and have some faith that the roles which may combine those things may not even exist today or may exist by the time you are ready to step into them. \n\n* In high school you haven't experienced enough of life yet.  There is a whole world out there of different paths to take.  You're barely scratching the surface of what life has to offer. \n\n* \"How are you expected to know what your passions are if you haven't even seen everything that the world has to offer?\" - Stephanie Wong \n\n* Stephanie was terrified when she graduated from college, envying her peers who pursued the medical field that had a more structured path forward. \n\n* In hindsight she is glad it worked out the way it did (an open ended future). \n\n* If social media has taught her anything it is that you can be someone who does TikTok, YouTube, an entrepreneur, or someone who doesn't even work in corporate America.  You can make your own position. \n\n* If you want to follow up with Stephanie, you can find her \n\n* On Twitter -

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss what Nick's been up to while John was on parental leave including some career advice from executive leaders, a burnout revisit, and thoughts on impostor syndrome.  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-25-2022 \n\nTopics – Catching up with Nick, Career Advice from Executive Leaders, Almost Burnout, A Disconnected Vacation, The Gift of Feedback, Success and Impostor Syndrome \n\n=========================== \n\n## 00:56 - Catching up with Nick \n\n* In  [Episode 176](https://nerd-journey.com/planning-for-and-taking-leave-as-a-new-parent/) we covered John's experience with parental leave (planning for it, going on it, and coming back from it). [[Episode 176]] [[Parental Leave]] This week we're going to speak to Nick's experience during the same time frame (while running the show in John's absence) and cover two major topics: \n\n* Career advice from executive leaders \n\n* How burnout almost got Nick \n\n## 2:10 - Career Advice from Executive Leaders \n\n* Nick was in the audience for a panel discussion with a number of executive leaders across HR, sales, and product and engineering teams.  He asked one question of the panel - \"what is one piece of career advice you would give to people in this audience?\"  Here are some of the responses: \n\n* Excel at what you do today, and make it known to your boss that you want to advance in regular 1-1s. \n\n* Companies have lost talent because not one knew an individual wanted to advance / it was not communicated. \n\n* If you aren't doing well and meeting your core responsibilities, that is step 1.  Then you have to communicate the desire to advance up the leadership chain. \n\n* There are people who want to remain where they are and excel in the role for a number of reasons - personal reasons, not wanting to take on added responsibility, work / life balance, really enjoying what they do, etc. \n\n* It is not a given to a manager that someone wants to move up, advance, or change what they are doing (needs to be communicated).  If you are not having a weekly 1-1s with your manager, you need to ask for them.  \n\n* See also [Episode 45](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-045-career-conversations-with-your-manager/) on career conversations with your manager to help with the discussion on advancement. \n\n* Managers can sniff out the people who just want to talk about career all the time without having done the work to justify progression to a higher title or different position. \n\n* Even if not executing at a high level, it's ok to communicate to your manager that your long term goal is to is to do really well and then progress. \n\n* Looking forward too much may cause you to take the present for granted or be less present to enjoy what is happening now.  Balance the looking forward and planning for the future with working on the here and now. \n\n* Another panelist said the greatest growth they experienced was during times when jumping into something new.  We should not be afraid to do that.  This person liked to make a 3-5 year plan for their career and make decisions based on it. \n\n* If you are comfortable, you are not growing. \n\n* Growth involves doing something you aren't good at yet (kind of the definition of growing). \n\n* We should remember how much we can learn when we go and do something different. \n\n* It's important to remember what it is like to be in the process of growth where you're not the expert.  It helps us show empathy to others going through this same process. \n\n* This makes Nick think back to Steven Murawski and the mention of the beginner mindset back in [Episode 106](https://nerd-journey.com/exploring-the-beginner-mindset-with-steven-murawski-part-2/).  [[Episode 106]]\n\n* Be self-aware enough to know your strengths so that when opportunities open up to do something different you can take advantage and match your strengths to the requirements for a new role. \n\n* Some of this you may be able to get through feedback (things others see that you do not see in yourself). \n\n* What is it you are interested in doing?  Sometimes that is the same as what you're good at doing (i.e. your skills) but likely not a 100% intersection.  \n\n* We should recognize what we are good at doing, even if we don't like to do it.   \n\n* Be aware of skills that may not immediately translate to a job you can think of today.  If we think back to [[Episode 178]]  [Episode 178](https://nerd-journey.com/being-a-great-generalist-and-finding-your-voice-with-stephanie-wong-2-2/) with [[Stephanie Wong]], remember she had a background in communications, being a dancer, and digital humanities which eventually led her into developer relations (not something on her radar when she was in school because it did not exist then). \n\n* Do not assume people know you want or what you need. \n\n* It's one thing to make it known that you want to advance, but you may have certain needs in a position you are / want to pursue (more support, help on a project, more space for a personal project, greater flexibility of schedule, etc.).  Make a conscious effort to make these known also. \n\n* This discussion reminds Nick of a recent trip to the Grand Canyon in which he and his family rented bikes to ride up to look out points (in high heat(. \n\n* The ride started off with a nice downhill coast to the bottom of a rather large hill.   \n\n* It took struggle (sometimes getting off the bike and walking) to get up the hill to the point where everyone agreed it would be wise to turn around.  But the best part was coasting down the hill. \n\n* Perhaps the ride down is like a reward for all the work put in on the way up (i.e. the work to make something new for you possible).  It doesn't mean you won't be placed at the bottom of another huge hill soon though.   \n\n* You can't expect your career to be a series of downhill bike rides. \n\n* When things are made easy for you the payoff isn't as big. \n\n## 14:58 - Almost Burnout \n\n* Nick mentioned in [Episode 161](https://nerd-journey.com/booking-the-time-to-read-in-2022/) that he really enjoys reading biographies and has continued the trend this year of reading almost exclusively biographies so far in 2022.  [[Episode 161]]\n\n* Nick ended up reading [Mellencamp](https://www.amazon.com/Mellencamp-Paul-Rees/dp/198211214X) by [[Paul Rees]]. [[Mellencamp]] \n\n* Mellencamp suffered panic attacks when he was younger (early 20s).  Despite the fact that he stopped drinking, he drank lots of coffee, was a chain smoker, and didn't get a lot of sleep…leaving him somewhat on edge. \n\n* Mellencamp demanded a lot from the people be worked with (the band, production team, etc.). \n\n* He had a great memory for music, which Nick believes may have come from John Mellencamp's dyslexia. \n\n* One night as he was becoming very popular, Mellencamp brought the house down and quit the tour.  He said he was angry with the fans, holding them responsible for him having to be out there. \n\n* \"I found myself on top…but with nothing there of any interest…or at least nothing I was interested in.\" - John Mellencamp \n\n* Nick read the story and thought \"that could be me.\"  It hit close to home (the burnout aspect). \n\n* Mellencamp had been taught to paint at a young age by his mother.  When he quit the tour he decided he would tour only when he was ready, converting his garage into a studio for painting.   \n\n* He became hard to reach and would paint for hours, getting distance from the situations.  The music started to come back, and he wrote the music he wanted instead of what he thougth w \n\n* John finds it interesting that these patterns cross industries (not just tech). \n\n* Being driven forward, very little sleep, lots of stimulants (coffee), and losing the love of the thing - this happens to tech professionals too. \n\n* Getting called on the weekends, working 80 hour weeks, and getting calls in the middle of the night can all make someone forget why they loved technology in the first place. \n\n* Mellencamp was pushed to the breaking point.  Not everyone is and can stop it before that happens. \n\n## 19:19 - A Disconnected Vacation \n\n* Nick went on vacation a few weeks before John's parental leave started in March, feeling like it was a bad time to be away from work. \n\n* There were a number of important projects in flight, and Nick was not sure he could take a 100% disconnected vacation. \n\n* Nick was encouraged to keep the vacation [[Unplugging from Work|disconnected from work]], and he did.  Thank you to those who encouraged this! \n\n* The vacation was great.  During that time, Nick listened to [The Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Shipping-Creative-Work/dp/0593328973) by Seth Godin again. \n\n* In the book there were excerpts about the practice of [morning pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/).  \n\n* It was a time of change for Nick and his family.   \n\n* His daughter was changing schools, which required research and discussion. \n\n* They were trying to decide when to return to in-person worship services. \n\n* Nick also felt a little overwhelmed at work. \n\n* He was working late into the night and checking e-mail as soon as he woke up to make sure nothing was missed (back into a bad habit).   \n\n* All these things together made Nick feel like he needed to slow things down so he wouldn't \"quit the tour\" one day. \n\n* John references some episodes that stuck out to him after hearing all this: \n\n* [Episode 82](https://nerd-journey.com/why-vacation-wont-cure-burnout-and-effective-mental-health-days-off/) - Why Vacation Won’t Cure Burnout and Effective Mental Health Days Off \n\n* [Episode 78](https://nerd-journey.com/burnout-and-recovery-with-josh-fidel/) - Burnout and Recovery with Josh Fidel \n\n* Just taking time off didn't help Josh. \n\n* We as workers and as members of families and communities need to recognize what burnout is (or evidence of it) - elevated stress hormones, suppressed immune response, lack of sleep, lack of motivation, etc. \n\n* See also [Job Burnout: How to Spot It and Take Action](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642) \n\n## 23:01 - The Gift of Feedback \n\n* Without hearing so many [stories of burnout](https://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2021/12/24/burned-out-for-the-holidays/) on the show combined with the books he read, Nick might not have seen this coming. \n\n* Nick talked to some people about feeling overwhelmed.  The feedback he received was that he need not go straight to using sandpaper (i.e. extreme effort). \n\n* The spirit of the advice was getting to good enough in certain scenarios and accepting it.  You cannot overclock the CPU all the time, or it will overheat. \n\n* As John describes it, calibrate the level of effort and stress based on the task at hand's needs. \n\n* This feedback Nick received was a gift because he was neglecting self-care. \n\n* Nick shares more detail on morning pages and his experience giving it a try. \n\n* Each day, write 3 pages about anything you want by hand in a notebook somewhere.  Most people do it first thing in the morning, but it doesn't have to be that way.  \n\n* It doesn't matter what the pages are about.  What matters is that you write them. \n\n* As of this recording, Nick is roughly 100 days into morning pages.  He wrote at least something each day but on a couple of the days was not able to get to 3 pages. \n\n* Writing like this allows you to let your mind spin on whatever you want (the goal). \n\n* The pages are meant to be honest and designed to get things out of your head for increased focus and clarity.   \n\n* You will see quickly what is occupying your thoughts. \n\n* It is ironic that during a time of overwhelm doing something like this (morning pages) can allow you to slow things down so you feel less overwhelmed. \n\n* The stress and cortisol response was decreased as a result of this exercise and allowed for higher productivity during the day. \n\n* The practice of morning pages helped Nick to not feel like he was going a million miles per hour inside for a little while. \n\n* John asks if you're supposed to go back and read what was written and do some analysis. \n\n* Some say don't go back and read it again. \n\n* Nick says the writing can help clarify something (i.e. an idea, an opinion you hold, motivations for something, etc.). \n\n* The writing may highlight a bad situation or certain things that drain your energy.  It could be a specific incident, a specific process, destructive patterns, etc. \n\n* Nick advises don't approach the pages in a way that expects immediate results.  Take the process over outcomes mentality we mentioned in [Episode 19](https://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/). \n\n* The benefits are gained by following a process, creating structure and safety. \n\n* John has heard about the practice of [freewriting](https://writingprocess.mit.edu/process/step-1-generate-ideas/instructions/freewriting) and feels morning pages may be a variation of this. \n\n* Freewriting requires that you start writing and then you don't stop writing, even if there is no new thought in your head.  Over time you get down to the ideas in your head. \n\n* To Nick this sounds like what Ben Folds said in his biography, A Dream about Lightning Bugs, about turning on the brown water and letting it run so you can get to the clear water (a process to get to a good idea by being willing to write down ones you feel are bad). \n\n* This separates the editing from ideation process. \n\n* Nick tried to combine morning pages with getting more sleep (or trying to), especially after speaking to [[Evan Oldford]] about prioritizing sleep in [[Episode 173]] [Episode 173](https://nerd-journey.com/collect-your-portfolio-with-evan-oldford-2-2/). \n\n* And he tried to get more activity (taking walks, etc.). \n\n* Getting more distance from our work is important for all of us. \n\n* Maybe you have a specific shutdown routine and set a boundary like not going into a specific room, for example.  Not everyone has the luxury of leaving the room where they work to get distance. \n\n* One boundary could be not checking e-mail after a certain time until the next morning. \n\n* This may have something to do with managing notifications and interruptions.  See also our [[Deep Work]] series starting with [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/) and ending with [Episode 147](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-7-become-hard-to-reach/). [[Episode 141]] [[Episode 147]] [[Cal Newport]]\n\n* Nick believed this process has helped him pull back a little bit.  There is a little bit more of a boundary he's working to hold. \n\n* John says the amount of stress and anxiety you have about something is not correlated to how effectively you are working at the thing. \n\n* You can de-stress and lower anxiety levels and me more effective, and that's ok. \n\n* Adding one more thing to your day that could take 30 minutes or more is a barrier for people. Saying they need to write by hand is yet another. \n\n* Writing the pages is also a time to avoid distractions if at all possible (no getting interrupted by your phone and maybe even putting it in a separate room, etc.).   \n\n* Not everyone has to be good at things.  Not everyone has to do things that improve themselves.  Not everyone has to advance their careers.  We are here to talk about techniques out there to help people do things better, which involves effort and work and sometimes additional tasks. \n\n* Neither John nor Nick will say this is easy. \n\n## 39:13 - Success and Impostor Syndrome \n\n* Nick also read [Petty: The Biography](https://www.amazon.com/Petty-Biography-Warren-Zanes-audiobook/dp/B017OD6XTM/) by Warren Zane. \n\n* Even though he was not somoene who liked to party, Petty got deep into drugs and deep into depression. \n\n* There is a craftsmanship element to what musicians do. \n\n* Think about being someone who wants to break into the music industry and then gets very quick fame (i.e. hit record catches on well). \n\n* There is a cycle of writing, getting help with production, releasing and promotion of an album, touring (which could be 18 months), and then you are on the hook to turn out a new album. \n\n* No one teaches you how to deal with that kind of success. \n\n* Think about an artist who has a platinum record but doesn't have the next album do well (too much pressure).  There is impostor syndrome lurking here. \n\n* Trying to duplicate success for technologists can often times create impostor syndrome and a desire for perfection. \n\n* We feel there is a similar trope for technologists as for musicians - you had your whole life to build up skills to get to this position and have 2 performance cycles to advance to the next level.   \n\n* You have to deal with your own success.  Maybe it's a bigger environment or more influence. \n\n* When we reach what is for us amazing levels of success, we don't often say \"ok, I'm there\" and enjoy it like [[Don Jones]] indicated at the beginning of [Episode 138](https://nerd-journey.com/apprentice-amplifier-and-people-developer-with-don-jones-2-2/). [[Episode 138]]\n\n* See [Episode 137](https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/), [Episode 85](https://nerd-journey.com/impostor-syndrome-anxiety-and-effective-listening-with-cody-de-arkland/), or [Episode 10](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-010-seven-month-check-in-and-impostor-syndrome/) for talk on [[Impostor Syndrome]]. [[Episode 137]] [[Episode 85]] [[Episode 10]]\n\n* This (impostor syndrome) is a fascinating pattern that crosses industries.  We need to be better about recognizing these, but they sometimes get ignored. \n\n* People think their impostor syndrome is special. \n\n* The beginner mindset allows you to be ok with what is happening and that you don't know everything right now, which may make it harder to fall into impostor syndrome.   \n\n* See also [Episode 106](https://nerd-journey.com/exploring-the-beginner-mindset-with-steven-murawski-part-2/) and [Episode 107](https://nerd-journey.com/applying-the-beginner-mindset-in-major-job-transitions-steven-murawski-part-3/) with [[Steve Murawski]]. [[Episode 106]] [[Episode 107]] \n\n* Take joy in the early stages of learning, of discomfort if you're able, and it becomes more difficult to get overwhelmed.  Discomfort may indicate growth. \n\n* Notice Nick did not talk much about running the podcast while John was away. He does not feel like that in and of itself was a stressor like other things, but it was a time pressure. \n\n* For Nick, spending time on the podcast is a form of craftsmanship, almost like therapy. \n\n* There were some times when he wondered if he would have time to finish getting an episode release.  But he wasn't willing to let it drop. \n\n* Sometimes it's a million paper cuts that can bring us down. \n\n* Check out [Nick's blog post on adopting morning pages](https://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2022/05/24/the-pages-dont-lie/) and his post on [stories of burnout](https://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2021/12/24/burned-out-for-the-holidays/). \n\n* Nick says [[Jonathan Frappier]] was right in [Episode 132](https://nerd-journey.com/riding-the-burnout-wave-with-jonathan-frappier-2-2/) when he spoke about riding the burnout wave. [[Episode 132]]\n\n* Nick didn't know he would need the advice at the time, but he knows he needed it now! \n\n* Part of the reason we do show notes is so people can refer back to episodes and topics for help when they need it. \n\n* Maybe John should make tags more easily accessible on the Nerd Journey site (in addition to the search box)? \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-180":{"title":"Episode 180","content":"\n# Episode 180\n\nWelcome to episode 180 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 1 of an interview with Bill Kindle, discussing his entry into the technology field through vocational school, experience at MSPs, learning the importance of customer service, and constantly aspiring to grow professionally. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 03-14-2022 \n\nTopics – Meet [[Bill Kindle]], Learn a Vocation, Constantly Learning and Shifting, Lessons Learned at Walmart, Focus on Customer Service, Goodwill, Spiceworks Community, Other Connections, Out of Nonprofit Space, Bored and Recruited \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:49 - Meet Bill Kindle \n\n* [Bill Kindle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billkindle/) is a #Cybersecurity Engineer and has been in IT over 20 years, doing a little bit of everything over that time period. \n\n* As a teenager Bill would play around on his aunt aunt and uncle's computer (which ran [Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95)).   \n\n* After playing a lot of Nascar he got introduced to [Mario Teaches Typing](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Mario_Teaches_Typing_1992) \n\n* After tinkering with this Bill began to do some basic web design upon entering high school.  Part of his study hall period was normally spent tinkering on a computer in the classroom. \n\n* Bill was able to talk his aunt into buying him a book on how to build computers.  He later saved some paper route money and leveraged it to buy some computer parts and build his own PC. \n\n* People started paying Bill to take viruses off their computers once they knew he was capable.  Getting $30 or $40 is a lot to a teenager, and the money he made generally was used as gas money. \n\n* Bill's family suggested he go to school to study computers.  A guidance counselor encouraged him to tour a trade school in the area, and he did that for his last 2 years of high school, studying information studying computer information systems and computer networking. \n\n* It came pretty easy to Bill, and he did better there than at his high school. \n\n* Bill later attended [ITT Technical Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITT_Technical_Institute) and got his associate's degree. \n\n## 6:22 - Learn A Vocation \n\n* The vocational school was a joint vocational school to learn trades while in high school. \n\n* Bill is a huge proponent of vocational schooling.  College may not for everyone, but that does not mean you cannot learn a skill.  Many trades out there need skilled people, and learning a skill can help you no matter what you do in your career. \n\n* It was not hard for Bill to find a job or side work doing IT after high school.   \n\n* He is extremely grateful for the early conversations with family and the guidance counselor mentioned.  It has not let him down yet. \n\n* Nick mentions Reddit posts about high school students not knowing what to do with their career direction, usually encouraging them to go and get experience in something. \n\n* Sometimes you have to do a couple of different jobs before you figure out what you don't want to do. \n\n* Bill has known folks who learned how to lay bricks and stud walls, skills he wished he had.  Bill has even considered going back to school to learn some of these types of skills. \n\n* Getting the experience through his vocational school was priceless (and a turning point) for Bill. \n\n* Bill recommends that any high school student check out vocational / trade schools as an option. \n\n* John sees technology trades closely associated with the apprentice system we see for electricians / plumbers / carpenters, for example. \n\n* Before you can be a master electrician you have to be an apprentice and a journeyman (part of the reason for John's Twitter handle of @vJourneyman).   \n\n* There's nothing really like this system in the technology industry. \n\n* People don't realize how good of a living you can make in some of the trades that aren't as \"popular.\"  As a result viable trade schools and specific trades may be getting ignored (i.e. nurse, electrician, carpenter, etc.). \n\n* Bill is thankful the vocational experience was there, and it started with someone telling him about it. \n\n* Many of the things that Bill learned during school are now obsolete / outdated / irrelevant.  That happens in IT, and Bill said he had to be ok with constantly learning in this industry. \n\n## 11:05 - Constantly Learning and Shifting \n\n* For those with kids listening (of any age), it's important for all of us to be mindful of what our kids are interested, to help them learn about themselves, and help them learn about what they could do with the skills they already have. \n\n* This is hitting Nick harder and harder as he spends time on Reddit and continues speaking with people on the podcast. \n\n* Bill has felt strongly about trade schools for a long time and applying that to our industry.  It was refreshing for him to read Be the Master by Don Jones (see [Episode 137](https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/) and [Episode 138](https://nerd-journey.com/apprentice-amplifier-and-people-developer-with-don-jones-2-2/)), one of the most influential he has read. \n\n* The latest iteration of this is [Own Your Tech Career](https://www.amazon.com/Own-Your-Tech-Career-technologists/dp/1617299073) by Don Jones. \n\n* You can juxtapose the stories on top of what we do today. \n\n* Bill hopes to one day see a shift away from people hoarding knowledge but to sharing knowledge more often. \n\n* John says if people hold onto something they learn and hope the world is not going to change around them, it is unrealistic to continue to believe this and can make you irrelevant.  \n\n* None of us made it to where we are without a hand up or a little push forward from others.  One of the reasons we started the podcast was to help people understand some of those possible paths forward. \n\n* John says when he went through high school and college he saw his path as something that must be linear, with anything else being failure.  That is not true (since his career has been very much nonlinear). \n\n## 15:24 - Lessons Learned at Walmart \n\n* Unfortunately for Bill, no one wanted to hire an IT person straight out of high school even with strong grades and provable skills.  He lacked certifications.  \n\n* Bill needed a job, and they were building a new Wal-Mart Supercenter near him.  He went to a local store, filled out a paper application, and heard nothing back (even though they were actively hiring). \n\n* Bill walked back in and got 25 paper applications, took them home, and filled every one of them out by hand.  The next day he dropped them off at the store. \n\n* Bill received a call not long after this that they wanted him to come in for an interview (part of a mass hiring event). \n\n* He ended up being interviewed by the store's co-manager who had all 26 applications stacked together.  She told him for someone as young as Bill to fill out that many applications it was only fitting that she call him. \n\n* Bill got the job and worked with the lady who interviewed him for about 3 years, learning a lot about retail and people in the process. \n\n* Customer service is a lost art to a lot of people.  Bill's managers drilled the importance of this into the employees every single day.  The managers empowered the employees to make decisions (at all levels).  It's been a rarity in Bill's career to have management like that. \n\n* Bill knew he didn't want to stay with Wal-Mart long term. \n\n* He had interviewed for a management training program there but was not accepted. \n\n* Bill kept trying to break into Wal-Mart IT, but it didn't go anywhere. \n\n* After trying a couple of different things he decided to look for greener pastures. \n\n* Bill ended up doing an internship at the vocational school he had attended earlier. \n\n* John makes the observation that Bill had a vision for either progressing or leaving.  After pursuing multiple avenues that were not going to pan out, the only choice was leaving. \n\n* There were a few times where people would ask Bill to setup the computers he sold at Wal-Mart at their homes for a little side money, which kept him excited about IT and allowed a little moonlighting. \n\n## 21:41 - Focus on Customer Service \n\n* Most all of Bill's customer service skills came from his time at Wal-Mart.  The managers during that time were very people oriented and would go above and beyond.   \n\n* Bill tries to keep these lessons in mind when he helps people even now. \n\n* It would be extremely beneficial for anyone in IT (regardless of your level, even if you are just getting started) to do some type of work that involves dealing with people on a regular basis. \n\n* You will learn so much about people, what makes them happy, and what makes them mad. \n\n* This is about listening to someone's problem and trying to help the person resolve it. \n\n* You will learn to spot those who genuinely want / need help and those who need to be heard.  You may have to be the person that lends an ear so someone feels they are being heard. \n\n* Bill says working retail (even for a short term) could be a rite of passage for IT professionals because of what you learn doing it.  There are not many IT jobs where you don't have to interact with others in some way. \n\n* John's wife shared an article with him about the [hidden costs of emotional labor](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/12/why-our-culture-undervalues-emotional-labor/).   \n\n* Part of making someone feel heard is the emotional labor (the above and beyond and doing things with a good attitude, etc.).  Unless you have been doing this kind of work (i.e. a bartender, waiter, etc.) you may not understand the labor part of it.  And this can fall under \"other duties as assigned.\" \n\n* \"You have to be willing to help people and take care of them in IT.  That's what I have always strived to do.\" - Bill Kindle \n\n## 25:44 - Starting Small in IT \n\n* Working for the vocational school was the only job from which Bill was fired. \n\n* There were some things Bill needed to fix that he wasn't told about until the day he was let go. \n\n* This was his first IT job, and he was pretty devastated after being fired (felt like a failure). \n\n* Bill's future wife issued an ultimatum, saying he needed to get a job if she was going to stick around. \n\n* Bill had flirted around working for the railroad, signing up for a conductor course with a class 1 railroad. \n\n* About 30 minutes after getting a call about an opportunity to have an all expenses paid trip to conductor training, he received a call from a local IT shop wanting him to come in for an interview. \n\n* Someone got Bill's name from a former director at ITT whose son liked to recommend recent graduates to this particular IT shop (a small MSP, or Managed Service Provider).   \n\n* Bill went in for the interview and was hired on the spot.  There was a lot of commuting involved to get to work, so he decided to move closer to his work. \n\n* The work was interesting, and Bill was there about 3 years, feeling it was his first real IT job and starting as a bench technician working on repairing various computers. \n\n* Working for a MSP is like drinking from a fire hose and an opportunity to learn a great deal. \n\n* Bill progressed to network technician after about a month, working with CAT5 cabling, patch panels, etc. He learned about digital surveillance systems, how to do physical security, etc. \n\n* Bill liked MSP life and even thought about opening his own location closer to home, wanting to get more involved in the business.  The owners said no because it wasn't financially feasible at the time (housing market around this time was becoming a bit unstable). \n\n* Bill decided to begin looking for something else and got a job working for Goodwill Easter Seals, which to this day might be the best job Bill has ever had. \n\n* John makes the observation that Bill wanted advancement in this case too (transitioned to network engineer), and when further advancement was not something that could happen (i.e. opening his own branch / making more money), he had no choice but to move on. \n\n## 31:03 - Goodwill \n\n* Bill realized he was not going to be able to advance or make more money at the MSP and started looking around for alternate options. \n\n* Bill applied for an IT Support Engineer job at a local Goodwill and was hired on the spot after a conversation at a coffee shop. \n\n* This was one of the best moves Bill feels he has ever made and where he started really maturing as an adult.  \n\n* It irks Bill to this day when he comes across people with poor work ethic, especially after seeing someone who struggles with severe health issues be thankful that they are able to do simple things like hang clothes up each day. \n\n* Bill cherishes his time there and learned a lot but did not make a lot of money.   \n\n* He had not worked with nonprofits this deeply before this job (visiting a few churches when part of the MSP). \n\n* Bill learned to do IT on a shoestring budget thanks to this job, taking care of around 27 locations with point of sale devices at each. \n\n* He also learned a lot about the challenges non-profits have in getting funding. \n\n* Bill also helped get security cameras in all the stores, working with the loss prevention manager at the time to accomplish this and engaging his previous boss at the MSP to help with supplies for the project. \n\n## 34:33 - Spiceworks Community \n\n* Bill didn't learn about the [Spiceworks Community](https://community.spiceworks.com/) until he was working at Goodwill.  He would do basic Google searches for answers to questions, and Spiceworks kept coming up. \n\n* Bill started by shadowing some of the forums.  He was able to create his own solutions for people taking information from a number of posts (putting his own spin on things). \n\n* There was a lot of knowledge in the Spiceworks community to leverage, and it kept coming up time and time again. \n\n## 35:45 - Other Connections \n\n* When not troubleshooting network connections, Bill enjoyed making connections with people. \n\n* Bill felt like his work at Goodwill mattered much more so than for the previous to places he worked.  This is something he needs from a company (feeling like his work matters / is making an impact). \n\n* \"I have to feel like my work matters.  Because as soon as I don't feel like it matters, I just can't do it any more.\" - Bill Kindle \n\n* This remains one of Bill's top need from a job.  If the work matters, you do your best work. \n\n* For both financial and career reasons, Bill needed to move on. \n\n## 37:34 - Out of Nonprofit Space \n\n* Bill became the first full time employee for a small MSP.  They only had a few contracts with customers and struggled with contract employees. \n\n* Once again, Bill was hired on the spot. \n\n* Bill was to be bind of a manager but in title only from what he found. \n\n* Bill became self-sufficient and started using PowerShell a great deal (around the version 3.0 days).  There was a school that was a big client and had a lot of Active Directory user accounts to create and modify on tight timelines.  He had heard of PowerShell previous to this and decided to start using it. \n\n* People were using batch files and VBScript to accomplish some of the tasks already, and Bill was trying understand it well enough to rewrite it in PowerShell. \n\n* The people who made these scripts originally were so entrenched and set on using what they had created. \n\n* Bill would run his PowerShell script to make all of the same changes. \n\n## 40:28 - Bored and Recruited \n\n* This MSP was also not interested in business expansion much like the other one where he worked. \n\n* Nursing school for wife required health insurance, and Bill didn't have it. \n\n* A former friend from the Walmart days called Bill saying the company he was leaving desperately needed IT personnel. \n\n* He was once again hired on the spot (hasn't happened since). \n\n* This was Bill's first experience with multi-national company with main offices in the UK, but he worked in a small office in Cincinnati.   \n\n* It was a good job but was a bit boring.   \n\n* Bill could only do so much troubleshooting and had to work with development teams in the UK.  There was some downtime between support calls that he would spend in the Spiceworks community. \n\n* This was the first place bill had his own office. \n\n* It was a job with good benefits, good pay, and could have been done remotely.  Bill lobbied to work remotely but was denied. \n\n* Bill knew an IT manager in the UK was getting ready to retire, approached the owner, and asked to apply. \n\n* It turns out they had already hired a replacement around the time Bill spoke to the owner (which Bill learned later), and Bill felt he was lied to and that his work was not valued.  It was time to go. \n\n* At this point Bill's wanted to move closer to home. Bill came across a job for a multinational identity company out of Fort Wayne, Indiana. \n\n* Bill received a call from a recruiter, and it was one of the best recruiting calls he'd had. \n\n* Bill said he wanted his work to be valued and communicated that he was bored (doing more help desk work than he wanted). \n\n* Bill told the recruiter how much he was making and ended up getting a raise to move to the new company. \n\n* John says you need to know what you need.  Bill said he knew he wanted to be valued and respected.  People don't always have all those answers. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-181":{"title":"Episode 181","content":"\n# Episode 181\n\nWelcome to episode 181 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 2 of an interview with Bill Kindle, discussing Bill's experience in multiple technical communities, extracurricular writing activities, experience using PowerShell, and a conversation at a VMware User Group that brought him back from a career crisis. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 03-14-2022 \n\n[[Bill Kindle]] [Bill Kindle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billkindle/) is a Cybersecurity Engineer and has been in IT over 20 years, doing a little bit of everything over that time period.  If you missed it, catch part 1 of our interview with Bill in [Episode 180](https://nerd-journey.com/hired-on-the-spot-with-bill-kindle-1-3/). \n\nTopics – Community Participation and Leaving a Job, Blogging / Writing, Deciding What to Write, Scaling with PowerShell, Career Crisis and Burnout, A Local Community and A Step Back \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:03 - Community Participation and Leaving a Job \n\n* This is around the time when Bill got into #Spiceworks a lot, feeling he could help others while waiting for something to do.  He already had a habit of helping people. \n\n* The spice level is [somewhat gamified](https://community.spiceworks.com/points). \n\n* Nick explains point distributions and the distinction of the pure capsaicin level that Bill reached.  See [this Spiceworks article](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/998538-little-green-man-hits-pure-capsaicin) for the announcement (with Bill's username being [Little Green Man].(https://community.spiceworks.com/people/billkindle). \n\n* Bill was learning a lot and felt he was giving back to the community, feeding off of it for about 3 years.  He had so much to talk about. \n\n* It was sad leaving the last job with his own office. \n\n* Bill advises that we should make sure we read employment contracts.  If you don't like something, ask for an addendum, or don't sign it and go elsewhere. \n\n* John suggests looking for net positives for each party as you read through these types of agreements. \n\n## 7:27 - Blogging / Writing \n\n* Bill started dabbling in blogging at one point.  He tried a blogger page.   \n\n* Bill started following people on Twitter (many people who were doing PowerShell).   \n\n* He came across a post by [Adam the Automator](https://adamtheautomator.com/) about TechSnips (video recording and technical training). \n\n* Bill likes to teach people and started making videos (and doing voice overs) after a conversation with Adam.  \n\n* Look for a Pakt Publishing series on Server 2019.  Bill was contracted to do some voice over introductions for the courses.  They thought Bill had a good voice. \n\n* Bill end up doing some TechSnip courses that took a ton of prep. \n\n* He ended up scripting what he was going to say for some of these courses (not something he likes to do). \n\n* When Bill teaches he doesn't like to pre-plan too much, preferring to teach from his experience and not read an instruction manual to someone.  Blog posts are the same way. \n\n* His style is conversational. \n\n* John says you can take vocal coaching if you really want to pursue content creation heavily / professionally. \n\n* Bill learned little things like video editing, what goes into content creation, etc. \n\n* Bill and Adam had some great conversations, which allowed Bill to learn from Adam's experience. \n\n* Adam later started a [blog](https://adamtheautomator.com/), and Bill felt the blogging suited him better than video content creation (did not really have a quiet room). \n\n* For a while Bill would create 1-2 articles per month as one of the first few bloggers on this site (up until December 2021). \n\n* It started to get quite time consuming. \n\n* When writing, Bill likes to put in a specific set of points and then provide links to go deeper if people want. \n\n* Bill had other goals and needed to step back from writing, but he does maintain a Substack that allows him to write the things he wants to write (all kinds of topics). \n\n* Will Bill publish an article about how to make char cloth? \n\n* Bill learned through this that he enjoys writing and even at one point did a post for 4SysOps (in the style he truly enjoys) - [https://4sysops.com/archives/pushing-and-popping-navigating-in-powershell-with-push-location-and-pop-location/](https://4sysops.com/archives/pushing-and-popping-navigating-in-powershell-with-push-location-and-pop-location/) \n\n* Bill came up with the analogy in the shower one day and found the article writing very easy. \n\n* Bill loves to tell stories when teaching people (much like Don Jones advises in his writing seminars). \n\n## 17:28 - Deciding What to Write \n\n* At first, PowerShell was easy to target for articles (loved talking about it).  Bill also loves Linux. \n\n* Just write something.  It doesn't have to be super in depth.  It is a matter of getting content out there. \n\n* Don't think your experience is not valuable to someone.  You are sharing your experience and not that of others.  Don’t worry about other people's experience.   \n\n*  Bill had it in his mind that he didn't have anything to share despite his work in the Spiceworks community.  It was different when he got paid for an article.  He had never been paid for writing articles and had not really written articles for fun either. \n\n* When working on the Adam the Automator blog, Bill started to realize he enjoyed it. \n\n* You have to keep the repetition up.  Find something to write about and just do it, even if it isn't published to the web. \n\n* Bill keeps an A5 size [dot journal](https://www.sweetplanit.com/home/what-is-a-dot-grid-journal).  You can make it what you want (draw a grid for a to-do list). \n\n* You get a good feeling when you are physically writing on paper.  After typing all day long Bill does not want to stare at a screen.  He will open up his journal and just write to get a thought out (could be anything - idea for a blog, something his kids did, etc.). \n\n* \"If writing a book, write the book for you.  Get your knowledge out there, and let it be.  If it just helps one person, you've succeeded.\" - Bill Kindle (heard someone say this) \n\n* Bill has a mentee who keeps asking him how to gain experience in IT. \n\n* A good way is to start showing value.  Start a GitHub account, and put some code up there, even if something you are learning.  Then start writing about it. \n\n* Someone will eventually come across what you have shared and can use it or may share it with someone else. \n\n* Bill keeps telling himself that he is not writing for clicks.  He writes because he likes to share information.  Someone somewhere is going to get value from it. \n\n* With blogging, you talk about experiences.  People need to hear the experiences of others. \n\n## 23:41 - Scaling with PowerShell \n\n* Bill worked for the multi-national identity company.  It got him more interested in doing security due to the nature of the company. \n\n* Bill had dabbled in security here and there, but it never became his primary focus or primary responsibility. \n\n* He became a backup systems administrator and could work from home most of the time. \n\n* Bill learned about the change control board process at this company. \n\n* John makes an interesting comment about change control processes that seem a bit illogical. \n\n* People may not always know why change control processes are the way they are.  Maybe it should also be documented better. \n\n* Initially Bill was going to be a NOC (network operations center) manager (in name at least).  As time went on he was more of a systems administrator with hands in a lot of areas who could step into being backup for many others (acting as a first escalation point). \n\n* This is another role Bill considers as an experience in drinking from the fire hose. \n\n* Weekends were for Windows updates, with Bill working that schedule for about 5 years.   \n\n* Bill planned his schedule accordingly, but there was a lot of waiting involved.   \n\n* Bill felt like he could script a lot of the work did a lot of PowerShell scripting with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) after having grasps of policies and procedures. \n\n* He created a monster script after creating a script for each task in a modular way and running each command manually. \n\n* Bill talks about [Pester](https://pester.dev/) and how after learning from Adam Bertram's book ([The Pester Book](https://www.amazon.com/Pester-Book-All-One-Understanding-ebook/dp/B0861CB3Q5)) he used it to compliment his work (spot check automated reports, etc.). \n\n* Bill used Pester scripts to help with testing also.  He figured out a way to create HTML reports that were e-mailed to him.  He would go back and spot check to ensure the reports were not lying to him.  In the cases when they were he made modifications to the script accordingly. \n\n* The script ran flawlessly for years. \n\n* In the last few iterations of the script Bill did some additional fine tuning (ingest KB articles from a text file, easily re-use with other customers, etc.).   \n\n* Bill says this scripting project (largest amount of things he has automated) is discussed in the [PowerShell conference book series](https://leanpub.com/psconfbook3) to which he was a contributor. \n\n* This job paid for Bill to get his bachelor's degree (which he is very proud of), and scripting so many things afforded him the time to pursue it.  Bill was met with hesitancy over just an associate's degree early in his career. \n\n* Bill eventually got bored with the job.  \n\n## 32:24 - Career Crisis and Burnout \n\n* Bill had some career crisis moments.  He started to second guess IT in general and started to burn out.  It is real, and it happened to him around the time he started doing his bachelor's degree. \n\n* Bill didn't feel like he could move up, feeling there was so much more he could do than Windows Updates.  He wanted to try out for other roles within the company but was not really given a chance. \n\n* It started to wear on him, and he got pretty bummed out.  The job became more stressful, and he felt like his work quality was not there.   \n\n* He did not feel like he could do his best work or that his work mattered. \n\n* Bill went to the VMware User Group (VMUG) in Indianapolis at one point and loved it.  Every time he could go it rejuvenated him, especially after meeting some people. \n\n* Bill met John and Kat Troyer at one point at the VMUG and went to one of their career sessions, talking to them 1-1 after it. \n\n* Bill shared his struggles with them.  The most profound thing they said was \"it's not your fault that they are not utilizing your skills.\"  That was an a-ha moment for Bill, feeling a huge relief and like a giant weight had been lifted.   \n\n* He had to keep repeating this idea that it wasn't his fault to really allow it to sink in. \n\n* They also suggested Bill pursue some other outlets.  Not long after this Bill started making videos and writing as previously mentioned. \n\n* Bill found a renewed sense of purpose, like he was learning again, feeling like he did when he first got into IT.   \n\n* Bill was eager to learn, eager to share, and he didn’t care if his day job was not utilizing his skills. \n\n* At this point a number of opportunities opened up. \n\n* Bill trimmed back his involvement on Spiceworks (not getting as much out of it as before) and found other communities in which to be involved.  He started writing as well. \n\n* If that conversation had not have happened, Bill does not believe he would be in IT today.  The stress level was high, and the environment was somewhat toxic.   \n\n* Bill got his bachelors, got certifications, made a plan, gave it a couple years, and decided to go elsewhere. \n\n## 38:52 - A Local Community and A Step Back \n\n* Bill's next opportunity came from joining the local [Fort Wayne VMUG](https://mobile.twitter.com/fortwaynevmug). \n\n* Bill found purpose again with that group.  One of the leaders lives close to Bill, and he enjoyed making new friends. \n\n* The leaders talked Bill into doing some presentations, and he really enjoyed it.   \n\n* There is a misconception that VMUG talks about only VMware products.  Bill shares some additional talk subjects (PowerShell, etc.). \n\n* His renewed purpose came from getting out there and trying to share more. \n\n* John says Bill pieced together his needs.  Since all could not be met in the job, Bill added extra things to help meet his needs. \n\n* Bill also used [Kanban](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban) to visualize his work.   \n\n* He began to understand just how much work he was doing with the PowerShell scripts he made.  He was doing 30 maintenance cycles per month. \n\n* Bill also mentions [Time Management for Systems Administrators](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Management-System-Administrators-Working/dp/0596007833) by Tom Limoncelli. \n\n* Nick mentions [Why Smart Kids Worry](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Smart-Kids-Worry-Parents/dp/140228425X) and the need to show how far you have come. \n\n* Kanban can help you visualize your wins, even if you use post it notes. \n\n* Bill created his own schedule and made it bearable to stick with the job he was in, allowing more time to correct.  Bill says when he first started there was a merger that hit. \n\n* Bill got back to concentrating on himself.  He got really good at time management. He was writing. He started to volunteer to edit and contribute to PowerShell conference books, having his name on a couple of them. \n\n* Bill would have never thought back in 2017 at that VMUG that he would have his name on a book.  They were the right people at the right time. \n\n* John mentions when we keep getting blocked from progression we tend to internalize it (thinking we may not be good enough). \n\n* Beware of hearing your position is really hard to backfill. \n\n* Episodes and other items mentioned in the outro: \n\n* [Episode 127](https://nerd-journey.com/countdown-to-burnout-with-tom-hollingsworth-3-3/) - Countdown to Burnout with [[Tom Hollingsworth]] [[Episode 127]] \n\n* [Episode 132](https://nerd-journey.com/riding-the-burnout-wave-with-jonathan-frappier-2-2/) - Riding the Burnout Wave with [[Jonathan Frappier]] [[Episode 132]]\n\n* [Episode 179](https://nerd-journey.com/make-it-known-slow-things-down-dont-burn-out/) - Nick's struggle with burnout [[Episode 179]]\n\n* [Chasing Excellence by Ben Bergeron](https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Excellence-Building-Fittest-Athletes/dp/1619617285) [[Chasing Excellence]] [[Ben Bergeron]]\n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-182":{"title":"Episode 182","content":"\n# Episode 182\n\nWelcome to episode 182 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

A New Adventure Awaits \n\n* Bill did some presentation work for a local #VMUG (VMware User Group) in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  This allowed Bill to meet many people in the industry. \n\n* One person whom Bill considers a friend told him about an opportunity in cybersecurity engineering and asked that Bill try out for the role. \n\n* Bill was able to meet with his friend and the COO (Chief Operating Officer) for this new company, and he was essentially hired on the spot. \n\n* Bill had an interest in security and knew his way around some tools already. \n\n* The job was supporting a SOC (security operations center) team.  They wanted someone with a systems administrator background who knew how to deploy security tooling. \n\n* At this juncture, Bill was really looking to do something different, feeling like he was at a bit of a peak in his previous role. \n\n* Doing writing and presenting on the side was helping, but Bill felt like he needed to break into a different role / try something different, wanting to put his full effort into it. \n\n* Previous to this Bill had an interest in security but was more an observer of the industry than an active participant. \n\n* Bill would implement security into his daily work (as systems administrators should) but tried to take a more holistic approach.  He was doing some of this kind of work already. \n\n* The new role allowed him to flex his systems administration skills and gave him a whole new set of skills on top of those.  Bill was able to leverage PowerShell as well as get exposure to a whole new set of tools including some in the realm of configuration management. \n\n* John mentioned the generalist approach is a good way to enter into something new, and once you enter a more specialized field you begin to understand perhaps you only had a fraction of what people working in that field as specialists have in terms of skills and knowledge. \n\n* Bill said there were many things he didn't know / have insight into that were fascinating.   \n\n* At some point Bill realized he was seeing things through the eyes of a security analyst and what was needed to do their job.  Once he understood that perspective, he knew where and how to best help (i.e. deploy a logging platform, help deploy endpoint detection and response technologies in a more efficient manner, etc.). \n\n## 7:38 - A Different Lens \n\n* Bill was able to build on a lot of the skills he had and really understand the why and the value of the security tooling to those who operated it daily to hunt threats and perform other work. \n\n* Bill, from a systems administrator perspective, got to see the holes identified by the security analysts and would work with them to explain how to fix the holes, work around them, etc.  It was eye opening to see how these folks operated. \n\n* John says there's something to that firsthand understanding of someone else's operational tempo and daily work that better equips us to show empathy and sympathy.  This may make a good case for organizations to apply rotations in different departments. \n\n* Someone who then rotates back into their former position has a way better understanding of what they should be doing. \n\n* Bill got to see why having a systems engineer turned cybersecurity engineer assist the SOC analysts was necessary.  The typical SOC analyst may not have the deep systems knowledge and will have to make certain assumptions, so having a person with the systems background work alongside them is very helpful.   \n\n* In Bill's experience no two roles are going to be identical when it comes to cybersecurity engineering. \n\n* Some of the people he has spoken with about cybersecurity engineering were surprised to hear that so much systems administration knowledge was applicable despite the cybersecurity focus. \n\n* There was a misconception that most cybersecurity engineers were [purple teamers](https://danielmiessler.com/study/red-blue-purple-teams/) or red teamers.  Bill shared that he doesn't do hacking. \n\n* Bill did engineering work for the SOC to make stuff work properly so security investigations were successful. \n\n* John classifies this as operating and supporting the platforms upon which the security tools are being used. \n\n* Bill found excitement in the role, feeling he was \"in the thick of it\" each day.  He needed a deep understanding of how everything worked together to provide a service to his clients (members of the SOC team). \n\n* When things didn't work it meant teams could not do their jobs.  Bill took great pride in ensuring things were working as needed to support this. \n\n* Bill has found the role both fun and very enlightening in the last couple of years. \n\n* Listen to John's analogy about a heavy machine mechanic who works on diesel trucks vs. someone who specializes in this for fire trucks and adjusting knowledge for the operational needs of a specific platform. \n\n* Bill says when you see a fire truck, there's so much more to it than a big truck that shoots water.  Many components work together so the fire truck operates efficiently, and every person has a job on the fire truck. \n\n* Sometimes you have a person who understands every aspect of the fire truck and how it works, which is similar to the role Bill worked as a cybersecurity engineer (know how the tools work together, how to tune them to work together better, spot when they are ineffective and need to be swapped out for something else, etc.). \n\n* Nick classifies this role as a security systems architect. \n\n* Bill says one of his co-workers had this title and was in charge of making multiple security platforms work together through back end automation. \n\n## 14:22 - Advice for Breaking into the Cybersecurity Field \n\n* Don't be afraid of writing about your experiences. \n\n* Build a home lab.  You can do it with an old laptop and a cheap network switch.  There is also the option to do labs online. \n\n* Start somewhere.  You need to have some activity.  Just waiting for a role to come up is not the best way to break into cybersecurity. \n\n* Put yourself out there, and if you have local communities in the area like a [BSides group](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194138/BSides). \n\n* Bsides is like a community security conference.  Some of the groups have monthly meetings. \n\n* Security professionals from SOC analysts to C-level executives attend these events. \n\n* Topics like education, career advice, and general security trends and best practices are usually part of the agenda for these events. \n\n* Bill's first involvement in one of these happened in 2022.  He joined a local group in Fort Wayne, Indiana with some former co-workers who were SOC analysts. \n\n* There were a couple hundred people who attended with several vendors as well.  The presentations were very good.  Bill classifies the event as phenomenal.   \n\n* It was good to see people in person again.  Hearing the stories from people in different job roles and what they are doing was exciting.   \n\n* The discussions ranged from job responsibilities for those in the industry to threats attendees were seeing in their own environments and how to thwart them. \n\n* Good conversations and becoming active in the community is what it is all about.  If these groups exist in your area, check them out! \n\n* Don't skimp on the fundamentals like how networks and operating systems work. \n\n* Building blocks like these make up the foundation of what you will need to know to be effective as a cybersecurity engineer, analyst, or architect. \n\n* Bill has seen a number of people go through boot camps, and they are not as effective as they could have been if they had not skimped on fundamentals in the beginning. \n\n* John shares a story about someone who says they want to be in animation but who doesn't have any work to show a potential boss (i.e. proof of work and experience like writing about work done in a home lab might get you). \n\n* Bill mentions [Mike Judge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Judge) getting his start by going to animation conferences and eventually making some iconic shows. \n\n* Bill mentions [Black Hills Information Security](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/) as a great resource for training (called [Antisyphon training](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/)). \n\n* Check out other sites like [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/) or [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) for resources and further community involvement options. \n\n## 19:52 - Certifications and Proof of Work \n\n* After being able to sit in on a few interviews, it impressed Bill more when he met people doing things on their own like mentioned above than someone who walked in with a [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP). \n\n* The industry sometimes puts too much value on certifications as opposed to demonstrated skills. \n\n* The CISSP does require documented experience but may not automatically make you as effective at your job as doing some of the hands on activities which demonstrate you are doing the work you're trying to break into for a job. \n\n* If you're building a resume / history of experience that you've written about and a deep understanding of the fundamentals to go with it, someone is more likely to take a chance on you in the cybersecurity space than someone who has the certification but none of the experience and documented write ups.   \n\n* An employer may say they want you to pursue the certification and even pay for it after showing what you're working toward in your writing. \n\n* The writing is the proof that you can and have learned. \n\n* Bill says SOC analysts have to be able to tell stories with data and articulate what it is you are seeing, what it is you are seeing, why it is bad, actions needed, etc. \n\n* If you are doing this with a home lab, it makes the job that much easier. \n\n* You will know the basics of what you're looking for, how to articulate the basics, and be better prepared to success. \n\n* Going to get a [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/home) certification on its own may not make you as ready for the role.   \n\n* It isn't just responding to threats all the time.  There is reporting to be done and analysis that goes with it.  There is data analysis, log analysis, and articulating what you see to others (management, other teams, teammates, etc.). \n\n* Even if you just write a couple paragraphs about something you're doing in your home lab, do it.  Who cares if no one else reads it.  Having the evidence of what you're doing for a hiring manager to see is going to be more impressive than just listing a bunch of certifications. \n\n* Having a certification does not mean you are competent. \n\n* Writing samples are things you hardly ever get in a job interview or during the hiring process. \n\n* If someone is delivering the way they think and communicate in the form of good writing, it seems like this would give the person a leg up at some point in the hiring process. \n\n## 24:38 - Repetition and Taking Chances \n\n* Bill does not claim to be a professional writer and doesn't intend to be.  But if he has something to share he will do a write up.  We all need to get the repetition in. \n\n* Bill shares an instance where someone recently reached out to thank him for writing something 2 years ago that solved their problem.   \n\n* He put the article out there to share knowledge and to list on a resume.  Bill did it for himself first, and everything else is secondary. \n\n* Nick references [The Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Shipping-Creative-Work/dp/0593328973) by Seth Godin and the idea of shipping creative work to be generous and create positive change in the world. \n\n* Nick shares this quote from [Still Alright: A Memoir](https://www.amazon.com/Still-Alright-Memoir-Kenny-Loggins/dp/0306925362) by Kenny Loggins: \n\n* \"Follow the fun.  If you love what you're doing you're going to get good at it. If you're good at it, someone is going to hire you. Get great at it, and someone might pay you a bunch of money to do it.  As long as you love it, you will be happy.\" \n\n* Nick sees this pattern happening with Bill, a continual following of the things he really enjoys (especially since the discussion with the Troyers at a VMUG). \n\n* Bill owes a lot of gratitude to that conversation. \n\n* You have to learn to take chances.  Sometimes you get stuck in a rut and just need to make a move. \n\n* Bill mentions [Jocko Willink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocko_Willink) and the advice to stop, look around, make a call, execute on it, and repeat.   \n\n* This is a good descriptor of Bill's move into cybersecurity - deciding to do something uncomfortable that it turns out he really enjoyed. \n\n* It's easy to get paralyzed by analysis and fear that you're making the wrong decision or that there's no way back. \n\n* You can decide to go in a direction and reflect back (in your own \"write up\" of the situation) and realize you need to change slightly in your next move (what you decide to do next). \n\n* You have to iterate, just like DevOps - get through a cycle, evaluate, make adjustments, and keep going. \n\n* Should the podcast subtitle be \"just iterate?\"  If you can tell us the one episode with the word iterate in the title, DM us on Twitter to get stickers! \n\n## 28:42 - Parting Thoughts \n\n* If you have questions for Bill, find him on [LinkedIn]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/billkindle/]()). \n\n* You can find some of his writing on [Adam the Automator's website](https://adamtheautomator.com/) or on [4sysops](https://4sysops.com/).  Bill should have new content in these areas coming soon! \n\n* Bill says you cannot burn yourself out doing what you love.  He pulled back his writing, but the bug recently hit him again. \n\n* John makes the distinction between writing for your own blog and for a professional site.  If you get good enough at writing you could make extra money. \n\n* \"There are benefits to writing.  You just have to start doing it.\" - Bill Kindle \n\n* As of this recording Bill is also collaborating on another book.  Stay tuned for updates from him! \n\n* References from the outro \n\n* For more on the path to a cybersecurity career, check out [Episode 133](https://nerd-journey.com/forensics-and-the-boredom-of-peacetime-with-donovan-farrow-1-2/) and [Episode 134](https://nerd-journey.com/pass-down-your-legacy-with-donovan-farrow-2-2/) with [[Donovan Farrow]] [[Episode 133]] [[Episode 134]]  \n\n* [[Writing is Thinking]] - good advice from [[Josh Duffney]] in [Episode 156](https://nerd-journey.com/better-notes-better-you-with-josh-duffney-1-2/)  [[Episode 156]]\n\n* All this talk of writing makes both John and Nick want to write more often \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-183":{"title":"Episode 183","content":"\n# Episode 183\n\nWelcome to episode 183 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we share part 1 of an interview with Michael Levan, discussing his background in fitness, deep work, focus, nutrition, and how we can all learn to build habits incrementally. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-15-2022 \n\nTopics – Meet [[Michael Levan]], Fitness of the Body and Mind, Iterative Approach to Deep Work, Building Habits Takes Practice, Finding Focus Amidst Distraction, Benefits of Fasting \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:40 - Meet Michael Levan \n\n* [Michael Levan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellevan/) focuses in the cloud native applications space, focusing on Kubernetes and containers.  Most of what he does right now focuses orchestrating these types of environments. \n\n* Michael works to create practical technical, educational content and acts as a consultant for customers. \n\n* And remember to check out Michael's podcast, [Kubernetes Unpacked](https://packetpushers.net/?s=kubernetes+unpacked) on Packet Pushers. \n\n* Find Michael on Twitter ([@TheNJDevOpsGuy](https://twitter.com/TheNJDevOpsGuy)).  \n\n## 5:33 - Fitness of the Body and Mind \n\n* Before getting into technology, Michael was a personal trainer and went to school for it.  He loved fitness and was into powerlifting when he was younger. \n\n* Other guests with a fitness background who have been on the show are (but neither went into technology): \n\n* [[Randall Cook]] - [Episode 101](https://nerd-journey.com/big-career-changes-and-reluctant-entrepreneurship-with-randall-cook/) and [Episode 102](https://nerd-journey.com/food-life-and-work-with-randall-cook/) [[Episode 101]] [[Episode 102]]\n\n* [[Blake Johnson]] - [Episode 135](https://nerd-journey.com/fit-to-be-changed-with-blake-johnson-1-2/) and [Episode 136](https://nerd-journey.com/no-comfort-in-the-growth-zone-with-blake-johnson-2-2/) [[Episode 135]] [[Episode 136]] \n\n* After getting out of school, Michael realized he was more interested in doing personal training as it relates to bodybuilding than what personal training in general was at the time (helping people who might not be very fit gain mobility / get out of bed in the morning, etc.). \n\n* Today Michael works out 5 days per week. \n\n* Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday are primarily for [push-pull](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/push-pull-workout) style workouts. \n\n* Wednesday is primarily for cardio work. \n\n* Sometimes he will do more bodybuilding style workouts, but for now he is sticking mostly to push-pull. \n\n* Michael receives benefits from working out like: \n\n* Reducing stress \n\n* Mental clarity gained after a workout / increased focus \n\n* Bodybuilding style workouts that involve pushing yourself not only push you physically but also mentally.  In a way, this takes your mind to the next level. \n\n* What you put into your body will determine how you feel later.  Michael encourages people to try an experiment in eating clean for 2-3 weeks and then go back to eating the way they were.   \n\n* You will feel a noticeable difference. \n\n* There is a combination of how you feel mentally and physically and what you put into your body. \n\n* Michael does not consider himself a health nut. \n\n* Michael is a big fan of meal prep.  He likes to eat the same thing each day for lunch meals. \n\n* An example meal for Michael = whole wheat wrap with BBQ chicken and cheddar cheese inside \n\n* Instead of chips he will use whole wheat Cheez-Its (for a nice something crunchy). \n\n* Dinner is a bit of a variety of things depending on Michael's schedule - grilled steak / hamburger, turkey sandwich on whole wheat with cheese maybe with some Cheez-Its \n\n* Eating clean is… \n\n* Think about what goes into your body. \n\n* Reduce heavy carbohydrates and fast food. \n\n* Keep sodium intake low as it may lead to fatigue. \n\n* Focus on high quality proteins like grilled chicken, steak, turkey breast / turkey meat from the deli (without the preservatives). \n\n* Just being conscious of what you are putting into your body will make a big difference from a mental standpoint. \n\n* John was once a pretty serious road cyclist, finding that one could eat just about as many calories as desired with the ability to still burn through them all due to activity level. \n\n* However, you start to be tuned into the feedback cycle based on the food you eat.  Poor food choices make you feel worse while trying to do cycling (i.e. going the same distance might be significantly harder), and this can bleed over into every day life (encouraging cyclists to eat healthier / cleaner). \n\n* If Michael eats poorly one day, he does not feel well the next day and is notably at less than peak performance (something feels off). \n\n* Similarly, Michael does not drink alcohol during the week because he knows that he will feel like garbage the next day. \n\n* There is a certain way to live to get that peak performance, and this can be very rewarding. \n\n* If you don't feel off each day due to poor diet it may be because your diet is consistently poor. \n\n* You don't realize how badly you feel without having a good peak to compare the two. \n\n* It's easy to notice something is off when you're at the top of a hill and can go in any direction. \n\n* John describes the \"meh\" feeling that makes it easy to sit and scroll on a device for hours. \n\n* Michael says sadly this feeling describes 90% of the population.  This is the normal feeling. \n\n* Once you introduce a change into the daily routine / constant feeling, you can clearly see when you're off. \n\n* Michael has times when he realizes he's spent too much time on a device.  He's human like all of us and doesn't always change the situation, but he does recognize something is off, knowing it needs to change. \n\n## 13:36 - Iterative Approach to Deep Work \n\n* What is the iterative, modular approach to refactoring one's lifestyle so the changes are not quite as extreme? \n\n* We need to realize the \"normal\" way of doing things is not the right way of doing things. \n\n* For example, scrolling on your phone for 6 hours a day on social media / getting sucked into doing that is not normal. \n\n* Michael thought for a long time he was the crazy one for wanting to focus.  As he progressed in his career he later realized the crazy was on everyone else for not taking time to focus on highly valuable activities. \n\n* We need to learn to incorporate some type of deep work into our routines. \n\n* We should seek to practice deep work, understand what it is, and seek to understand what true focus is. \n\n* See also our [[Deep Work]] series starting with [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/) and ending with [Episode 147](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-7-become-hard-to-reach/). [[Episode 141]]  [[Episode 147]] [[Cal Newport]] \n\n* Michael recommends listeners read… \n\n* [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B0189PVAWY) by [[Cal Newport]] \n\n* [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by [[James Clear]] [[Atomic Habits]] \n\n* [Stolen Focus](https://www.amazon.com/Stolen-Focus-Attention-Think-Deeply/dp/0593138511) by [[Johann Hari]] [[Stolen Focus]]\n\n* Michael is re-reading this one during the time of this recording. \n\n* Read the books, but understand you will not be at each author's level when you start trying to do deep work. \n\n* Michael likes Cal Newport very much, but Newport is an academic researcher and makes some assumptions as a result.  But suggestions like staying off social media, getting time away from your phone, etc. are extremely important. \n\n* Another great read is [The Practicing Mind](https://www.amazon.com/The-Practicing-Mind-audiobook/dp/B004C5K266/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8\u0026qid=\u0026sr=) by [[Thomas M. Sterner]]. [[The Practicing Mind]] \n\n* This book is centered around staying in the present.  What is the last time you drove in your car with no music or any other form of media turned on? \n\n* The techniques / ideas discussed in these books takes practice.  Michael is still practicing and probably will be for the rest of his life. \n\n* You may read the books and think to yourself \"that's not realistic for me\" based on your job function, demands, or other environmental factors. \n\n* Michael agrees the books do not address certain realities. \n\n* For example, Michael is a single guy and goes on dates.  He cannot close himself off from the world.   \n\n* The authors of some of the books suggest focusing on career, certain friends, and their families. \n\n* Some of the advice may need to be tempered based on where you are in life. \n\n* We need to take in information and understand the context in which it was written. \n\n* Cal Newport, for example, is a high performing academic.  Some of the recommendations have to be generalized and may not be exactly applicable to your type of work. \n\n* In order to get paid well, we will have to do hard things.  If we are doing hard things, it will generally require a great deal of intense focus / concentration.  This will necessitate the ability to overcome distractions. \n\n* This reminds John of what Michael mentioned regarding the ability to work out and strengthen the mental fortitude which allows you to push through barriers in other areas. \n\n## 20:48 - Building Habits Takes Practice \n\n* As discussed, this takes practice. \n\n* Michael says there are days when his mind is so strained that he will, without even thinking, login to Twitter.  Usually he will catch it, stop himself, and close out of it.  It's a defense mechanism. \n\n* Michael is very into cognitive science and psychology. \n\n* Our bodies and brains are set to save as much energy as possible.  When you're in deep work you're using a lot of energy.  Our bodies naturally want us to stop. \n\n* \"The working out, the eating certain things, the staying focused, the deep work…that's the key to success.\" - Michael Levan \n\n* People ask Michael often how he is able to accomplish what he does without burnout and how he is able to focus on so many things. \n\n* That's the formula that enables Michael to do what he does. \n\n* Take adding in deep work to your schedule in increments (a lesson from James Clear's book mentioned previously). \n\n* The biggest mistake people make is going all in from the beginning. Michael gives the example of someone signing up for the gym going several hours per day for a few weeks and never going back (due to the mere fact that the person did not build a habit). \n\n* You can build a habit for anything.  Michael gives the example of turning on a light switch when we enter a dark room being something we do without thinking.  We can make any habit like this. \n\n* Back to the gym example…a more successful approach would be to go to the gym a couple of times per week for 15 minutes.  Do that for a couple of weeks, and then go to 3 days a week.  Then extend the time a little bit maybe to 25 minutes.  Build from there. \n\n* With deep work, you won't be able to do 3 hours of it at a time starting out.  But you could try it for 15 minutes for a few weeks, then 20 minutes, then 30.  Eventually you might be able to do 3 hours of deep work per day without really giving it much thought (i.e. just something you do). \n\n* NOTE: This is also a way to build up bad habits. \n\n* For any habit we need to start in small increments.  This goes back to the fact that our brains are designed to conserve energy. \n\n* The things that take cognitive and physical load off our bodies (sitting, staring at a screen) are easy to continue doing. \n\n* Getting more activity, concentrating on a really hard problem, and other activities can be tough because the inertia is in the opposite direction. \n\n* John likes the combination of fitness, deep work, and Atomic Habits. \n\n## 26:21 - Finding Focus Amidst Distraction \n\n* We have to force and train ourselves to focus for 10 minutes (not the case many years ago).  We have been trained to pick up a device for entertainment, to get food or other package deliveries quickly, etc.  The instant gratification is messing us (as humans) up. \n\n* Go look at Stanford or Harvard research studies in these areas for further reading. \n\n* Go search for [social media is hacking your brain](https://www.google.com/search?q=social+media+is+hacking+your+brain\u0026oq=social+media+is+hacking+your+brain).  Companies are designing their products to make them addictive. \n\n* See also [The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/).  We're not equipped to beat the algorithms on social media. \n\n* When we do a Google search for something, we start to see what we wanted in different places.  Google is building a profile on us by design. \n\n* Michael says our brains have not evolved in 5000 years (since the cave man era).  We've learned and adapted, but things like the way our right frontal cortex works and how neurons fire are no different. \n\n* Our brains are not meant for so much information coming at us. \n\n* Walking outside your house and noticing the trees, birds, and surrounding area is about how much information our brains are meant to take in. \n\n* Once you open up an app like Twitter and swipe, swipe, swipe you have consumed an immense amount of information all at once and after a while start to feel differently (not in a good way). \n\n* Many advances in technology make it even harder to focus than it is now. \n\n* Michael is concerned for his 5-year-old son and what will happen as he grows up but has set boundaries for screen use and tries to help his son learn to improve focus. \n\n* Many believed television would rot our brains when it was released.  John makes the point that what we have now isn't the same. \n\n* When cartoons started being shown on television they could be watched after school and on Saturday mornings.  \n\n* This schedule is no longer a barrier for people.  Instant gratification can be taken advantage of 24 hours per day every day of the week. \n\n* More content is being uploaded than any human can consume. \n\n* Having a site like YouTube open is not the bad thing for our minds by itself.  It's the context switching between platforms, instant gratification, and multitasking. \n\n* John was watching a YouTube video about building an application on top of Graph databases.  It was hard to follow unless you were really paying attention.  Even pausing the video to switch over to his own environment to tinker and then come back was a little much.  He had to watch the video, try to internalize it and process it, and then come back to trying to put it into practice. \n\n* Deep work is possible using YouTube, Twitter, or some of these other platforms.  But these tools can easily deliver content that acts to distract us. \n\n## 33:06 - Benefits of Fasting \n\n* Michael had back surgery just over 2 years ago, and his recovery time was 6-7 months.  He could do very little during this time, gained a lot of weight and did not feel great. \n\n* Michael started going to the gym but wasn't seeing results or weight loss like he was used to seeing before the surgery.  The combination of the surgery and getting older means the body and metabolism are changing. \n\n* At this point Michael started researching intermittent fasting as a way to lose water weight and still hit the gym like he did previously.  \n\n* Intermittent fasting helps with weight loss and also energy. \n\n* Once you pass a certain period of time without eating, your body starts metabolizing more energy.   \n\n* If you have a bagel for breakfast for example, you're taking in a large amount of carbs that will weigh you down for the day. \n\n* It is much easier for Michael to focus in the morning if he does not eat than if he does eat.   \n\n* Michael has been following an intermittent fasting regimen for about a year now.   \n\n* In some cases Michael will break this regimen for a day to take his son out for pancakes on a Saturday, for example, or while on vacation. \n\n* Typically Michael will stop eating around 7 or 8 PM and won't eat again until the next day around 11:30 AM or 12 PM. \n\n* Michael speaks to the [ketosis state](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-1-diabetes-guide/what-is-ketosis#1) a bit.  Our bodies use carbohydrates for energy.   \n\n* Ketosis allows the body to use fat for energy when carbs are limited. \n\n* Michael makes the comment that this process also burns through muscle tissue. \n\n* It's important to take in enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats as part of a diet. \n\n* For intermittent fasting specifically, you are not taking in for  16-18 hours, and your body is in a light starvation mode. \n\n* You can lose weight. \n\n* You can also gain a massive amount of energy. \n\n* To dig deeper on this topic, check out [The Complete Guide to Fasting](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Fasting-Intermittent-Alternate-Day/dp/1628600012) by Dr. Jason Fung and Jimmy Moore. \n\n* Michael compares this to being really busy all day, realizing you have not eaten but also that you have a lot of energy. \n\n* Michael admits he does not know the exact science here, but it may be worth researching for listeners! \n\n* Episodes mentioned in the outro: \n\n* See [Episode 127](https://nerd-journey.com/countdown-to-burnout-with-tom-hollingsworth-3-3/) with Tom Hollingsworth and the discussion on goal setting so you avoid burnout. \n\n* Check out the deep work series of episodes starting with [Episode 141](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/) and ending with [Episode 147](https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-7-become-hard-to-reach/). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-184":{"title":"Episode 184","content":"\n# Episode 184\n\nWelcome to episode 184 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 2 of an interview with Michael Levan , discussing Michael's career from systems administration to DevOps engineering to SRE to business owner.  Michael also shares some tips on learning and building skills. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-15-2022 \n\n- [[Michael Levan]] [Michael Levan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellevan/) focuses in the cloud native applications space, focusing on Kubernetes and containers.  Remember to check out Michael's podcast, [[Kubernetes Unpakced]] [Kubernetes Unpacked](https://packetpushers.net/?s=kubernetes+unpacked) on [[Packet Pushers]].  Find Michael on Twitter ([@TheNJDevOpsGuy](https://twitter.com/TheNJDevOpsGuy)), and catch part 1 of our interview with Michael in [[Episode 183]] [Episode 183](https://nerd-journey.com/practice-makes-habit-with-michael-levan-1-2/). \n\nTopics – On Titles and Focus Areas, Finding Your Pace, Dive Deep, Enjoy the Process, Reasons for Starting a Business, Finding Stability, Talent Cycles and Parting Thoughts  \n\n=========================== \n\n## 4:05 - On Titles and Focus Areas \n\n* Michael started his IT career as a systems administrator, working in #ActiveDirectory, Microsoft #Exchange, and #WindowsServer.   \n\n* He learned #PowerShell and began to focus more on automation technologies and techniques.   \n\n* Michael remembers writing his first PowerShell script to help get information on Hyper-V virtual machines. \n\n* In learning more about PowerShell, he learned more about Python.   \n\n* That led him into more of a #DevOps / #SRE (site reliability engineer) / cloud engineer type role.   \n\n* Michael feels it is easier to move from infrastructure to development than from development to infrastructure.  In development there is a ton of infrastructure and networking. \n\n* Michael has also held some software developer roles while working in the DevOps / SRE spaces and did consulting. \n\n* The consulting is something he continues today, primarily writing in #Go [Go](https://go.dev/) and #Python sometimes. \n\n* His career went from systems administration to starting to understand automation to combining both into the SRE / DevOps role and then doing different things in the orchestration and container space. \n\n* Michael doesn't care for titles.  If everyone could be called an engineer our lives would be better, but titles get aligned with pay scales.   \n\n* What about the difference in the SRE and the infrastructure engineer? \n\n* An infrastructure engineer worries about the overall architecture - where something is running and how the systems run. \n\n* The SRE is taking all of these things into account but also focusing on heavy observability and monitoring to make the architecture that is being deployed repeatable. \n\n* The SRE is more focused on the automation and repeatability of things, but Michael has not seen an infrastructure job in a while that didn't require some kind of configuration management / automation tooling like Terraform (or even a scripting programing language) as part of it.  \n\n* Michael does not see a big difference in a DevOps Engineer and a SRE these days.   \n\n* There is a difference between a build engineer (who focuses on [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/)) and SRE, but you don't see a lot of plain build engineers out there. \n\n* At the end of the day, there are people who focus on code, people who focus on infrastructure (wherever it may be), and then all of these people are focused on both at the same time (i.e. each one needing the other). \n\n* John points out a difference in speed of development cycles each of these different roles may support.  A traditional infrastructure engineer may support slower cycles than that of a DevOps Engineer or SRE.   \n\n* The availability requirements of each will be different.  Maybe a SRE / DevOps Engineer measures this in minutes per month as opposed to looking at longer maintenance windows. \n\n* Michael says there are roles within organizations that have not adapted new standards (healthcare, government, etc.) and operate more on the waterfall model (slower to make changes and not as frequent). \n\n## 10:55 - Finding Your Pace \n\n* Michael was at a government job for a while as a systems administrator but felt the pace was too slow.  \n\n* If you happen to be in one of these slower paced roles and want a faster pace, one suggestion is go to a startup and try it. \n\n* In the slower paced roles when people get laid off, trying to get into a fast paced job market can be quite challenging.  Nick suggests trying to incorporate some type of automation technologies into what you are doing even if in small steps. \n\n* While at the government job, Michael spent his time trying to automate things as much as he could.  The extra time he was allowed to learn gave him a chance to build skills for getting the next job. \n\n* John suggests the traditional developer's path is from a computer science degree or perhaps some coding boot camp.  The infrastructure engineer has a built in way to get closer to the development side of the house through what we used to call scripting. \n\n## 13:57 - Dive Deep \n\n* John has fumbled around playing with Python quite a bit and then heard about the idea of clean code (focusing on code readability), which became a little overwhelming. \n\n* He wondered if he was learning it the right way and had trouble seeing the iterative path for someone coming from an infrastructure background. \n\n* Michael says everything makes sense when you dive as deep as you possibly can into it. \n\n* If you take an hour to learn about Python and then try to dive in head first into more and more content it is probably not going to make a lot of sense.   \n\n* Michael suggests taking a free YouTube course (for example), and then go and apply the learnings.  Then go take another one and do some application of it (i.e. build a small app, a game, etc.) until you have learned the language basics. \n\n* Once you understand a language, many of them blend together. \n\n* Programming is giving a computer a blueprint to go and do a thing. \n\n* Once you fully understand a language, things like test-driven development, clean code, etc. are going to make sense.  \n\n* People tend to take a 1 hour course, dive in, get confused, and lose hope.  Take the time to go deep a little at a time until you can get into the more advanced topics. \n\n* Nick suggests this is encouraging people to go down the rabbit hole of learning, but how do we know when to come back out? \n\n* Michael says this is based on experience.  There are noteworthy differences between engineers at different levels. \n\n* A junior engineer is fixing bugs and trying to figure out what technology is in the first place. \n\n* A mid-level engineer may be working on a feature or two in the code. \n\n* A senior level engineer may be building an application. \n\n* A staff / principal level engineer is architecting the application. \n\n* Once you get to a certain experience level, played with different tech, worked on various platforms you can see when you might be getting off track and too deep. \n\n* For the junior and mid-level engineers, if you keep buying more and more courses and are not learning anything new, that is when you should realize you are ready for the next level. \n\n* Take the beginner / intermediate level courses from various sources.  Each will teach about the same things in different ways.  Then go to the next level when ready. \n\n* John says when he learns, the best way is by doing a project,  which drives him to keep going.   \n\n* There is a big jump from working on infrastructure things to maintaining a code base, for example. \n\n* Once you work on a project that motivates you, you want to do it right.  This can drive you into over analysis, a conflict of wanting to learn the language but build in the optimal way. \n\n* Until you have done things and realize at the end you didn't do it optimally or that you need to make a change, you won't learn it a subject at the level of depth that an experienced engineer has. \n\n* Michael would argue there isn't a right or wrong way to do something in the beginning. \n\n* Most of the developers Michael has worked with have their own set of processes, preferred standards, tooling for interactive development environments (IDEs), how they bring in packages, how they do versioning, etc. \n\n* It seems like there are far less bad practices than people think. \n\n## 23:11 - Enjoy the Process \n\n* When getting into something for the first time (like a programming language), enjoy the process. \n\n* We are so focused on getting to the end state, knowing it all, etc.  We don't enjoy the process. \n\n* \"Mess up.  Go a year messing things up…and learn from that process.  That's the only way to do it.  The only way to be truly great at something is to fail far more times than succeed.\" - Michael Levan \n\n* Michael has a cousin going for a masters degree and asked  about data science as an option (lots of money in it).  Michael's advice is doing get into tech if you don't enjoy it. \n\n* If you're so focused on what needs to be great in the outcome, you are almost missing the point of why you are doing it in the first place.  If you take the time to go through the process and be truly great at it, the outcomes will be there and so will the learnings. \n\n* If you start from this context point, perhaps the setbacks don't feel like setbacks (i.e. setback on a project is a step forward on a learning journey).  It's hard to conceptualize this until one takes a step back. \n\n* This is arguably one of the most challenging things you will do.  Michael sometimes finds himself in a state of just wanting to get something finished rather than enjoying the process. \n\n* Michael is practicing what he preaches but has faults just like other humans. \n\n* You can take yourself to the next level once you start to catch this feeling / realize it has happened to you. \n\n* Once you can start to realize you are thinking about the things we've discussed on the show today, that's when you know you have taken yourself to the next level. \n\n* You're not going to be able to do any of the things discussed and be perfect. \n\n*\"We are humans.  We will mess up.  We will constantly fail, but the difference is if you fail, are you willing to get back up?  If you are, that differentiates you from 90% of the world.\" - Michael Levan \n\n* If this was easy it would not be worth doing.  If it was easy everyone would be successful, but it's not easy. \n\n## 27:16 - Reasons for Starting a Business \n\n* Michael describes the reasons for going out on his own. \n\n* He is very opinionated.  Michael shares the scenario of working on something extremely important to the business but being directed by management to change direction and focus on something of lesser value \"because it's your job.\"   \n\n* Michael hates the feeling of being told not to do something that is driving value. \n\n* Working for himself allows Michael to work on the things he wants to work on and which he also knows are generating value. \n\n* Working for a company means you are working on things because you have to do it. \n\n* Michael does not like putting his fate in the hands of others. \n\n* Many feel having a full time job is more stable. \n\n* Michael would argue this is less stable than going out on your own because: \n\n* You are putting your fate in the hands of another team like sales, marketing, or the CEO of the company for which you work.  If the company has layoffs or goes under you may have done nothing wrong and could still lose your job. \n\n* Getting a consistent paycheck makes you feel like all is well, but one day it could all go away.  Then what do you do if that was your only source of income?   \n\n* When on your own, if something goes wrong, it is likely your fault.  You can learn from it, adapt, and change.  It's all on your shoulders, which is a phenomenal thing. \n\n* When working on your own, you have multiple income streams.  If something goes away (depending on size of client, etc.), there are multiple other things on which you can fall back (other clients / ability to get more clients). \n\n* If Michael is working for another company, they have every right to tell him what he can and cannot do as it relates to giving a conference talk about a specific subject, if he can go and tinker with a new technology, when he can take off work, etc. \n\n* Michael is a passionate technologist and doesn't want someone else telling him how to live his life. \n\n* The paycheck is a false sense of stability.  You are only as stable as the rest of the employees at the company.  If they are not doing their job you aren't very stable at all. \n\n* John mentions humans are bad at judging risk.  We don't often want to face what is risky. \n\n* You can see a business is in trouble from the outside, and people within the business may not want to acknowledge it.   \n\n* Perhaps if you are going to work for a company, one should have a way to measure and assess the risk to the company's longevity and health in a negative way. \n\n* Think about working in technology in the travel industry during a pandemic, for example.  The business could be in trouble because no one can spend money on travel. \n\n* Another scenario is a business that makes a majority of its revenues within a specific region of the country and then that region experiencing a natural disaster. \n\n* John explains how diversifying revenues across client bases and geographies can be a benefit compared to working for a company directly as an employee. \n\n* Michael believes there is a middle ground.  If you're working for a company and did not sign a moonlighting clause, legally you can moonlight (i.e. cannot be fired for it). \n\n* Many companies are ok with employees doing side work.  For example, Michael knows people whose company supports their decision to build courses on top of their day job. \n\n* But if you are doing side work, how much time do you really have to do it if you already have a full time job? \n\n* How can you truly diversify without working 15 hours per day? \n\n* It depends on the job and the workload as well as the industry you're in. \n\n## 36:17 - Finding Stability \n\n* Michael feels he is more stable working for himself. \n\n* He has funds in the bank for a rainy day for one thing. \n\n* Next phase is equity in his house. \n\n* He also invests in stocks and other areas. \n\n* Michael is very particular about his finances and prepared for times without income if things happen that way. \n\n* Before going out on his own, Michael was moonlighting to some extent.  It was not that he had a full time job, quit, and then became successful. \n\n* There were a number of bad months and a lot of uncertainty. \n\n* He bounced back and forth between working for a company and for himself before becoming stable. \n\n* Michael was very poor growing up.  Going through the transition of not making money for a while wasn't extremely damaging to him as a result. \n\n* Some of this is about mindset.  Think about the person who grew up in a family that was extremely financially stable.   \n\n* Going out on your own and not making money for a couple of months could really sting compared to someone who grew up used to not having money. \n\n* It also depends on how bad you want it.  Michael knows what he wants out of life and how to get it.  There are going to be times when he doesn't make any money because things will not always be peachy. \n\n* There are so many factors that go into a decision like this. \n\n* \"Everything is always moving.  And you have to be moving with it.  Otherwise, be prepared to fail.\" - Michael Levan \n\n* Success doesn't just mean money. \n\n* You never make enough money.  Michael has had months when he made nothing and others where he made someone's entire salary. \n\n* Michael encourages us to look at success about how you feel and whether you are prepared for life. \n\n* Michael shares a quote from the movie [Rocky Balboa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Balboa_(film)) - \"You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.\"   \n\n* See also [this video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Vg4uyYwEk) to hear the clip in context of a conversation between Rocky Balboa and his son.  \n\n* This is the uncomfortable reality of success. \n\n* John points out we may not yet have the skills to be valuable enough to go on our own, and this means we need to go through the process of gaining more skills.   \n\n* It's not just flipping a light switch and you're there. \n\n* The first two times Michael tried to go out on his own he failed miserably, blowing through a large amount of savings simply because he did not have the skills. \n\n* Michael was not valued enough in the space to consider himself an independent consultant.   \n\n* You have to build yourself to a certain point.  However, you don't know you're there yet until you give it a shot.  Michael learned quickly the first two times he was not ready. \n\n* If you do give it a shot make sure you are in a good situation.  The first time Michael tried going out on his own he was not in a good financial situation.  The second time he was in a good financial situation but because he was not ready blew through his savings. \n\n## 42:16 - Talent Cycles and Parting Thoughts \n\n* In today's tech world being up to date on your skills makes it incredibly straightforward to find a job. \n\n* Michael reads almost daily about the number of engineering jobs available being higher than those who can fill them. \n\n* It's easy to say \"I'll be fine.\"  If you always have in demand skills you will always be able to find something. \n\n* The way to de-risk the process is to stay up to date with your skills, which takes time and effort.   \n\n* The cycle can be too many jobs and not enough people, but sometimes the cycle is too many people and not enough jobs. \n\n* If a people shortage is happening in the industry, maybe that is a good time to test yourself in going out on your own. \n\n* John compares this to a powerlifter getting into peak performance and shape, timing it just right so that a safe test can be conducted to determine if more training is needed. \n\n* The key thing is you have to do it to know.  If you never try to go out on your own, you will never know you're ready.   \n\n* There's always a balancing act to remember. \n\n* There is no way to know if you're ready to go out on your own until you give it a shot.  That can be scary, but so is staying at a company too long. \n\n* Nick says we've come full circle not only from a fitness standpoint but on the learning topic. \n\n* It's like the balance is the mindfulness of the feedback loop you should constantly put yourself through. \n\n* Michael says all of this stems from deep work and the formation of habits discussed in previous parts of this interview. \n\n* What you've heard on the show is achievable by every person in the world.  The only thing stopping you is you. \n\n* Michael references a video clip of Steve Jobs from the 1990s. \n\n* There's a path we all follow from birth to death (school, job, family, death). \n\n* Once you poke life and realize something can pop out the other side, you can't go back to a former way of thinking. \n\n* We are extremely lucky to be here.  Michael cites a 1 in 5 billion chance that a sperm fertilizes an egg leading to the birth of a human. \n\n* If you have a 1 in 5 billion chance at life, there should be no reason to have a defeating attitude (i.e. say \"I can't do this\"). \n\n* Michael tells us there is no excuse that should keep you from going and being successful. \n\n* Michael feels very fortunate to have turned out as he is today based on his childhood. \n\n* We have short life spans on this earth to build something.  And inside that, you might have 30-50 years if you are lucky to really do something, which is not a lot of time. \n\n* If you are going to do something, you might as well just go and do it because we are humans (and likely all take that for granted).  You can shape your own reality. \n\n* Find Michael on Twitter ([@TheNJDevOpsGuy](https://twitter.com/TheNJDevOpsGuy)) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellevan/). \n\n* And remember to check out Michael's podcast, [Kubernetes Unpacked](https://packetpushers.net/?s=kubernetes+unpacked) on Packet Pushers. \n\n* Episodes mentioned in the outro: \n\n* [[Episode 181]] [Episode 181](https://nerd-journey.com/crossing-the-burnout-fault-line-with-bill-kindle-2-3/) with Bill Kindle and the burnout story \n\n* [[Episode 19]] [Episode 19](https://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/) -

In today's episode we share part 1 of a discussion with Phil Monk detailing Phil's progression from college to monitoring desk to support to consulting.  We’ll also discuss some of the challenges Phil has experienced as a result of being dyslexic and what he has done to overcome those challenges.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-23-2022 \n\nTopics – Meet [[Phil Monk]], Getting into Tech, With Great Management Comes Opportunity, Education and University, Tense Situations, Entering Consultancy, Organizational Acceptance of the Confirmed Dyslexic, Accommodations for Thinking Differently, The Advocate and Overcomer  \n\n=========================== \n\n## 3:41 - Meet Phil Monk \n\n* [Phil Monk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipmonk/) is currently a Critical Accounts Program Architect at #VMware based in the UK.   \n\n* Many congrats to Phil who was promoted to #Principal Architect between our recording and the release of this episode! \n\n* The critical accounts team is the highest form of escalation within VMware related to customer challenges.  The team do not operate on a break fix level like support but rather focus on stabilization, looking at wider operational and architectural challenges, trying to determine the root cause of problems, understanding business issues, and helping the customer create a better path forward. \n\n* Phil has done this type of work for a little while and really enjoys it.   \n\n* The critical accounts team formed in 2021 as an offshoot from the customer success team and stays engaged for a few months to assist customers in consuming VMware technologies in a better way. \n\n* Some customer challenges are architectural and some are operational.  Phil and a number of his colleagues and others in the principal community are working on ways to make it easier for customers to onboard and consume VMware technologies. \n\n## 6:44 - Getting into Tech \n\n* Phil started in IT when he was 17 (about 2004). \n\n* When Phil was younger his father bought the family a computer.  Not long after that Phil took it apart and put it back together. \n\n* Phil was fascinated with how everything worked together and knew he wanted to do something in technology. \n\n* Phil started doing some programming here and there on a Windows 95 machine (using DOS) and later got a Commodore 64. \n\n* Phil even tinkered around with trying to build his own games. \n\n* In school in the UK, they do the General Certificate of Secondary Education or [GCSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education), which is the equivalent of a test that US high schools do. \n\n* Phil chose IT for these, and they refused since Phil did not specialize in the subject and his track record of being a bit mischievous at times. \n\n* In the UK, when you do a college course, you have to take an aptitude test. \n\n* Phil went for the lowest level IT course he could.  His test scores had not been great previous to that.  Phil struggled with test taking largely due to his dyslexia diagnosis and a lack of help. \n\n* These aptitude tests in particular were on the computer.  He aced the first one as well as the second one.  After performing well on the 3rd level test, Phil was placed in a more advanced course (unusual for someone his age). \n\n* Phil enjoyed the time at college and learned a great deal.  He was hired by a company called [T-Systems](https://www.linkedin.com/company/t-systems) based in the UK (a global systems integrator that would recruit from local colleges). \n\n* Phil's father was a mechanic, and in his youth he would work on various projects with his father and grandfather such as building go carts. \n\n* If Phil didn't know how something worked he was determined to figure it out, which naturally led to pulling it apart in many cases.  This tinkering and desire to understand naturally made him more inquisitive. \n\n* Phil started building computers not long after he took the family computer apart.  He and his dad would go to computer fairs and work to build gaming computers that would run games like [Carmageddon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmageddon) or [Roller Coaster Tycoon](https://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/). \n\n* At some point Phil and his dad started building custom computers in interesting places (refrigerators, in alloy wheels, and even some that got displayed in Custom PC Magazine in the UK). \n\n## 11:42 - With Great Management Comes Opportunity \n\n* At T-Systems, Phil was hired and put in front of a monitoring desk.  Many systems integrators in the area where Phil lived at the time were running service desks. \n\n* Phil learned a lot at T-Systems and eventually progressed into support.  This was part of the itch to understand what was broken and how to fix it combined with folks noticing Phil had the technical acumen to fix the issues. \n\n* The monitoring desk was a bit like a network operations center.  \n\n* John mentions the starting point here in monitoring is at a higher level than support (see the alert for a problem and have to call someone else to do the fixing, or see only the symptom rather than the result as Phil says). \n\n* Phil gives a good example of an automobile company's mainframe issues (seeing them but not being able to resolve them). \n\n* Phil cites working under a good manager at the monitoring desk and this person as well as the manager of the Wintel and VMware group (the team whose issues Phil found most interesting) recognizing that Phil was both capable and wanted to progress. \n\n* A number of younger folks who came to work the monitoring desk would stay for 6 months and then leave.  Phil worked it for 18 months.  Many of the other members of the team had been there a long time and didn't really have a desire to progress (comfortable salary and shift manager). \n\n* The Wintel / VMware manager gave Phil access to certain systems and some formal training.  Phil even spent some of his days off shadowing this team so he could learn. [[Managers Giving Opportunities]]\n\n* This team (second line support) eventually offered Phil a job at double the salary of his role at the monitoring desk.  Phil saw it as a good way into something different. \n\n* Nick makes the point that not everyone has a deep desire to fix a root problem but is looking to get back to functional, even if it is with a continual band aid. \n\n* There was a project team that would do new technology implementations and the support team.  Phil chose to dive into support rather than pursuing the project team in the beginning. \n\n* Phil began working on a team of 4 and eventually ended up on a team of 2 since he and a colleague were fielding all the calls.  Other personnel were reallocated within the company. \n\n* Phil learned so much in these roles and is appreciative of the two managers who believed in him.  He also didn't have a degree. \n\n## 17:14 - Education and University \n\n* Is there an IT degree in the UK? \n\n* Yes.  There are the GCSEs (mentioned previously, equivalent to high school in the US). \n\n* After this come [A-levels](https://www.internationalschoolparent.com/articles/what-are-a-levels/), which is a next step in getting to university. \n\n* There are also [NVQs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Vocational_Qualification) or National Vocational Qualifications.  This would not be the kind of thing you would pursue if you're exceptional in a specific area (or not looked upon that way). \n\n* One challenge Phil ran into was his #dyslexia getting identified late.  He also never felt a need to go to a university, preferring to learn in a hands on way through experience. [[Neurodiversity]]\n\n* In the UK there seems to be a clearer understanding of [[class boundaries]] whereas in the US we tend work hard to pretend that they do not exist. \n\n* When Phil was in school, the political party in the UK enabled free university education for certain levels of earners who wanted to pursue it. \n\n* This policy was changed to require yearly fees of 10,000 - 12,000 pounds being required of those who attend universities (i.e. only go if you are wealthy). \n\n* Education can certainly be class defining in the UK. \n\n* John adds that in the US there can be interviews to determine fit (i.e. if someone is class appropriate) even if these are not really acknowledged.  \n\n* We usually separate blue collar and white collar jobs (see [this article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/wealth-management/120215/blue-collar-vs-white-collar-different-social-classes.asp) for the differences). \n\n* We also pretend there is a lot of mobility and desire mobility from working class to white collar background.  And maybe that is not so true. \n\n* John says it's uncomfortable to step across a hard class boundary. \n\n* Phil's wife attended a university because she wanted to be a teacher.  That is a job that requires university experience and turned out to be something Phil's wife did not enjoy.  \n\n## 21:49 - Tense Situations \n\n* Sometimes when people call support, they want acknowledgement that someone understands the problem and hears them even if the fix cannot be immediate.  Many who call support are already upset when they call in to get help. \n\n* As a 19 or 20 year old it was a bit of a shock when Phil progressed up to 3rd line support and had people calling and shouting at him that something did not work. \n\n* Phil tried to calm the person down and let them know he was genuinely trying to help. \n\n* Phil is generally outgoing and has no trouble going up and talking to people.  He tries to search for things he might have in common with others. \n\n* For the most part Phil feels he adapted pretty well, making mistakes along the way and learning lessons. \n\n* After leaving T-Systems Phil went into consulting.  He shares the story of making a mistake implementing something which took down production systems for a customer and not really knowing how to process people shouting at him for it. \n\n* It took time to learn how to deal with people who were upset, but Phil feels it was a natural progression of learning. \n\n## 24:07 - Entering Consultancy \n\n* In the T-Systems teams there was a project side and a support side.  Phil learned loads in the support role about how people consume software and what they expect from it. \n\n* Phil also learned a great deal about infrastructure, networking, and application performance.  This was all absorbed over 2 years. \n\n* At one point Phil started working with a member of the project team (Tony Butler) who turned out to be a mentor to Phil (perhaps without Tony even realizing it at the time). \n\n* Phil learned that it wasn't just about clicking buttons and installing software but about how to shape it around what businesses want. \n\n* The technology around this time was a bit more focused on Citrix and before Phil got deeper experience in Microsoft and VMware technologies. \n\n* T-Systems eventually decided they were going to outsource their support.  Being young and not really knowing what that meant, Phil immediately went out and found a new job as a consultant for QDos. \n\n* Phil worked there for 6 months on a short-term contract and learned an amazing amount by going to visit customers, asking questions, creating documentation, not installing software in a happenstance way. \n\n* Nick feels there is a consultative approach that many support engineers take when trying to fix a problem. \n\n* Phil speaks to some of the relatable experience from his support days like knowledge of different ways things could fail impacting how an architecture gets developed to avoid them, etc. \n\n* Understanding how people operate software firsthand can help you make decisions on how something should be implemented or could be implemented better.   \n\n* It's the exposure to this that makes for a better consultant. \n\n* John mentions it is this type of feedback (the processes people work through) can help us understand why there are architectural philosophies and reasons for them existing. \n\n* At this point Phil had 3 different views of the industry within 5 years of starting his IT career: \n\n* The monitoring role \n\n* The support role and a lot of break / fix work (actively taking part in fixing a problem) \n\n* The project side and building the architecture in which failures can occur \n\n* Phil continued in consulting for a number of years, working for various VMware and Microsoft partners and moving around a little to other companies. \n\n* Phil ended up in a managed services provider consulting role with some responsibility for professional service delivery for Virtualized IT (which later became [Virtustream](https://www.linkedin.com/company/virtustream/)). \n\n* Nick normally associates consultancy with the implementation of a technology solution as well as the planning and design of it. \n\n* Phil mentioned in smaller organizations where he worked after leaving T-Systems, it was a different type of consultancy than what Phil had did after joining XOR and later VMware.  In these small organizations you often designed, implemented, acted as short term support, and possibly short term operational handover or project management. \n\n* Phil says he learned project management skills through this process which were not extremely exciting but were very helpful when he moved on to XOR and later VMware (things like time estimates, etc.). \n\n## 31:55 - Organizational Acceptance of the Confirmed Dyslexic \n\n* John mentions that getting accurate time estimates for work is a skill that must be learned and sharpened over time. \n\n* Phil had a bit of a challenge with time estimates because of his dyslexia.  He does not read quickly at all (and many others with dyslexia have the same issue). \n\n* People with dyslexia may have to go back through the material multiple times to fully comprehend it and process it. \n\n* Phil had to learn to take the extra time needed into consideration when providing time estimates for others. \n\n* Documentation was also a challenge.  Writing things down was slow for Phil. \n\n* He would produce a design and need to lay it aside for a couple of days to truly allow himself to read it as it was written (fresh) and not read it as he expected it to be.  This process allowed Phil to get his design documents customer ready. \n\n* Phil didn't know he needed to build these into his time estimates until probably 2-3 years into his career. \n\n* This matches John's experience of getting diagnosed with [[ADHD|Attention Deficit Disorder]] (ADD) as an adult and needing to work on some of his coping skills. \n\n* John says it takes an understanding organization to make accommodations for all the implications challenges like these present. \n\n* Listen to John's example about various tasks he had to do when working for VMware.  Being slower at something cannot mean we should not do it.  A lack of practice makes the muscles atrophy. \n\n* Phil did not realize while at T-Systems that his dyslexia had the impact mentioned above.  Some of the smaller companies he worked at we're too keen on allowing extra time for design review that Phil would need.   \n\n* At one particular employer, Phil was told if he could not complete something within a specific amount of time he should leave.   \n\n* Phil chose to resign from this company because his leadership could not appreciate what he was explaining to them around his dyslexia. \n\n* At the same time this company had customers coming in and asking for Phil to work on their project, and it seemed like his leadership was conflicted on what choice to make. \n\n* Phil left because the company did not understand the way he liked and needed to work. \n\n* This reminds Nick of [[Bill Kindle]]'s story and knowing what he needed from an employer. \n\n* See [Episode 180](https://nerd-journey.com/hired-on-the-spot-with-bill-kindle-1-3/) and [Episode 181](https://nerd-journey.com/crossing-the-burnout-fault-line-with-bill-kindle-2-3/) for more on this. [[Episode 180]] [[Episode 181]]\n\n* John mentions these negative experiences shape what we go looking for in our next job, and when we have the luxury to do so, referring to the list of things we need our employer to understand and appreciate about us as individuals (the ideal work environment). [[Career Experiences Shape Career Desires]]\n\n* Phil says this happened when he went and worked for XOR (a company that provided professional services to the channel), which was the company he worked for right before coming to VMware.   \n\n* Phil was hired at XOR because he had been recommended by customers who had used him previously.  He was contacted by XOR to interview. \n\n* During the process Phil was very transparent that he needed the extra time we discussed earlier. \n\n* Another thing that Phil used to help was to record conversations with customers.  For many dyslexic people (including Phil), short term memory is an issue. \n\n* Phil also mentioned he liked to use specific equipment, and the company (XOR) was very supportive. \n\n* The company got Phil some covers for his screens so he could see certain colors.  One of the challenges with his dyslexia has to do with seeing colors. \n\n* It was communicated to XOR's customers that Phil would need extra time.  Sometimes they were ok with it and sometimes not, but Phil felt supported by his employer through all of this and was happy he could express his challenges. \n\n* This was proof that an organization was willing to understand and make accommodations based on Phil's needs whereas before it was not even in the realm of possibility. \n\n## 39:52 - Accommodations for Thinking Differently \n\n* Phil sees his dyslexia as a positive thing and doesn't like to say he was diagnosed but rather confirmed dyslexic, which happened  around the time he was 17. \n\n* As Phil came out of his teens into his twenties he better understood some of the challenges he had with reading and taking tests like the GCSE. \n\n* After having the poor experience with one employer Phil realized it was best to tell XOR so that they didn't expect him to do something he could not do.  He was so happy his employer embraced this. \n\n* Nick says he believes it is a mixed bag once people understand they are dyslexic as to whether they accept it or don't want to hear about it. \n\n* Nick's daughter is also dyslexic. \n\n* [Sally Shaywitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Shaywitz) defines dyslexia as an unexpected difficulty in reading or writing in an otherwise intelligent human.  The full definition from the Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity can be found [here](https://dyslexia.yale.edu/dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia/).  [[Sally Shaywitz]]\n\n* When Phil was 12 or 13 his friends would read 2-3 books per month, and he would struggle to read half a book, most of the time forgetting what he had read as well. \n\n* Phil looks at dyslexia as something that makes his brain think differently. \n\n* To take an example, Phil was going through a principal promotion panel just a few days before this recording at VMware.   \n\n* In the template slide deck that Phil was given, it stated to give two examples of [EPIC2 values](https://news.vmware.com/company/vmwares-culture-built-epic2-values) of how candidates exhibit these values.  Phil interpreted this to mean he needed to give 2 example for each of the 5 values. \n\n* Everyone else interpreted this as giving examples of just 2 values.  Phil presented all values and explained to the review board that he took it to mean 2 examples of each value. \n\n* Part of John feels like we should seek to become less ambiguous without becoming legalistic. \n\n* For example he stopped using the word bi-weekly (could mean twice a week or every 2 weeks). \n\n* People may not pay attention to ambiguity until it impacts them and their performance. \n\n* John's cheeky question is whether the ambiguity of the slides in this example Phil gave was tied to performance of the individual who wrote the slides. \n\n## 44:54 - The Advocate and Overcomer \n\n* Writing is also a challenge for Phil.  Most people with dyslexia have similar handwriting (which is due to coordination). \n\n* But coordination does not always impact dyslexics as much as [dyspraxia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-coordination-disorder-dyspraxia-in-adults/) might. \n\n* In the UK they try and teach you to touch type it.  Phil says while reading something they need to type, someone who has dyslexia or dyspraxia will stop after typing for a few seconds before they continue (kind of like your brain needs a reset from coordinating what you are reading, what you are typing, and the hand movements on the keyboard). \n\n* This is pretty common.  Phil does volunteering for the scouts in the UK for kids ages 12-14 and sees this same behavior in the kids who are dyslexic.  It's a strange feeling to see something you might be doing in someone else who may not understand why they are doing it. \n\n* Phil got over this by stopping touch typing and reviewing what he typed at a later time during read back. \n\n* Tools like [Grammarly] can help and do help, but you don't want to use them in a way that makes you completely reliant on them. \n\n* Phil mentioned earlier that he does a read back as written step to review his designs (to ensure what he wrote is what he meant). \n\n* Phil may mean to say he's going to record a podcast later but actually say he's going down to the shops to buy something.  It can be that drastic.  And he's reading it as what he meant to say. \n\n* In design documents, the errors are usually words in the wrong place or the meaning of words being wrong. \n\n* For example, Phil may have left the word \"is\" completely out, but he's reading it as if it is there. \n\n* Sometimes putting the document in a different medium (printing it or changing from Word to PowerPoint for example) or letting it sit for a few days before reviewing helps him to see the errors. \n\n* Nick mentions there have been a number of times where his daughter used the wrong word in a sentence without realizing it, but listening carefully usually gives a good guess at what the person meant. \n\n* Phil has loads of support inside VMware and many will review his document for correctness.  Sometimes people are shy about pointing out mistakes.   \n\n* Phil lets people know if he's made a mistake they need to tell him.  At first others may feel like they are being brutal, but once he explains some of his challenges to others, over the course of his career the feedback has been very helpful when people review things he's written. \n\n* John mentions the mental space of editing someone else's document is non-trivial.  The editing space is different from the creative space, and when we give feedback it is about the writing and not the person. \n\n* Ignorance can lead to discrimination when it comes to neurodiversity.  Because someone takes longer to do something than others might, people could treat them as if they are incompetent when it fact is simply a difference in the way the person's brain works.  We should not allow these differences to impact perception of someone's personhood. \n\n* Phil mentions inside VMware right now he's asking people to review things written in English whose first language is not English, and they are correcting Phil.  They may assist with grammar and spelling errors.  Even in these situations Phil has to explain and point out the challenges with dyslexia, and once reviewers understand their perception totally changes (i.e. no longer thinking Phil can't seem to learn his first language). \n\n* You can find Phil on social media for follow up: \n\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipmonk/) \n\n* [Twitter -

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we share part 2 of an interview with Phil Monk detailing some resources for understanding dyslexia, the story of Phil getting a job offer out of nowhere, Phil's pursuit of the VCDX certification, and how we can all learn to think like technical architects.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-23-2022 \n\n[Phil Monk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipmonk/) is currently a Principal Architect in the Critical Accounts Program at VMware based in the UK.  Catch part 1 of our discussion with Phil in [Episode 185](https://nerd-journey.com/make-accommodations-for-success-with-phil-monk-1-2/). \n\nTopics – Resources for Understanding Dyslexia, A Unique Offer, Pursuing VCDX, Think Like an Architect [[Phil Monk]] [[Episode 185]] #dyslexia #VCDX [[Neurodiversity]] [[Think Like an Architect]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 4:11 - Resources for Understanding Dyslexia \n\n* Phil mentions [Christopher Campbell](https://www.tiktok.com/@notcampbellsoup) as a good resource for understanding dyslexia.  He makes short TikTok videos and uses humor to promote dyslexia awareness (since he is also dyslexic). [[Christopher Campbell]]\n\n* Christopher makes videos on his own challenges with reading, short term memory, and colors.  Listen to Phil's story about a post confusing emojis like dyslexics can sometimes confuse words.   \n\n* For formal education stuff, there are a number of videos on YouTube. \n\n* Phil has learned not every person is the same in the way they experience challenges.  Certainly writing and spelling challenges are common as is the typing. \n\n* Phil is able to better read PowerPoint slides in dark theme (has trouble reading them and seeing colors in light theme). \n\n* He would ask at previous VMworld conferences about getting a copy of a presentation in dark theme because he could not follow what was happening in light theme. \n\n* Thanks to the [power of difference community](https://news.vmware.com/dei/the-power-of-difference) for neurodiversity inside VMware the slide decks are now issued internally using light and dark theme. [[Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion]]\n\n* If you know someone who is dyslexic, talk to them about their experiences and ask for resources to learn more. \n\n* Nick mentions some books: \n\n* [The Dyslexic Advantage](https://www.amazon.com/Dyslexic-Advantage-Unlocking-Hidden-Potential/dp/0452297923) by [[Brock L. Eide]] M.D. M.A. and [[Fernette F. Eide]] M.D talks about strengths of the dyslexic brain, one of them being mechanical. [[The Dyslexic Advantage]]\n\n* [Overcoming Dyslexia](https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Dyslexia-Complete-Science-Based-Problems/dp/0679781595) by [[Sally Shaywitz]].  [[Overcoming Dyslexia]]\n\n* Note that both of these are available on Audible! \n\n* Nick's daughter's has trouble with spelling, memory is not bad if she can hear something (usually has it down once she hears it), and she remembers experiences very well (might even remember something that was said to her only once). \n\n* It's interesting that a weakness in one area can manifest itself as a strength / advantage in another.  John gives the example of the mechanical strength.  You could learn other things almost by casting other things onto that mechanical mental model. \n\n* John has seen other people do this and didn't really understand it at the time.  Listen to John's story about a college math professor explaining differential equations using the illustration of a spring. \n\n* This process can help with learning abstract things. \n\n* Phil mentioned he started out recording customer conversations to help with memory challenges. He later learned through a friend of a friend about the concept of a [memory palace](https://artofmemory.com/wiki/How_to_Build_a_Memory_Palace/). [[Memory Palace]]\n\n* It took Phil about 2 years to really learn how to do this for himself. \n\n* If Phil comes across something he really needs to remember, he will picture the home where he grew up in is his mind (which he knows really well).  Phil then maps the thing he needs to remember to an event that happened in his childhood home.  This allows Phil to recall it and use the mnemonic later for memory recall. \n\n* This has worked pretty well for Phil and has been better than just recording things. \n\n* This reminds John of [Moonwalking with Einstein](https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530) by [[Joshua Foer]] (also available on Audible.  In the book the author enters a memory competition and wins using the idea of the memory palace to do it.  Nick and John talk about some of the things contestants have to memorize (such as a deck of cards, phone numbers, etc.), but see also the [World Memory Championships](https://www.worldmemorychampionships.com/).  [[Moonwalking With Einstein]]\n\n* It's interesting that the memory palace can be used as a coping mechanism for dyslexia. \n\n* John mentions [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), sharing that it is like a series of connected nodes with the nodes and links between them being equally important. [[Personal Knowledge Management]]\n\n* It's very writing based, and tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) can be used for this.  You can create a thought node and radial connections to other thoughts.  This allows for a visual representation and a spatial representation of the information. \n\n* See also [Episode 156](https://nerd-journey.com/better-notes-better-you-with-josh-duffney-1-2/) and [Episode 157](https://nerd-journey.com/take-note-of-your-time-with-josh-duffney-2-2/) with [[Josh Duffney]] for more on personal knowledge management and the smart notes methodology. [[Episode 156]] [[Episode 157]]\n\n* Much of the ideas come from the book [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/1542866502).  This is also available on Audible.   [[How to Take Smart Notes]] [[How to Take Smart Notes in Obsidian]]\n\n* Phil uses [MindNode](https://www.mindnode.com/), which is a mind mapping tool that is similar to the idea John mentioned.  Phil will often use this tool to dump out his thoughts when there is too much going on in his head.  [[MindNode]]\n\n* John was a bookworm as a kid, reading at times 5 books per week.  In many ways it was a manifestation of his [[ADHD|ADD]].   \n\n* He had the hyperfocus but never the hyperactivity and would cope by hyperfocusing on reading.  This was often times at the cost of paying attention in class. \n\n* As a member of [Generation X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X), John sometimes is skeptical of new mediums like TikTok, but he feels like one of the most amazing things is people using this medium to talk about and express their otherness (using the platform to educate). \n\n* John mentions [MindTools](https://www.mindtools.com/) as another helpful resource. [[MindTools]]\n\n* He stumbled upon this when looking for ways to explain to his management how they could better [manage a person with ADHD](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/managing-adhd.htm).  This article also contained advice for colleagues / team members of someone with dyslexia. \n\n* There is a good article on [how to manage a person with dyslexia](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/manage-dyslexia.htm) on the site.  See also [Dyslexia: Strength Not Shame](https://www.mindtools.com/blog/dyslexia-strengths/). \n\n## 18:22 - A Unique Offer \n\n* Back when Phil was working at XOR, he was working with a customer on vCloud Director.  At the time (around 2012), VMware professional services did not have anyone that could deliver an engagement on this software (nor did partners in the area). \n\n* Phil started getting phone calls asking if he was looking for another job.  He said he was not.  But, he did end up getting asked to work on this particular project. \n\n* There was a very heated exchange between personnel from the partner engaged at this customer (called 2E2) and Phil about his abilities to deliver the very technical implementation of vCloud Director. He was about 26 at the time with most of them being older and a bit more seasoned.  That, and they didn't know vCloud Director like he did. \n\n* It was challenging to work with the people from this partner, but Phil did his best and worked with them. \n\n* At some point a number of professional services personnel from VMware showed up on site (about 6 people who were delivering a number of other VMware products for this customer. \n\n* Phil started working less with the 2E2 folks and more with the professional services folks from VMware. \n\n* After about 6 weeks, he was getting along with these folks really well.  They treated him with an incredible amount of respect.  Phil was impressed because these people worked for a company where he had always wanted to work (VMware). \n\n* One day one of the professional services personnel told Phil there would be a job opening on the VMware website in about an hour.  When Phil could not see it, one of the professional services folks sent it to him (job posting only viewable via that link). \n\n* Phil applied for the job, and an hour later he had a contract in front of him offering him the job.  Phil was ecstatic about this. \n\n* As a result Phil did not quite know how to tell his employer (XOR) that he got another job.  Phil had been expecting to get an end of year bonus in a few weeks. \n\n* Phil received some advice from a former manager at T-Systems that said he should just be honest with his employer and let them know he was leaving only because of an amazing opportunity. \n\n* Phil turning in his resignation did not go great.  The company had a bunch of work lined up for Phil at that time.  He stayed on for 12 weeks and helped them find a replacement, leaving on good terms. \n\n* After joining VMware Phil worked on vCloud Director engagements for about 1.5 years before branching out into other products. \n\n* You never know what situation could be a formal job interview without you realizing it. \n\n* At the time Phil joined, the professional services team was small with him being about the 7th employee.  When he moved into the customer success organization inside VMware in 2018, there were more than 120 people in professional services. \n\n* Phil learned a great deal while working in the professional services organization, and he mentioned it helped him get his [VCDX](https://www.vmware.com/learning/certification/vcdx-dcv.html). \n\n## 23:43 - Pursuing #VCDX \n\n* VCDX is the VMware Certified Design Expert certification and the highest level you can obtain.  Phil is VCDX-DCV (datacenter virtualization) #274 as shown in the [VCDX Directory](https://vcdx.vmware.com/).   \n\n* Achieving the certification requires a defense in front of a panel and not many pass. \n\n* Phil is not a panelist and likes to mentor others who are seeking after this certification to build up the community.  Phil cites great mentors as one of the reasons he passed the defense, which did not happen until his 3rd attempt. \n\n* Phil is a target driven individual.  Without something to aim for, he gets really uncomfortable. \n\n* Phil was in professional services at VMware since 2013.  His first VCDX attempt was in 2016, the second in 2017, and the 3rd and final attempt in 2018 where he passed. \n\n* Phil had also set a goal of moving from a senior consultant to an architect, furthering the skills he had learned from his consulting days before coming to Vmware - requirements gathering, risk assessment, business alignment, designing and making decisions, how to do design board reviews with customers, how to have challenging conversations, etc. \n\n* Moving up to a consulting architect moves you up in pay band and requires some justification.  Phil worked on VCDX while he was working toward this. \n\n* Phil says his first attempt at VCDX was utterly terrible.  He went in looking to get some valuable feedback for the second attempt at it.  The second pass was close but did not pass. \n\n* To be able to do a defense you have to submit a design that is evaluated against a blueprint with criteria and passed.  Phil's design was passed through to defense the first time, and it was the defense where he fell flat. \n\n* The design document was one he had done for a customer.  It took Phil a long time to get his document in the right shape. \n\n* Phil used several mentors when preparing for his 2nd defense attempt who helped him review the document. \n\n* Through this process, Phil discovered [Speechify](https://speechify.com/), which can be leveraged to read your documents back to you as they are written.  Phil continues to use this tool even today. \n\n* Getting feedback when you don't measure up is hard.  Phil says not everyone agrees with the way feedback on VCDX defenses is delivered. \n\n* For those who do not pass the defense, the feedback is given via a template pointing back to evaluation criteria and standards.  In many ways candidates are expected to figure out where they failed. \n\n* John mentions there can be a tension between those who are looking for a cookie cutter architecture and those who build architectures for customers based on business requirements, limitations, etc. \n\n* Phil has had some of these exact conversations.  It is difficult to communicate the value of properly building an architecture that suits the need when they may not understand the process. \n\n* Certainly there are some public reference architectures, but if someone wants Phil to produce a design, he lets folks know it is going to take time to understand a number of metrics (what this should do for the business, how it will perform, understand the risks of the choice and how to mitigate them, assumptions made when deploying, etc.). \n\n* John shares a great analogy about someone asking for a standard blueprint to build a skyscraper and how it overlooks many different elements to consider. \n\n* Maybe it makes more sense to present a standard bathroom layout and communicate a couple of assumptions, but this isn't going to work for the skyscraper (far too many variables there). \n\n## 33:18 - Think Like an Architect \n\n* Phil tries to teach his mentees to think more like architects. \n\n* The team Phil works on sits within global support even though he and his peers are architects.  They get people who come into the team that are progressing from being in a support role.  Often time Phil helps enable and guide these folks in an architect's way of thinking. \n\n* One thing Phil emphasizes with people is not to assume anything. \n\n* Many times folks coming from a support or professional services background make a lot of natural assumptions.  Their desire is to jump in and fix or build something without realizing the undocumented assumptions they have made about what the customer really wants. \n\n* People often are scared by documenting to the level of [Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)](https://www.simplilearn.com/project-management-and-the-requirements-traceability-matrix-article). \n\n* Phil tends to encourage people to start with a mind mapping exercise. \n\n* Listen to his example of asking people what they need to know when deploying VCF (VMware Cloud Foundation).  They tend to get all the technical pieces (something we as technologists naturally gravitate toward) but then fall flat. \n\n* For example, what availability does the customer want?  That is not the same as turning on vSphere High Availability and an indication you are making an assumption.  Ask the question.  If the customer wants five 9s of availability, consider the impact of that decision (certain number of hosts required, certain type of storage needed, etc.). \n\n* These then map to risks and mitigations. \n\n* It's not just about the technology.  It's about what you actually want the solution to do.  This is a solution that will host applications, for example, and if it fails and does not come back up for 2 days, who will scream at you? \n\n* Teaching people to ask the right questions is really what Phil's methodology is all about, and it's difficult when you have not thought of these things previously. \n\n* John agrees that we forget the focus on the business sometimes as technologists.  We need to consider what something will do for the business and how success will be measured, seeking to align with success metrics of stakeholders involved at all levels of a project. \n\n* John also cites the [VCDX Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-vcdx-podcast/id1461672691) by [[Simon Long]] as being extremely helpful even though it appears to have gone inactive.   [[VCDX Podcast]]\n\n* John listened to it multiple times and felt he got a great deal out of it despite having no aspirations to go after a VCDX himself. \n\n* In a pre-sales technical role it is difficult to be involved enough to come across a design that could be documented for VCDX purposes. \n\n* For John it was a combination of opportunity and desire plus the time commitment. \n\n* Regardless of how far down the path you go, the though processes are applicable and helpful to all of us to remove blind spots.  Listening to others going through the journey can be very useful (and was certainly useful to John). \n\n* Phil says if you're considering VCDX, check out multiple communities and listen to the ones that provide guidance you think will fit and support the way you work. \n\n* Phil had joined one of the larger VCDX communities during his attempts, and at the time the advice was more centered around the presentation deck than the methodology.  Phil felt like this wouldn't help him as much in the defense, which prompted him to seek out individual mentors who provided good advice. \n\n* For example, if you need to put in an introductory slide to allow yourself to feel comfortable, do it.  Don't worry about it taking 30 seconds if it will make you successful. \n\n* John cites this as customized advice rather than blueprinted advice. \n\n* You can find Phil on social media for follow up: \n\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipmonk/) \n\n* [Twitter -

Part 1 of 2 \n\nWhat does a Solution Architect do? \n\n-   VMware structures it differently than other organizations.  The primary role is to identify business problems and help come up with innovative solutions that solve these problems to ensure a desired outcome. \n    \n    -   Example – solving provisioning vs. impact of provisioning on revenue \n        \n\nHow does Solution Architect contrast with the Solution Engineer role? \n\n-   Architect tries to build a solution based on business outcomes \n    \n-   Engineer takes specifications from architect and builds them \n    \n\nTime travel with us back to VMworld 2007 \n\n-   Read more on this from Joseph's Blog \n    \n-   The discussions on innovation (i.e. private clouds, etc.) opened Joseph's eyes and encouraged him to get outside his comfort zone. \n    \n-   He chose to make a pivot to stand out to future employers and started him down a \"hyper\" path of certifications. \n    \n-   Mindset change depends on the person you are. \n    \n    -   Everyone has different life experiences and a unique way of looking at the world. \n        \n    -   We all need to realize how much we have to learn. \n        \n-   Not only were his thoughts about the organization challenged, but he pursued the challenge to make a change. \n    \n    -   Joseph immediately became an advocate for implementing a private cloud and found other internal champions. \n        \n    -   The efforts failed due to too much focus on technology and not enough focus on people and process, but this set him up for success at the next organization. \n        \n-   Did certifications teach valuable career skills? \n    \n    -   Yes – it started with [VCP](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification.html) and proceeded to VCAP (separate design and deploy exams, with the design exam being most valuable in learning architectural concepts) \n        \n    -   Certifications force you to learn new things and look good on resumes. \n        \n    -   See Joseph's [blog post](http://blog.jgriffiths.org/do-it-certifications-really-matter/) on whether IT certifications really matter. \n        \n    -   Joseph is a double [VCDX](http://advice%20to%20vcdx%20candidates%20from%20a%20double%20vcdx/). \n        \n-   Joseph shares the story of someone intentionally working toward the role of CEO by holding various roles within the company. \n    \n-   Joseph switches jobs when he becomes comfortable. \n    \n-   Listen to Joseph's taco shell story and its implications to your situation. \n    \n    -   Guard against letting what you want becoming what other people want. \n        \n-   John draws a parallel between IT's alignment with various internal organizations and its overall value to the company. \n    \n    -   When looking at the value of IT, Joseph encourages us to think of this as a journey and stresses the importance of understanding how we got to where we are and how we can fix where we are. \n        \n    -   The creation of multiple roles leads to better consistency, more efficiency, and a better product. \n        \n    -   This has moved IT workers into siloed teams to the point where they lose touch with the priorities of the business. \n        \n    -   The reality of the world is that IT is driving businesses today and can be a competitive advantage. \n        \n    -   Joseph points to optimizations and efficiencies in areas which may not provide an impact to the business.  \n        \n-   Nick draws a parallel to Joseph's automation talk from the Dallas / Fort Worth SpiceCorps in February 2018 (full video [here](https://community.spiceworks.com/meeting/notes/2598)). \n    \n    -   Joseph stresses the importance of public speaking for professional development and cites leveraging local user groups and conferences to practice.  Feeling uncomfortable is natural. \n        \n    -   Joseph shares an example of process automation in IT and its relationship to business value. \n        \n    -   John mentions workers often worry about automating themselves out of a job. \n        \n    -   The introduction of automation in the automotive industry actually increased the need for workers. \n        \n    -   Employee willingness to adapt and change important. \n        \n    -   John gives the example of installing and configuring a software package not being as valuable as other tasks. \n        \n-   Joseph goes back to the eye-opening VMworld story.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.034588931Z","tags":null},"/Episode-18b":{"title":"Episode 18b","content":"\n# Episode 18b\n\n-   Joseph goes back to the eye-opening VMworld story. \n    \n    -   People have a fear that they cannot change.   \n        \n    -   Have we become so driven by reactionary behavior that we can't close our e-mail client and know what we should be doing? \n        \n    -   Automation often starts with reactionary tasks.  Joseph gives the example of a 17 nanosecond Google outage which was remediated automatically.    \n        \n-   John digs into the logistics of automation and \"choke points\" (or constraints). \n    \n    -   There is only one constraint in any flow or optimization.  Once you remove that constraint, there is still only one constraint. \n        \n    -   Consider the value stream (i.e. what is valuable to the company) and their mapping to capabilities. \n        \n    -   Recommended reading – [[The Goal]], [[The Phoenix Project]] \n        \n-   How can people iterate faster when it comes to career? \n    \n    -   Social skills and emotional intelligence are important to work well with others, which disconnects us from defending technology. \n        \n    -   Read some psychology books on why people think / behave the way they do.  By trying to understand other people's motivations, you will better be able understand your own motivations. \n        \n    -   Listen for John's book recommendation. \n        \n-   Joseph recommended [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/) and learning about the people who attend to get past introversion. \n    \n-   John's book recommendation - [The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists by Neil Strauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game:_Penetrating_the_Secret_Society_of_Pickup_Artists) \n    \n    -   Warning – the book discusses a subculture which some may find offensive but does well in describing human behavior and reactions. \n        \n-   Don't do anything fake.  The process of learning and getting better over time is an iterative process and takes time.   \n    \n-   Not everything is about winning.  The best way to get things accomplished is about compromises. \n    \n-   Drop the [Highlander](http://highlander.wikia.com/wiki/There_can_be_only_one) mentality. \n    \n-   Joseph cites parental advice that there is always someone better than you. \n    \n-   Joseph cited pursuit of certifications as a way to make himself attractive to a potential employer. \n    \n-   Joseph has a mic drop moment about company culture.  Do you agree? \n    \n-   Joseph's Contacts \n    \n    -   Joseph's blog is [https://blog.jgriffiths.org](https://blog.jgriffiths.org/) \n        \n    -   Find him on Twitter [@Gortees](https://twitter.com/Gortees)  \n        \n        -   Don't get discouraged.   \n            \n        -   Take one step to grow (i.e. giving a presentation) that makes you uncomfortable, even if it isn't career related.   \n            \n        -   Don't tackle too many at once. \n            \n    -   Joseph is more than happy to help or mentor people.  Twitter is the best way to reach him.  He only responds every 3 days. \n        \n-   John made up a book part of the way through the episode, but something like what he described does exist: [Unwritten Rules Of Social Relationships - Decoding Social Mysteries through the Unique Perspectives of Autism](https://www.fhautism.com/shop/unwritten-rules-of-social-relationships-decoding-social-mysteries-through-the-unique-perspectives-revised-2017/) by Temple and Sean Barron.

In today's episode, we discuss Nick's 1 Year Check-in at VMware, Part 1. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 2019-1-19 \n\nIntro \n\n===== \n\n* John couldn't remember the name of the [AeroPress](https://aeropressinc.com/) coffee maker. \n\n* [Nerd Journey 001: Career Advancement and Nick’s First Week at VMware](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-001-career-advancement-and-nicks-first-week-at-vmware/) \n\n* [Nerd Journey 010: Seven Month Check-In and Impostor Syndrome](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-010-seven-month-check-in-and-impostor-syndrome/) \n\nTopics – Nick's 1 Year Check-in at VMware, Part 1 - Nick's Observations \n\n========================================================================================================== \n\n## 5:06 – Context And Working From Home \n\n* Nick went from math teacher to business analyst to IT operations to pre-Sales Engineer.  The observations are meant to be about the transition from operations to pre-Sales more so than to be an advertisement for VMware \n\n* Adjusting to working from home instead of going to an office every day \n\n* Coordinating lunch with a homemaker spouse \n\n* Training children to adjust to a parent working from home can be challenging. \n\n* Being present at \"home\" during the day is for work.   \n\n* Listen to Nick's daily routine.  If you work from home, what is yours like? \n\n* John mentions pre-planning meals as a pro tip. \n\n* Don't work through lunch.  Put it down while you eat (away from your desk) to have a mental break. \n\n* Working from home lends itself to working more.  Can it wait until tomorrow? \n\n* Should the daily routine be strict or flexible? \n\n* Nick cites exercise classes as a forced work stoppage \n\n## 14:57 Adjusting to travel \n\n  * Local, out of state, special functions) \n\n  * Expense reports were new to this role.  It took practice to make them routine. \n\n    * John mentions that he uses [Automatic](https://automatic.com/) to track business mileage \n\n    * Have a system, and stick to it \n\n    * Consider the aggregation of marginal gains from [Chasing Excellence](https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Excellence-Building-Fittest-Athletes/dp/1619617285) by [Ben Bergeron](https://benbergeron.com/) \n\n  * Travel to special trainings events can be voluntary \n\n  * Planning meals and customer visits takes time and effort \n\n  * Administrative catch up is necessary after travel days \n\n## 21:36 Expectations coming into the role \n\n* Read [Nick's blog post](http://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2017/12/04/a-letter-to-the-dreamer-be-brave-enough/) about the process involved in getting the job at VMware \n\n* Nick was so focused on getting in the door he essentially had no expectations for day 1 \n\n* You can't know all the questions to ask if you have never done the job \n\n* John and Nick work in different segments and regions even though they have the same title, and their day-to-day experiences are different as a result \n\n* Control what you can; be prepared for what you cannot control \n\n* Nick was initially concerned about his product knowledge coming into the role (i.e. not knowing enough to be effective) \n\n* \"Everyone here is as good as or better than you.\" \n\n* Saying I don't know is acceptable and can give insight into future areas of personal development \n\n* John gives an analogy of the general contractor vs. plumbers, electricians, etc.  \n\n* Sitting in on specialized conversations is a way to learn new things \n\n* Staying on top of new products and releases is challenging \n\n* Meeting a co-worker who lives in the same area \n\n* This is a good networking tactic, even if people are outside your immediate / extended team, in a different role, etc. \n\n* Connections with others inside the organization (whether local or remote) are important to nurture \n\n* Influence in a field facing role \n\n* Influence on customers and products \n\n* Feedback from customers can be passed to product teams to improve the products \n\n* People in the technology field may be unaware of the various roles at companies that produce and sell a product (i.e. product managers, etc.) \n\n* John talks through deal registration as it relates to the purchasing process in channel sales","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-22":{"title":"Episode 22","content":"\n# Episode 22\n\nWelcome to episode 22 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode, we discuss Nick's 1 Year Check-in at VMware, Part 2. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 2019-1-19 \n\nTopics – Nick's 1 Year Check-in at VMware, Part 2, John's Questions \n\n========================================================================================================== \n\n## 4:04 Extracurricular activities \n\n* How has the new role affected the frequency of and type of engagement in community groups? \n\n* Nick is still the co-leader of the [DFW SpiceCorps](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps/dallas-fort-worth), a group that has no affiliation with VMware. \n\n* Attending [VMUGs](https://www.vmug.com/) when possible \n\n* Presented on vSAN in October 2018 in Dallas (video is [here](http://blog.thenetworknerd.com/2018/10/24/if-vsan-powered-the-matrix-extended-edition/)) \n\n* Posting in [Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com) and [MangoLassi](https://mangolassi.it/) when possible \n\n## 6:55 Transitioning from IT operations to Sales \n\n* Nick was nervous about losing technical skills coming into the role. \n\n* There are some aspects of IT operations he misses. \n\n* Meeting with and learning from customers is fun! \n\n* Are you technical enough?  It depends. \n\n* Tailoring the technical level of the conversation to the audience is very important. \n\n* How has carrying a quota affected Nick's honest opinion?  You decide. \n\n## 13:44 Company culture check \n\n* In past roles... \n\n* Most folks in same department in same office \n\n* Worked with folks in other offices and saw them now and then \n\n* Current Role \n\n* First conversations with people (everyone but manager) were via phone / e-mail / chat \n\n* Face-to-face interaction creates a deeper rapport with co-workers \n\n* John's aside on [Matrix organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management) \n\n* Frequent communication is important when working with remote peers \n\n* Some people may work better when in a face-to-face environment \n\n## 18:19 Training Pace \n\n* Nick’s previous employer had a learning platform [Lesson.ly](https://www.lessonly.com/), but it was not as regimented as the quarterly training plans. \n\n* Some of the training must be done on your own to ensure effectiveness. \n\n* Online communities can help you stay relevant as can learning from other customers. \n\n## 20:44 Management \n\n* Nick wasn’t sure what to expect here and had to get past the “walking into the principal’s office” feeling when a manager calls unexpectedly. \n\n* The management style is different than it was when Nick was in an operations role. \n\n* It’s been more like having a coach. \n\n* Listen to our [episode on effective 1-1s with your manager](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-012-effective-1-on-1-meetings-with-your-manager-and-gracefully-leaving-an-organziation/) \n\n* Managers can give feedback on things you don’t notice.   \n\n* John describes a manager as someone to guide you on your journey. \n\n* This was Nick’s first time to work for a manager in a different city.  Consistent 1-1s are key. \n\n* Still adjusting to the flexibility \n\n## 25:02 Skills Nick Wishes He Had Coming into the Role \n\n* Networking – not a routing and switching guy (despite the [NetworkNerd](https://community.spiceworks.com/people/networknerd) community name). \n\n* Containers – need to be deeper on this  \n\n* Presentations – do more of them, continue  \n\n* Had to ramp on industry-specific regulations \n\n* Is John moonlighting as a developer? \n\n* John cites presentation skills as something that needs to be well practiced.  You will be bad at it when you start. \n\n* Gearing the presentation for a specific audience is much like education.  The ability to pivot at any given moment is something to master. \n\n## 31:09 Getting Hired was not the First Time Nick Applied at VMware \n\n* Nick didn’t really know what a SE was for a long time or that it was a potential career path for someone in IT operations. \n\n* Nick cites the Geek Whisperers episodes about the Silicon Valley VMUG (listen to [this episode](http://geek-whisperers.com/2016/04/geek-whispering-at-the-silicon-valley-vmug-tues-apr-12/) first followed by [this episode](http://geek-whisperers.com/2016/04/investing-in-career-insurance-vmware-user-group-recap-episode-110/)).  Knowing the types of roles that exist as a logical next step from where you are is a helpful first step. \n\n* Nick’s VMware experience was extremely limited when he applied in 2016.  His experience grew considerably throughout 2017 after a job change at the end of 2016.  Using more of the technology, blogging, and speaking on the technology helped to build a [body of work](http://blog.thenetworknerd.com) someone else could use to evaluate Nick’s experience more than what is merely on a resume. \n\n## 35:46 Recommendations for others \n\n* Don’t sell yourself short.  See what jobs exist.   \n\n* Consider your relatable experience. \n\n* Start building a body of work today.  Use online / in-person communities to help you get there, and include these on your resume. \n\n* There is no chance to get a job to which you have not applied.  Reach out to peers who do the job you think you want to get their feedback on whether you are qualified.   \n\n* John beats Nick to the punch again! \n\n* [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the

Observations \n\n========================================================================================================== \n\n## 1:30 Topics Begin \n\n* How did John fare at Michael Jordan trivia since this is episode 23? \n\n* John and Nick have hire dates that are roughly 2 years apart. \n\n## 4:31 What Has John Learned? \n\n* 4:31 Core job functions \n\n* Reached competence in year 1 \n\n* Explaining the portfolio \n\n* Virtual desktop was a blind spot \n\n* Portfolio much larger than it once was \n\n* Understanding where these products have relevance to customer business problems \n\n* Coming up with a good company elevator pitch was important.  John gives the example of having to do this at a career fair. \n\n* Understanding customer business issues was new to John. \n\n* Building relationships within customer organizations and being relevant \n\n* How close does John see the role of the SE to the account representative? \n\n* We have to know where our solutions will definitely and when to rule them out based on the situation (first level technical qualification). \n\n* John supports two account reps. \n\n* An account rep will be focused on higher level relationships within the organization that a SE may not have. \n\n* 14:20 Extended job functions \n\n* Built up to competence in year two \n\n* Extending relationships with the VMware business units to product team members, technical support team members, etc. \n\n* Using large events like VMworld / others to build better relationships with customers \n\n* 18:16 Building an internal network / determining career trajectory \n\n* Competency in year three \n\n* Build stronger relationships with the partner ecosystem \n\n* John had to learn the value to the company from going through a partner / reseller. \n\n* Sometimes deals are better taken directly than through a reseller. \n\n* Partners may need to help with implementation or help customers manage support contracts.  John gives a nice example of when he leaned on a partner for help as a customer. \n\n* John cites participation in communities such as [Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/) as a way to get some information on how the ecosystem works. \n\n* Other organizations within the company like OCTO (Office of the CTO) \n\n* Relationships with tech marketing folks \n\n## 25:02 – What is the Job?  \n\n* 25:02 Customer focus \n\n* It's very important to understand what the customer does on a very basic level (their product, how they sell, what their value is in the market, who their competition is, how they view themselves, etc.). \n\n* Customers need to know you're willing to help before sharing certain information with you.  It comes down to the types of relationships one has within the organization. \n\n* Understanding customer organizational structure and how they measure success is important before proposing any solutions. \n\n* Overcoming internal challenges like politics and personnel takes time.   \n\n* John didn't see the big picture of making the organization / department successful as a customer and had to learn it after leaving the customer side.   \n\n* John had to learn who in the organization has purchased from us, the level of success they have experienced, and how the expanding portfolio is addressing the expanding organizational challenges. \n\n* There's an education element to this job as well.  If customers don't know our capabilities, we cannot help them. \n\n* Listen to what John shares about multiple IT groups existing within organizations and the variance he's seen across the board. \n\n* 43:59 Customer business problem focus \n\n* Executive Initiatives \n\n* Business Initiatives \n\n* Technology Initiatives \n\n* VMware Solutions \n\n* This required John to train his mind in a new way of thinking. \n\n* Check out [Episode 16](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-016-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-1-before-applying/) and [Episode 4](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-004-company-culture-and-resume-writing/) for our discussions of how managers may / may not understand the big picture and where your work / project fits into the goals an organization. \n\n* John feels like this problem is more common in smaller organizations. \n\n* Putting structure into an IT organization may not be prioritized. \n\n* 50:56 Product focus \n\n* The portfolio continues to advance and expand (acquisitions, etc.). \n\n* Be aware of new operating models such as cloud, edge, and managed. \n\n* We must keep up to date to stay relevant to customers. \n\n* 53:21 Personal development \n\n* Expanded knowledge of the marketplace \n\n* John must maintain relevance in areas that are relevant to customers (AWS / GCP / Azure, storage, networking, security, compute). \n\n* Check out [Episode 6](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-006-the-ins-and-outs-of-training-why-how-what-and-when) and [Episode

[[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode, we discuss John's 3 Year Check-in at VMware, Part 2. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 2019-2-2 \n\nTopics – John's 3 Year Check-in at VMware, Nick's Questions \n\n========================================================================================================== \n\n## 1:55 Topics Begin \n\n* Check out [part 1](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-023-johns-3-year-check-in-at-vmware-part-1/) of John's 3 Year check-in if you missed it last week. \n\n* John mentions sports research.  Was he prepared for what came next? \n\n## 2:54 What has Made John stay with the company? \n\n* John considered this a medium to long-term job once he joined.  \n\n* He loves the technology VMware has and the innovations as well as the overall technology space. \n\n* John has enjoyed exposure to new customer problems and situations (technical, political, etc.). \n\n* The constant change keeps it interesting. \n\n* Building good relationships with customers is part of the job and a nice perk. \n\n* The overall experience has been enjoyable.  John describes this as a process of continual improvement (always considering ways to get better), which has involved self-study as well as collaboration with others. \n\n* The goal is to always do the right thing for the customer to maintain a long-term good relationship, even if it means advising them not to buy something. \n\n* Everyone has more expertise than someone else and less than others.  John is a relative Yoda rather than an absolute Yoda \n\n## 10:32 Is John where he thought he might be after 3 years at the company? \n\n* John applied a number of times before getting into the company.  He had applied for a technical marketing role around the same time as applying for the SE role. \n\n* He had to sell the company on the fact that his career progression was not tied to a specific position or role.   \n\n* Mentoring was something he wanted – to be a mentor and to be mentored. \n\n* He's been able to be more active in social media, attend events, podcast, etc.   \n\n* A specific title was not part of the goal.  He focused more on the controllable steps to achieve what was needed to accomplish a promotion. \n\n* Nick's book recommendation – [Chasing Excellence](https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Excellence-Building-Fittest-Athletes/dp/1619617285) by [Ben Bergeron](https://benbergeron.com) \n\n* Check out our episode on [Process over Outcomes](http://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/) as well. \n\n* Figure out the process.  Do the things you can control.  If your measure of success is promotion to a specific title, you will be disappointed. \n\n* John has been iterating. \n\n* If there's nowhere for you to go at your current employer, you may not get recognized as you think you should be.  Maybe the goal should be to get a better job elsewhere.  Being excellent at what you do will always be in demand. \n\n## 21:45 Favorite memory from the time at VMware \n\n* John tells a story about being nerd famous. \n\n* Giving someone else a tour of the VMware Palo Alto campus for the first time was a great experience. \n\n## 24:42 How does John stay relevant while working for a vendor? \n\n* Relevance can be measured in different ways. \n\n* The ability to help customers solve problems over the long term is one way to measure it. \n\n* John also cites ramping on the growing product portfolio and knowing the value of each as another way to be relevant. \n\n* John cannot be a pure technical expert at everything, but he knows the right technical resources to engage when needed.  \n\n## 28:04 Does John missing being a customer? \n\n* He misses having 100% input and control over technology solution decisions.  It was easy to do as part of a small business, but there is probably not a job he can go into to get that level of control. \n\n* He's currently able to be an influencer at a number of different levels within multiple organizations. \n\n## 31:53 What's the least glamorous part of working for a vendor? \n\n* The nuts and bolts of the Sales process and being part of Sales meetings is not always 100% enjoyable.  \"Not every part of dinner is desert.\" \n\n* Knowledge of the Sales process can be valuable for anyone in an organization.  Check out [Episode 5](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-005-sales-skills-for-it-and-questionable-advice/) for more on this. \n\n* Nick had to learn about this after moving to the SE role. \n\n* [The IBM Sales process model](https://www-154.ibm.com/sales/salesconnect/olh/en_us/olh/prod/mysa/opportunity_management/opportunities/opportunity_basics.html) \n\n## 38:46 How has the amount of travel been since joining?  Do you have any travel tips? \n\n* Amount of travel is ultimately dependent upon the role.  Even for those with the same job title, the amount of travel is different. \n\n* John is flying about once per quarter and usually has to drive 3 days per week. \n\n* John's travel essentials: \n\n* Packing lists for everything (good way to lower stress) \n\n* Different lists for local vs. long distance travel \n\n* Nick pressures John to write a blog on this. Send us a Tweet if you want to see it happen! \n\n* Sign up for [GlobalEntry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry) if you are flying with any kind of frequency (includes [TSA Pre Check](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/how-do-i-apply-tsa-precheck)). \n\n* Sign up for travel rewards programs. \n\n* Dongle from [automatic.com](https://automatic.com/) to capture mileage \n\n* Capture expense receipts with your phone camera to avoid loss \n\n## 48:58 If this is your dream job, how do you determine what's next? \n\n* Should John become a full time career coach? \n\n* His dream for 5 years was to be a SE at VMware.  On day one of the job, he realized it was time to figure out a new dream. \n\n* John deconstructed what he enjoys doing: \n\n* Mentoring other SEs \n\n* Figuring out best practices across segments, specialties, etc. \n\n* Peer collaboration \n\n* More one-to-many conversations (i.e. outside of just his customers) \n\n* Speaking at [VMUGs](https://www.vmug.com) / conferences \n\n* Giving more presentations \n\n* John talked through the Principal program but mentioned he cannot just success / failover based on this alone. \n\n* These items lend themselves to a number of roles. \n\n* Figure out what he has time to work one, and see if other roles present themselves. \n\n## 55:47 Would you consider a move from generalist to specialist? \n\n* Nick cites examples like technical marketing for a specific product or SE specialist in a particular area. \n\n* John mentioned the challenge as a generalist to get deep enough in a specific product area. \n\n* He would probably need to be open to moving wherever the role is available (i.e. large concentration in his area). \n\n* He's keeping his eyes open but not committed to any specific path. \n\n## 58:40 When did you start co-hosting the [VMware Roundtable Communities Podcast](https://www.talkshoe.com/show/vmware-communities-roundtable)? \n\n* John started going to VMware meetup events and ran into [Eric Nielsen](https://twitter.com/ericnipro). \n\n* Eric was looking for a podcast co-host with experience in the field, and John fit the bill. \n\n* The opportunity presented itself because John went to meetups in the first place. \n\n* John had an idea for doing a podcast that eventually morphed into the Nerd Journey podcast. \n\n## 01:03:06 What's a lesson learned the hard way? \n\n* Not everyone is reasonable or sees the company as an important partner. \n\n* John has had some confrontational interactions.  It's challenging to not take this kind of thing personally. \n\n* You can only control your reactions to situations. \n\n## 01:05:14 How has work-life balance been over the years? \n\n* Nick was out of balance when he first started and still has spurts. \n\n* In some ways working from home has been incredibly freeing. \n\n* John says the most difficult thing has been managing how much he's working. \n\n* There is always something to do. \n\n* It takes time to get better at this? \n\n* Sometimes you have to choose to go to sleep and take care of yourself. \n\n## 01:08:28 What would make you leave the company tomorrow? \n\n* Ethical mismatch with what the company was doing \n\n* Cultural gap between expectations and reality (i.e. \"bro culture\", discriminatory culture, etc.) \n\n* Career issues \n\n* Not being valued / recognized as a good team member \n\n* Career dead end (builds up over time) / unable to progress \n\n* Family issues \n\n* None of these have ever been an issue. \n\nSee also [Episode 16](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-016-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-1-before-applying/) and [Episode 17](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-017-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-part-2-2-during-interviews-and-after-the-offer/) for reasons not to pursue an opportunity. \n\n* [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-25":{"title":"Episode 25","content":"\n# Episode 25\n\nWelcome to episode 25 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode, we discuss tips for adapting to a new manager. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 2019-02-07 \n\nTopics – Adapting to a New Manager (The Silver Episode) \n\n========================================================================================================== \n\n* Check out our [Nerd Journey Coffee Experiment video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6ScIUiNi14).  This was recorded while John was visiting Fort Worth, TX. \n\n## 2:50 Scenarios that could lead to working under a new manager \n\n* Scenario # 1: Current manager promoted / terminated / leaves the company \n\n* The new manager could come from within or come from outside the company. \n\n* Is John the manager killer? \n\n* It's possible you could take over as manager. \n\n* Scenario # 2: The reporting structure changes. \n\n* Nick shares an example of this happening multiple times at a previous employer. \n\n* It's possible you could work for someone who used to be your peer even though your role did not change. \n\n* Scenario # 3: Taking a new job at your current employer \n\n* It could be a new role under a different manager. \n\n* Scenario # 4: Taking a new job at a different company \n\n* New manager, new team, new culture to adjust to \n\n* Scenario # 5: Your manager leaves the company, and you follow the manager to a new company \n\n* This will require some adjustments regardless. \n\n* See Following Your Boss to a New Job [Part 1](https://www.manager-tools.com/2018/07/following-your-boss-new-job-part-1) and [Part 2](https://www.manager-tools.com/2018/07/following-your-boss-new-job-part-2) from [Manager Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com). \n\n## 9:18 How can you adapt to a manager change? \n\n* Keep being yourself. \n\n* You are in your position for a reason.   \n\n* Know yourself, and be honest about your capabilities. \n\n* Making big, sudden changes could affect job performance. \n\n* Get to know the new manager, and allow him / her to get to know you. \n\n* It's ok to talk about personal details to find a common interest. \n\n* Your proximity to the manager will determine how the first few interactions happen. \n\n* Managers need to get to know how you do things (processes, etc.). \n\n* Be positive, and have a helpful attitude. \n\n* Guard against letting fear poison everything. \n\n* If you are asked to change something, try to change it without fear. \n\n* Keep your previous ideas for improvement in mind, but don't expect things to change immediately. \n\n* It's ok to plant a seed for change, but use caution.  Listen to John's example. \n\n* This is a clean slate. \n\n* What if you loved / disliked the previous manager? \n\n* Be fair to the new manager, and don't compare him / her to the previous manager. \n\n* Acknowledge the change, and roll with it.  Give him / her an honest shot. \n\n* Listen to our scenario about change control processes to illustrate. \n\n* This is not a time to air all grievances. \n\n* Think about how you will be perceived if you focus on the negative. \n\n* Attach a metric if you're suggesting a change. \n\n* Looking for impactful inefficiencies is a nice place to start.  Maybe \"grievance\" isn't the right word. \n\n* Get to know the management style. \n\n* What are the expectations of you? \n\n* How does the manager measure success? \n\n* Relate your suggestions back to these metrics. \n\n* Is there a department vision? \n\n* What is the preferred method of communication with your manager? \n\n* This could be different based on the conversation that needs to happen. \n\n* Be clear about level of urgency when you approach your manager with a concern that needs action. \n\n* Avoid gossip about the manager. \n\n* Don't be that person. \n\n* Shut down complaining from others. \n\n* Differences in staying at the current employer vs. moving to a new employer \n\n* You're more likely to have good connections for intel on a new manager within your current employer (assuming the new manager was not an outside hire). \n\n* The interview process may be all you have for information gathering when moving to a new employer. \n\n* See our episodes on reasons not to pursue an opportunity [part1](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-016-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-1-before-applying/) and [part 2](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-017-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-part-2-2-during-interviews-and-after-the-offer/) for more on this. \n\n* Treat these tips as context-specific. \n\n* John's process for this situation \n\n* Change nothing at first.  Demonstrate the baseline of how you do your job to give a fair inspection of your work. \n\n* Interact with the manager, and explain the context of your process.  Ask for feedback.  \n\n* Over time, establish a new baseline of expectations. \n\n* Change things gradually to be sustainable. \n\n* Give the new manager a chance. \n\n* The goal is to make your manager look good so the department can contribute to the greater goals of the organization. \n\n* It's unreasonable to expect nothing to change over the course of your career.  Change is constant. \n\n* You can learn from anyone (good habits and bad habits). \n\n* You can control how you react to every situation. \n\n* Caffeination can help.  :) \n\n## Articles we used to help build the list \n\n* [Seven Keys to Adjusting to a New Boss](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2012/09/12/seven-keys-to-adjusting-to-a-new-boss/#3556498f8858) \n\n* [Moves Smart People Make When They Get a New Boss](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2017/05/24/3-moves-smart-people-make-when-they-get-a-new-boss/#73899e084018) \n\n* [6 Tips for Adjusting to a New Boss](https://theundercoverrecruiter.com/adjust-new-boss/) \n\n## The John White School of Mentoring is REAL! \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-26":{"title":"Episode 26","content":"\n# Episode 26\n\nWelcome to episode 26 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode, we discuss the generalist vs. specialist divide.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 2019-02-16 \n\nTopics – The Generalist vs. Specialist Divide \n\n========================================================================================================== \n\n* We're recording this in sickness because we're both under the weather this week.  This episode is brought to you by the letters [DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan) and [PE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylephrine). \n\n* How does John like the [NUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Unit_of_Computing) he purchased a while back? \n\n## 4:10 General Podcast Outline for This Episode \n\n## 4:51 What is a Generalist? \n\n* Someone with an exposure to working a number of different technologies (a \"jack / jill\" of all trades), likely not an expert in any specific area \n\n* Examples: Help Desk Technician, Systems Administrator \n\n* These examples require exposure to a number of areas, and the overarching reach of the role may prevent 400 – 500 level depth of knowledge. \n\n* Generalists may need an escalation point when something goes beyond their reach (i.e. a specialist). \n\n## 8:25 What is a Specialist? \n\n* Someone with a deep knowledge of a specific area under the IT umbrella (400 – 500 level knowledge) \n\n* Area of focus is a primary responsibility \n\n* Examples: Network Engineer, Database Administrator, .NET Developer \n\n* Does working for a vendor make someone a specialist? \n\n## 11:34 Can a generalist be a specialist? \n\n* Yes – it is likely a specialty for a generalist is deeper than the average generalist but not as deep as a dedicated specialist. \n\n* There is probably an overlap between the pure generalist and pure specialist (think Venn Diagram here). \n\n* Listen to John's examples of this from the Help Desk Technician role and Network Engineer role. \n\n* Specialties may be determined by the [Area of Destiny](http://nerd-journey.com/episode-020-reasons-to-quit-area-of-destiny-and-finding-your-area-of-destiny/) model we discussed in a previous episode. \n\n* Nick cites learning ERP system tricks from [Tom Delicati](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-013-the-sniper-approach-to-job-hunting-with-tom-delicati/) as his way of developing a specialty while working as a Systems Administrator. \n\n* A generalist working with specialist resources can help the generalist go deeper (i.e. working with support). \n\n* The industry in which you work and understanding business goals within that industry may be the specialty rather than a specific technology. \n\n## 21:47  Can a specialist be a generalist? \n\n* Yes – what if the specialty area is pretty broad?  Go back to the Network Engineer example. \n\n* Is being a specialist all about how you're perceived? \n\n* Are Nick and John VMware specialists?  You decide. \n\n## 26:04  Mythbusters, Nerd Journey Edition \n\n* Being a generalist gives you more opportunity and less risk than being a specialist. \n\n* There may be a corresponding lower compensation band for generalists because they are easier to find. \n\n* Many stay generalists to ensure exposure to many technologies. \n\n* Specialists need a broad range of knowledge in addition to just their specialty area.   \n\n* It is easier to move from generalist to specialist than the other way around. \n\n* Possibly, but this may be a perception problem.  It depends on the willingness of the individual to learn new things. \n\n* Check out episodes [6](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-006-the-ins-and-outs-of-training-why-how-what-and-when/) and [7](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-007-professional-networking-and-training-revisited/) on training and training adjacencies. \n\n* John weighs in on the risk of being a specialist. \n\n* Specialists make more money because of a unique skillset. \n\n* Money is about demand and the people with skills available to fill that demand. \n\n* Anything you have that rules out many others (i.e. a top secret clearance) is a potential reason for more pay. \n\n* Being a specialist limits exposure to new products and skills and narrows your viewpoint. \n\n* No matter what you do, by definition what you do narrows your focus. \n\n* Getting outside the bubble may require extra effort but is a must to stay industry relevant. \n\n## 43:10  Career tips for the generalist \n\n* Stay flexible, and put it time to stay relevant. \n\n* Be aware of what the branches of possibility are in your industry. \n\n* Choose a couple of areas that are of interest to dive deeper. \n\n* There is not enough time to be a specialist at everything.  You have to focus your interests. \n\n* It's a good position to be in if most everything is of some interest to you. \n\n## 48:17  Career tips for the specialist \n\n* Consider how general your area of specialty happens to be.  Go back to the Database Administrator example. \n\n* There is a generalist specialist divide within the specialty (i.e. possible ways to level up by becoming more specialized).  \n\n* What is it I am doing in the industry, and how important is it in the industry?  Finding areas where demand outstrips supply could be a smart option. \n\n* Adjacencies can be a logical next step.  John gives a great example for this one. \n\n* Learn something in a completely different discipline for fun.  Think Area of Destiny. \n\n* Take off the blinders of your company and your role as you look at the industry. \n\n* It sounds like we're encouraging everyone to be a full stack engineer.  Check out [Scott Lowe](https://blog.scottlowe.org/)'s [Full Stack Journey Podcast](https://packetpushers.net/series/full-stack-journey/) for practice tips on getting there. \n\n* Dive into something interesting in the least costly way possible rather than obsessing over the right tool. \n\n## [Contact

In today's episode we discuss organizational benefits of company meetings.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 03-06-2019 \n\nTopics – Organizational Benefits to a Company Kickoff \n\n================================================================ \n\n##  3:53 Why have a company meeting / kickoff? \n\n* It could be for an internal talent showcase.   \n\n* Take VMware's [RADIO]([https://www.vmware.com/radius/vmware-radio-amplifying-ideas-innovation/](https://www.vmware.com/radius/vmware-radio-amplifying-ideas-innovation/)) conference for example, which acts as a catalyst for innovation. \n\n* Getting great people together can inspire new innovation through collaboration. \n\n* The process of pitching an idea helps people formalize their own thoughts into a concrete advancement (i.e. new products or enhancements to existing products). \n\n* Company meetings can help communicate vision. \n\n* We heard top-level executives articulate goals for the company and their high-level strategy to achieve the goals. \n\n* We then heard regional leaders articulate their values and their strategic vision. \n\n* These discussions help the front line employees understand where we are going as a company and how to help the company get there. \n\n* Company meetings are an opportunity to communicate and educate employees on the technical vision. \n\n* In our case, the technical vision was communicated by a variety of classroom-style enablement sessions.  Having these sessions in person was a nice change from remote / recorded training. \n\n* John chose his enablement sessions with current \"big, hairy problems\" in mind.   \n\n* Nick had trouble imagining being tasked with coming up with the vision and strategy for an entire company / business unit.  This likely comes with a lot of pressure and a lot of work. \n\n* Company meetings can be a celebration of performance...and an incentive to perform. \n\n* We were able to see how the top achievers were celebrated. \n\n* This anchors in people's minds the desire to be top achievers and to set high goals. \n\n* We saw incentives declared for teams who achieve big, hairy goals. \n\n* A great mindset to have is...what can you learn from the top performers to improve yourself? \n\n* Company meetings can be a way to express and enforce company values. \n\n* Move from the statement of values to application of values. \n\n* In our case, it was interesting how often those values were mentioned. \n\n* In-person company meetings present an opportunity for informal networking. \n\n* Informal networks are powerful. \n\n* In a large organization, this is an opportunity for remote teams to come together. \n\n* This includes managers and could open some doors. \n\n* John has been interested in management as a career path and had the chance to interview people who have made the decision to be a people manager. \n\n* In small organizations, executives are more accessible and have more time to develop a personal relationship. \n\n* Getting everyone together promotes cross-collaboration.  Are there ways you could work with people from other teams to make processes better? \n\n* How much time did John and Nick spend networking this week? \n\n* John kept his eyes open for future podcast guests, of course. \n\n* John's tactics for networking \n\n* Introduce yourself to the people sitting around you in sessions. \n\n* Sit at a table of people you don't know and get to know them. \n\n* John ran into two podcast subscribers (out of our thousands of listeners)! \n\n* Nick targeted people he had worked with but never met in person. \n\n##  37:24  What about organizations that don't have in-person company meetings or don't have them at all?  What are they giving up? \n\n* We discussed the advantages of company meetings already. \n\n* John thinks the biggest disadvantage to not having a company meeting is lack of a clear vision for the company. \n\n* Asking about the vision is something to do in the interview process. \n\n* It might not seem troubling to sense a lack of vision if you haven't been somewhere that it is missing. \n\n* The company size does not matter.   \n\n* Vision and values need to be communicated to all employees.  How often do the values come up? \n\n* This podcast ended at 1:30 AM Pacific time!  Fortunately Nick drank coffee beforehand, and John was sipping Diet Coke. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-3":{"title":"Episode 3","content":"\n# Episode 3\n\nTopics \n\n1:48 -

In today's episode we discuss adapting to a new team.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 03-19-2019 \n\nTopics – Adapting to a New Team \n\n===================================== \n\n## 4:02 Joining a New Team at the Same Company \n\n* Your old position is going to be backfilled (taking a new opportunity) \n\n* Transition period \n\n* Who will carry your former responsibilities while someone new is hired? \n\n* This will likely be you for a time. \n\n* Who will train the new hire? \n\n* There's excellent documentation to train the new hire, right? \n\n* Some training may fall to you (i.e. new person will need guidance), but hopefully some of this falls on the team and the manager. \n\n* Hopefully there was some cross training, but it is highly likely you will have tribal knowledge of the role and responsibilities that is not captured anywhere. \n\n* Hopefully you got a raise by making the move.  See [episode 28](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-028-asking-for-more-money/) for tips on asking for more money. \n\n* You may already know new teammates.  Foster those relationships, but it is not appropriate to make an announcement about your role change.  Let the new manager do that. \n\n* Hopefully you leveraged potential future teammates to get information about the manager and the role as part of the interview process. \n\n* How will communication of the change to external customers / internal customers be handled?  \n\n* Someone has to be in charge of this transition. \n\n* John has transitioned on and off certain customers in his time at VMware. \n\n* A handoff meeting can be very helpful. \n\n* Who trains you in your new role, how will it be conducted, and when does it begin? \n\n* How do you fit this into new job responsibilities? \n\n* Hopefully you addressed this during the interview process for the new role.  If the company's training plan for this kind of change is not ideal, maybe it's time to rethink joining this new internal organization / team. \n\n* Post-transition \n\n* At this point, you are working with the new team and assuming full responsibility in the new role. \n\n* Meet / built rapport with new teammates \n\n* Proximity will determine the way you interact (in-person, phone, video, e-mail, etc.). \n\n* Listen to John's story about a great transition scenario and how he used that opportunity to learn as much as possible. \n\n* Reach out to other team members even if they do not reach out to you. \n\n* Your position is eliminated (still other opportunities within the same company \n\n* Try to check your attitude.   \n\n* Be logical, and prepare for every scenario (employment elsewhere is possible). \n\n* Be careful in the way you communicate the situation to co-workers / former teammates (not a grip session). \n\n* Leverage all the positive energy you can muster, and leverage connections to help you toward a new position (guidance, recommendations, etc.). \n\n## 23:18 Joining a New Company \n\n* During the interview process \n\n* Early / late exposure to future teammates, possibly not at all depending on the size of organization and what the process involves \n\n* If you are in the driver's seat (several offers, already have a job, not desperate to say yes, etc.) and no part of the process has involved talking with teammates, you should ask for it.  Use this time to understand team culture and how the manager operates. \n\n* If you ask for it and don't get it, what is the reason why? \n\n* After you start \n\n* Again, proximity will affect contact method, frequency of interaction to some extent \n\n* It's reasonable to ask to get to know teammates.  You're not asking to be friends but rather asking to be cordial.   \n\n* Ask others for help – processes, procedures, relationships, etc. \n\n* This is definitely applicable for the scenario of joining a new team at an existing company too. \n\n* Ask who teammates interact with the most inside and outside the organization. \n\n* How does your training begin?   \n\n* Do you have a dedicated mentor or a mix of training from various sources? \n\n## 31:23 Manager's Perspective of Being Promoted \n\n* The scenario we're considering here is a front line manager who has built a team from the ground up (hired everyone) and is given the opportunity to take a senior manager role (i.e. to become a manager of managers).  This requires hiring a new front line manager for the team, managing a new team, and much more. \n\n* Challenges in this scenario: \n\n* Leaving the team you built in someone else's care can be a challenging. \n\n* Interactions with the old team have to be different to give the new front line manager a chance to build rapport with the team. \n\n* Backing off from the former team members can be challenging. \n\n* Don't override the new front line manager's authority by giving skip level reports tasks. \n\n* Redirect skip level reports to the new front line manager. \n\n* The senior manager cannot show favoritism to the new front line manager for fear of upsetting the culture of the new team he / she is managing. \n\n* This thought exercise requires some empathy for the manager.  We don't often put ourselves in their shoes to attempt to understand their experiences. \n\n* A possible future topic for us would be to focus on the individual contributor who was promoted to people manager. \n\n* The senior manager likely has an all new team of peers, and it may feel like a completely different job. \n\n* This is an interesting chance to set the cultural expectations.  This plays into tactical translation of organizational goals.  Listen to last week's episode for more on that. \n\n* Does a manager who was promoted from individual contributor at the same company have an advantage over someone from the outside who was not? \n\n* This segment came from a conversation Nick had with a manager who had this experience. \n\n* John's suggestion – blow up the idea of people living through a reduction of force for a future podcast. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the

In today's episode we discuss scaling for a new endeavor.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-06-2019 \n\n* This episode is a natural extension of [Episode 30](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-030-adapting-to-a-new-team/) on adapting to a new team. \n\nTopics – Scaling for a New Endeavor \n\n===================================== \n\n## 2:11 Examples of Differences in Scale When Moving up / Moving on \n\n* Moving from a team of 4 to a team of 40 \n\n* A few remote offices to support vs. 20-30 \n\n* 2 Datacenters to 10 \n\n* 50 users to 5000 \n\n* Jack of all trades at a previous company but hired for new role as a specialist \n\n* Smaller companies might not have more opportunities for the highly skilled individual contributor. \n\n## 5:04 Intellectual / Technical Challenges \n\n* The level of knowledge is about the same, but the scale is different. \n\n* Examples – web server farm, DR plan per geographic location, geographically dispersed user base, large scale line of business applications, increase in applications to support, internal software development \n\n* Prepare ahead of time \n\n* How would the systems you're building scale to support future growth? \n\n* Thinking about the challenges / changes that scaling presents will expose gaps in knowledge. \n\n* Test environments / formalized test plans may be hard to come by in the SMB. \n\n* You may be joining a larger team. \n\n* This is an opportunity for collaboration since you may not be the sole owner of an application or area. \n\n* Peers may have some overlap in skills and responsibility for cross training purposes. \n\n* Change management may not be something present in smaller environments.  The approval chains for changes are important and could cause delays in implementing changes.   \n\n* Large organizations have to think about risk differently. \n\n* The guardrails (like change management) exist for a reason.  Try not to get frustrated. \n\n* Mistakes can cost more money in larger organizations. \n\n* Web-scale organizations think about risk differently than large enterprises.   \n\n* See [The SRE Handbook](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/embracing-risk/). \n\n* [The Cloudcast - Episode 392 - Real-World SRE Perspectives](https://www.thecloudcast.net/2019/03/real-world-sre-perspectives.html ) \n\n* See also [Datanauts Episode 89]([https://packetpushers.net/podcast/datanauts-089-sre-vs-cloud-native-vs-devops/](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/datanauts-089-sre-vs-cloud-native-vs-devops/)) for more information on SRE. \n\n* If you have an error budget and are under budget, it means you are not breaking things often enough. \n\n* [Tom Limoncelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Limoncelli) said \"if a process or procedure seems risky, do it often.\" \n\n* Nick gives an example of a system upgrade related to this. \n\n* Downtime has to be negotiated with the service or application owner.   \n\n* This goes along with a different style of application design.  John gives a nice example from Netflix and speaks to the [blue green deployment methodologies](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html). \n\n## 22:46 Emotional Challenges \n\n* These can pop up when you move from a smaller organization to a larger one. \n\n* The small fish in a big pond feeling is real. \n\n* A general feeling of discomfort can rattle people, but expect it to be there. \n\n* Things may be somewhat familiar but will also be new (new processes, political barriers, etc.). \n\n* The stakes of making mistakes are perceived to be higher. \n\n* Impostor syndrome can happen when you make this kind of change. \n\n* You may not be confident if you have not done this previously. \n\n* People are fearful of failure. \n\n* Expect to feel these emotions.  Knowing these may / will happen will help you prepare. \n\n## Advice to Push Past Challenges \n\n* 26:27 Overcoming intellectual and technical challenges \n\n* You already landed the job.  Someone believes in your ability to succeed based on existing skills or skills they can teach you. \n\n* Train yourself to think at scale. \n\n* See also [Episode 14 of the ExploreVM Podcast](http://www.explorevm.com/2017/10/explorevm-podcast-episode-14-making.html) and making the move to enterprise for some advice from [AJ Kuftic](https://twitter.com/ajkuftic) and [Paul Woodward Jr](https://twitter.com/ExploreVM). \n\n* We should have Paul and AJ on our show to do a follow up on this! \n\n* Read through reference architectures for different technologies.  Take [VMware Validated Designs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Validated-Design/index.html) as an example.  Reading these types of resources helps you understand design methodologies. \n\n* John finds these types of documents enthralling.  Do you? \n\n* Don't be afraid to contact the creator of the reference architecture if you have questions. \n\n* Reading through these can help with blind spots. \n\n* Remember to consider the people an implementation or major change impacts.  Include this considerations in a design. \n\n* 34:57 Overcoming emotional challenges \n\n* You got the job.  You deserve to be here. \n\n* Don't misrepresent yourself in the hiring process to set yourself up for success before taking the new role.  We assume you as our listener already knew this. \n\n* Acknowledge your feelings.  They are not wrong or bad.  They just are. \n\n* This was actual advice John gave Nick at one point. \n\n* \"I know I'm ok.  I just don't feel ok.\" \n\n* It takes time for the convergence of being ok and feeling ok. \n\n* There is a separation of intellectual reality and emotional reality.  Knowing you can do the job may not stop the emotions from happening. \n\n* You are not alone in feeling this way.   \n\n* Talk to people you trust about this (trusted friend or peer).   \n\n* John recommends speaking with someone outside the organization.  It could make other people uncomfortable with you if they know you feel uncomfortable and are also new.   \n\n* Having someone listen to what you have to say and echo it back can help you realize something you previously missed. \n\n* Professional networking is important to develop a support network for times like this (i.e. mentors). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-32":{"title":"Episode 32","content":"\n# Episode 32\n\nWelcome to episode 32 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss career paths in the first part of our discussion with Tony Reeves.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-15-2019 \n\nTopics – [Tony Reeves](https://twitter.com/importcarguy) of Gigacast on Career Path \n\n========================================================= \n\n## 02:37 – The Gigacast \n\n* Tony is the co-host of the Gigacast podcast \n\n* In 2017, [Britton Johnson](https://twitter.com/vcixnv?lang=en) approached him about starting a podcast. \n\n* They wanted to get more of the SMB voice out there.  There were too many enterprise scale products out there that did not apply to the SMB, and they wanted to talk through the products. \n\n* They eventually began expanding to add guests. \n\n* Be sure to subscribe on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gigacast/id1282241125), Google Play, or their [website](([http://gigacast.net/](http://gigacast.net/))). \n\n## 4:27 – Tony's Career Journey \n\n* Tony has always been a gadget guy, taking all the computer classes he could in middle school / high school. \n\n* He ended up repairing a friend's computer at one point and ended up starting his own PC repair business in Wisconsin. \n\n* After a technology hiatus, he worked for a telecommunications company on their help desk (in the [dial-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access) days).  He later moved over to DSL support and into the web hosting division. \n\n* John and Tony speak to the similarities between mechanics and PC builders. \n\n* Only John could work in the mention of an article about building your own AR-15 and relate it to PC building. \n\n* Wired:[THE AR-15 IS MORE THAN A GUN. IT'S A GADGET](https://www.wired.com/2013/02/ar-15/) \n\n* Tony used to work on cars for a living before getting involved in technology. \n\n* What is dirtier, working on cars or opening up old PCs?  Tony shares a story to help you decide. \n\n* John throws in another story about his Intel NUC.   \n\n* Tony left the job at the telecommunications company for personal reasons and moved to a customer service role at an outsourcer. \n\n* This company needed a new Network Technician and was encouraged to apply for the role by a peer.  Tony got the job.  \n\n* Tony's friend and peer ended up leaving the company after about a year for a Network Administrator role. \n\n* This friend was the one who told Tony about VMware (around 2008). \n\n* Tony stayed at this company for about 7 years and was involved in a number of projects, but it was apparent he would not be able to move up within the company without relocating to a major city.   \n\n* Tony wanted to get into servers and architecture and away from desktop support. \n\n* Tony then made the decision to get [certified on VMware technologies]([https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmware-certification-tracks-diagram.pdf](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmware-certification-tracks-diagram.pdf)), but the cost of classroom training was a barrier. \n\n* Someone he met encouraged him to sign up for the course through a local college at a discounted rate.  Tony felt people with certifications seemed to have a leg up when it came to interviews.  \n\n* Tony took the class (on-demand videos plus homework), invested in a home lab (started with a Dell R610), and achieved the certification in [Data Center Virtualization]([https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vcp-dcv-2019.html](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vcp-dcv-2019.html)). \n\n* At this point, Tony was targeting a role that allowed him to leverage his certification. \n\n* The employer where he landed was impressed with Tony's initiative to get the certification on his own. \n\n* Experience with home labs or even free virtual labs is something you should list on a resume.  Listen to John and Tony's ideas on demonstratable experience. \n\n* Because of Tony's lab experience, he was able to dive into the new role and perform very well. \n\n* He was unproven in a business environment, but someone took a chance on him. \n\n* Tony's boss handed off most all VMware work to him. \n\n* Tony mentioned the opportunities this role gave him to learn about storage, specifically [vSAN](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsan.html) as well as to develop relationships with people on the product team at VMware. \n\n## 30:09 – Conference Attendance as a Networking Tool \n\n* Tony talks about the effects of conferences and networking with others in the community on his career. \n\n* Conferences afforded the opportunity to learn from others and meet people close to vendor products. \n\n* He cited a shift in focus at conferences from attending sessions to networking with other users. \n\n* Tony has attended [VMworld]([https://www.vmworld.com/en/index.html](https://www.vmworld.com/en/index.html)) as well as [VeeamON]([https://www.veeam.com/veeamon](https://www.veeam.com/veeamon)) and mentioned meeting many of the same community members at both.   \n\n* Conversations began as very technical, but as the number of interactions increased, it was more like talking to others as friends and \"who is going where?\" \n\n* Going to conferences was a career accelerator. \n\n* Tony was an early adopter of vSAN and was encouraged to do a speaking session on it, which gained popularity.  He was asked to do the session at several [VMUG]([https://www.vmug.com/home](https://www.vmug.com/home)) meetings. \n\n* The more you step out of your comfort zone, the better you get at it. \n\n* Accept that the first time doing something will not be your best.  It takes practice. \n\n* After doing a number of events during this year of speaking engagements, Tony's employer was supportive of him continuing this trend.  They saw value in the contacts he had made and could leverage to help the business. \n\n* Tony was hired as a SE at VMware and starts on 4/22/2019, specializing in vSAN. \n\n## 41:34 – The Decision to Go for a SE Position \n\n* Tony had a conversation with his manager about career (the 5-year conversation). \n\n* \"Someday I want to work at VMware.\" \n\n* Tony's manager was very supportive to help him get there. \n\n* Tony had applied a number of times at VMware and was taking a break, but they sought him out about the vSAN SE role recently. \n\n* It was not a hard decision to go for it. \n\n* After taking the new job, Tony's management said they were not surprised that he got a job with a vendor. \n\n* Many of the things Tony was doing internally involved salesmanship. \n\n* He loved VMware as a company and its culture. \n\n* Tony had considered a Solution Architect role at one point but did not quite make it.  He also finds Technical Marketing as an interesting possibility. \n\n* John speaks to his realization about how to get projects funded happening after moving on to SE. \n\n* Should a manager have it as a badge of honor if the people under them improve to the point of having to leave the organization or take a larger role within the same organization? \n\n* Tony made sure to leave on good terms and turned over all relevant documentation to a trusted partner that would carry the weight after his departure. \n\n* Can a vendor employee give unbiased advice?  What does Tony have to say about it? \n\n* What are Tony's thoughts on giving up / maintaining technical relevance? \n\n* Tony weighs in on becoming a specialist after being a bit of a generalist as a customer. \n\n* Advice for walking a similar path... \n\n* Get involved with a mentor who has done it. \n\n* This person can be a sounding board, help you know where to get started, help you navigate community resources, etc. \n\n* Get involved in advocacy programs like the [vExpert program]([https://vexpert.vmware.com/](https://vexpert.vmware.com/)). \n\n* Go to a local user group for direction. \n\n* The community (or #vCommunity) has been essential in Tony's journey. \n\n* Tony mentioned [Twitter]([https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/)) has been extremely helpful. \n\n## Stay tuned for part 2 of the discussion next week! \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the

In today's episode we discuss user groups and advocacy groups in the second part of our conversation with Tony Reeves.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-15-2019 \n\nTopics – [Tony Reeves](https://twitter.com/importcarguy) of Gigacast on User Groups and Advocacy Groups \n\n================================================================================= \n\n## 02:03 User Group Involvement \n\n* Tony got involved in VMUG after a friend told him about VMware technologies in 2008.  It was interesting at the time but above his head. \n\n* After he got the job as a VMware administrator, he started attending VMUGs close to home.   \n\n* The community talks were so valuable he started wanting to visit VMUGs in other areas. \n\n* Just going to meetings gets you involved in the community. \n\n* Tony got to know the leadership of his local group and wanted to start giving back in other ways. \n\n* When one of the Wisconsin VMUG leaders got a job at VMware, Tony joined the steering committee and was eventually promoted to leader in October 2018. \n\n* As part of the steering committee, Tony was on weekly staff calls and helped find venues for meetings.  The time commitment was not as much as he thought. \n\n* Being a leader added additional planning responsibilities and required leadership training. \n\n* Tony speaks to the customer / vendor / VMware employee ratio on the steering committee and leadership group of a VMUG. \n\n## 12:07 Advocacy Groups \n\n* Tony first applied for the vExpert program at the end of 2016. \n\n* He was encouraged to apply by a mentor. \n\n* The applications are reviewed, and getting into the program is based on community contribution and participation. \n\n* Perks of the program involve free software licenses, sneak peaks at new products, and other special events. \n\n* Getting into the program is one thing.  Staying in is another.  You must maintain contributions (blogging podcasts, etc.). \n\n## 18:11 Blogging \n\n* Tony is also a [blogger]([https://www.digitalvspace.com/2019/03/to-mothership.html](https://www.digitalvspace.com/2019/03/to-mothership.html)). \n\n* He was recently recognized as the Favorite New Blog for 2018 on [vsphere-land.com]([http://vsphere-land.com/news/top-vblog-2018-full-results.html](http://vsphere-land.com/news/top-vblog-2018-full-results.html)). \n\n## 23:03 Podcasting \n\n* Tony weighs in on the effects of being on the Gigacast. \n\n* Once they shifted the format of the show to a guest format, it seemed to really take off. \n\n* Tony may not have been exposed to some of the topics if he did not have this chance to get outside the VMware bubble. \n\n* If you like the show, be sure to tell the guys who make it...and don't forget to ask for a sticker! \n\n## 26:58 Mentorship \n\n* You can contact [Tony](https://twitter.com/importcarguy) for help any time. \n\n* Tony gives John an on-air \"thank you\" for a previous mentoring session.   \n\n* \"Now it's your turn.\"  \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-34":{"title":"Episode 34","content":"\n# Episode 34\n\nWelcome to episode 34 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss career paths in the first part of our discussion with Jimmy Tassin.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-16-2019 \n\nTopics – Part 1 of Our Discussion with [Jimmy Tassin]([https://community.spiceworks.com/people/jimmy-t](https://community.spiceworks.com/people/jimmy-t)) \n\n========================================================= \n\n* Nick and John know Jimmy through the [Spiceworks community]([https://community.spiceworks.com](https://community.spiceworks.com/)), and Nick had the opportunity to meet Jimmy in person at [Spiceworld](https://www.spiceworks.com/spiceworld/). \n\n* Jimmy is currently the IT Director for a bank near St. Louis and has been with the company for about 5 years. \n\n* His focus is mostly on security, reporting, and keeping management happy. \n\n## 3:14 – Career History \n\n* Jimmy got into computers in middle school when Macs started showing up in classrooms.   \n\n* The librarian noticed he was savvy on the computer and solicited Jimmy's help with computer support. \n\n* Jimmy started taking computer classes in high school and ended up joining the Navy (worked with radar systems and combat control).  \n\n* After that he went to college and majored in computer science. \n\n* In high school he wanted to be a video game developer and at one point got into [DigiPen Academy](https://www.digipen.edu/). \n\n* He got a bachelor's and master's degree in 4 years. \n\n* Jimmy came to the realization in college that programming was not for him. \n\n* The life of a developer wasn't what he had originally thought. \n\n* To Jimmy, programming was solving a puzzle and very enjoyable.  But doing this 8-10 hours per day seemed like a road to burnout. \n\n* He worked tier 1 / tier 2 help desk for a health group while going to school. \n\n* Listen to his interview story and the perception of being \"dressed up.\"  Has this ever happened to you? \n\n* John gets on the soap box about company culture and appropriate dress.  See [Episode 9](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-009-blowing-an-interview-and-dressing-for-an-interview/) for more how to dress for an interview. \n\n* After a year, Jimmy switched to night classes and transitioned to full time with this employer. \n\n* His approach to the role was to learn everything he could while supporting a user base of 2500 people.   \n\n* See [Episode 31](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-031-scaling-for-a-new-endeavor/) on scaling for a new endeavor.   \n\n* Jimmy gives some great advice on making the jump from hobbyist to professional. \n\n* Jimmy's colleagues had experience he could draw from while he gained experience.  Google was also a great source of knowledge. \n\n* Many people in a help desk role got there because they enjoy helping people, but this role affords a great deal of problem solving opportunities. \n\n* The career path within the organization was unstructured.   \n\n* At one point Jimmy took on PBX administration with a Mitel system (because he was thrown into it by the boss) and later learned VOIP technologies on a Cisco system. \n\n* He was also responsible for all audio visual support for staff training meetings. \n\n* Jimmy volunteered to help with this effort and even led some staff training. \n\n* Jimmy wanted to learn networking, which seemed like the next logical step, but his boss did not see the value since they had a service provider handling it.   \n\n* At this point he decided to move on to a new employer (a credit union).  His ambition was greater than the role could provide. \n\n* Jimmy landed a new role at a credit union as a systems administrator. \n\n* He knew the title he was looking to land (systems / network administrator), making it very clear to this employer that he wanted to learn networking. \n\n* The job search was pretty short. \n\n* Despite not having experience in the banking industry, his relatable experience from healthcare (a regulated industry) was seen as valuable by this new employee. \n\n* This environment was much smaller than the last one, including changes to policies and procedures. \n\n* On Jimmy's first day, his manager was not at the office, but he had an interesting experience just getting to the point where he could use a computer. \n\n* Jimmy supported a number of technologies such as Active Directory and was given the chance to build an entirely new server infrastructure.   \n\n* Check out [the story]([https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/468591-a-server-upgrade-struggle-my-mount-everest](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/468591-a-server-upgrade-struggle-my-mount-everest)) he posted on Spiceworks about it. \n\n## 36:32 – Into the Spiceworks Community \n\n* Jimmy found community on Spiceworks and is still very active there. \n\n* It's a forum of IT pros of different backgrounds and experiences and a place to ask questions. \n\n* The credit union was using [Spiceworks' software]([https://www.spiceworks.com/downloads/](https://www.spiceworks.com/downloads/)) to run their help desk ticketing system and inventory. \n\n* He realized a little later there was a community aspect as well and started asking questions. \n\n* Jimmy also decided to share his experiences with the community. \n\n* Why did Jimmy choose not to pursue certifications after tackling some of his big projects? \n\n* Jimmy was the only one at his employer participating in the Spiceworks community. \n\n* Jimmy also started attending [SpiceCorps](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps) meetings in his area to network with others in the technology space, but his co-workers did not attend. \n\n* At a certain point, Jimmy transitioned from asking questions to answering questions in the community. \n\n* He decided to write up some formal Spotlight on IT Articles for Spiceworks: \n\n* [How Minecraft Made Me a Better IT

In today's episode we discuss how Minecraft influenced Jimmy Tassin's career in the second of our two part discussion.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-16-2019 \n\nTopics – Part 2 of Our Discussion with [Jimmy Tassin]([https://community.spiceworks.com/people/jimmy-t](https://community.spiceworks.com/people/jimmy-t)) - Minecraft and Relatable Experience \n\n========================================================= \n\nThe articles of Jimmy's we reference \n\n* [How Minecraft Made Me a Better IT Pro]([https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/462311-how-minecraft-made-me-a-better-it-pro](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/462311-how-minecraft-made-me-a-better-it-pro)) \n\n* [Why I Put Minecraft on My Resume: Crafting a Better IT Career Block by Block]([https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/569839-why-i-put-minecraft-on-my-resume-crafting-a-better-it-career-block-by-block](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/569839-why-i-put-minecraft-on-my-resume-crafting-a-better-it-career-block-by-block)) \n\n## 1:46 – Gaming Community Participation and Relatable Experience \n\n* Jimmy's articles in the Spiceworks community mentioned being a part of the Minecraft community. \n\n* He was first introduced into the [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/what-is-minecraft/) community while at his job with the healthcare company.  A co-worker got him hooked. \n\n* It's important to choose the right [Minecraft server](https://minecraft-server-list.com/). \n\n* Within a year, Jimmy transitioned from player to moderator to admin to co-owner of the Minecraft server. \n\n* After a Mincraft server was shut down, Jimmy and other co-owners launched [OmniKraft](http://omnikraft.net/). \n\n* From the beginning, administering the server was basically a full time job.  It was essentially like running his own company. \n\n* As soon as he got home from work, he would begin work on supporting the server.  This was 4-5 hours per day on average. \n\n* John points out what running a Minecraft server entails to clarify and why this is like running a business. \n\n* Jimmy had employees, had to manage expenses, do taxes, setting up the shop for players to spend money, figure out marketing, provided customer service, etc. \n\n* The average player age was probably 13. \n\n* Managing users was like herding kittens. \n\n* Almost everything for Minecraft was Linux-based to make hosting cheaper. \n\n* Finding a hosting provider, doing backups, and configuring firewall rules were all part of the administration. \n\n* At one point Jimmy's co-owner suggested they purchase a physical server and co-locate. \n\n* Jimmy realized this experience was translatable and could help his career. \n\n* During an interview with his current employer, Jimmy was able to provide evidence of his management experience to a C-level audience. \n\n* It's difficult to get a job in management with no experience.  Jimmy wrote the articles in Spiceworks to help others realize the experience may not come from your day job. \n\n* \"I was a gaming service provider / small business owner\" vs. \"I'm super into Minecraft\" \n\n* \"It's all the same stuff...just a different wrapping.\" \n\n* The Spiceworks articles received a lot of comments and replies. \n\n##23:22 – Putting Something Down to Pick Up Something Else \n\n* Jimmy eventually shut OmniKraft down after working on it for 4 years. \n\n* Jimmy was spending more time building environments than playing the game for enjoyment. \n\n* He offered to stay on during transition and let his staff take over. \n\n* He had hoped someone would continue the work. \n\n* There was a community aspect to Minecraft servers that Jimmy did not want people to lose. \n\n* They transitioned to [VentureKraft](https://www.venturekraft.net/home). \n\n* After stepping down, he could not bring himself to play Minecraft again. \n\n* How did Jimmy spend his time after laying this project down? \n\n* At first he wasn't sure what he would do. \n\n* After a couple of months, he spent time grounding himself from the experiences and trying not to get too emotional about it. \n\n* Part of the time was helping a new community get on its feet / transition over from OmniKraft. He did not want to disappear completely. \n\n* He hosted some events for the new server as well as some events for other games. \n\n* Jimmy eventually started a Discord group called [OmniGamers](https://discord.gg/Jvxp39C).   \n\n* The full transition history of OmniKraft to VentureKraft and then the birth of Omnigamers can be found [here]([https://omnikraft.net/](https://omnikraft.net/)). \n\n* Jimmy really got into the community aspect of gaming communities and couldn't leave it. \n\n* Jimmy has a talent for keeping things running that are important to him.   \n\n* Jimmy carried the torch and helped coordinate the [SpiceBuddy Program](http://www.spicebuddies.info/) for Spiceworld 2018 when the former coordinator went silent on the community. \n\n* \"Somebody needed to fill the shoes.  I have skills that can probably do it.  I'll just jump in and do it.\" \n\n* Jimmy won the [Spiceworks Champion]([https://community.spiceworks.com/field-guide/spicies-award](https://community.spiceworks.com/field-guide/spicies-award)) award in 2016 for his community contributions. \n\n* \"The things I do in the community...anyone else can do.  I just happen to be the one doing it.\" \n\n* Jimmy is more active in the security focused groups in the community these days. \n\n* Security has become a passing of his as a result of past experience. \n\n* How did Jimmy get started speaking at events? \n\n* It started when he was invited to be on a discussion panel at the [Spiceworld conference](https://www.spiceworks.com/spiceworld/). \n\n* The next year he did a full session that was very well received.  He has presented a session at each Spiceworld since then. \n\n* He was one of the first to give two different sessions at the same Spiceworld. \n\n* Some experience from the Navy involved being on a very large stage.  Listen to Jimmy's story on this. \n\n* Advice for career acceleration \n\n* If you're considering being a presenter, build on that.  Think about something you could talk about for an hour. \n\n* Think about questions to ask the audience. \n\n* Instead of thinking about being nervous before a presentation, think about being excited. \n\n* The presentation is about sharing things others do not know that can make them better. \n\n* As for career progression... \n\n* If you feel stuck with the traditional sense of progression, look for unorthodox ways.  Jimmy used Minecraft as well as participation in Spiceworks.  See what works for you. \n\n* What is the next role for Jimmy? \n\n* He's thinking a CIO or CIS role may suit him best. \n\n* Reach out to Jimmy on [Spiceworks]([https://community.spiceworks.com/people/jimmy-t](https://community.spiceworks.com/people/jimmy-t)), [LinkedIn]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtassin/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtassin/)), or even [Discord](omnigamers.net). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-36":{"title":"Episode 36","content":"\n# Episode 36\n\nWelcome to episode 36 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss the pros and cons of customer advocacy programs.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-23-2019 \n\n* This episode naturally follows our episodes with Tony Reeves. \n\n* [Tony Reeves Interview, Part 1](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-032-tony-reeves-part-1-career-path/) \n\n* [Tony Reeves Interview, Part 2](nerd-journey-033-tony-reeves-part-2-user-and-advocacy-groups) \n\nTopics – Customer Advocacy Programs \n\n===================================== \n\n## 2:43 What are customer advocacy programs and their benefits? \n\n* What are they, exactly? \n\n* The idea is a vendor has created a program that incentivizes customer to be highly engaged advocates of the solution. \n\n* This is not to be confused with customer advocate roles within a vendor. \n\n* This is part of the arm of a vendor's marketing organization. \n\n* John never thought of customer advocacy programs as advocacy programs. \n\n* What is the benefit to the vendor? \n\n* Customers become advocates for the product / solution. \n\n* The vendor is promoting and gets valuable thought leadership. \n\n* People are way more influenced by their peers than by any other avenue. \n\n* Social media widens the reach of the vendor. \n\n* Advocates can re-broadcast company content. \n\n* Vendors can get qualified feedback on things not working well as it relates to the product. \n\n* What are the benefits to the participant? \n\n* The participant's employer gets free marketing exposure out of it (speaking at conferences, etc.). \n\n* The employer has industry thought leadership because the participant is on staff. \n\n* Free software is often a benefit. \n\n* Access to technical vendor resources is more intimate to allow feedback / a greater influence on product features. \n\n* Special briefing programs / advanced information / beta program \n\n* Nick tells the story of beta testing [Arctic Wolf]([https://arcticwolf.com/](https://arcticwolf.com/)) and later becoming an early adopter. \n\n## 14:33 Downsides to Participation \n\n* Being a member of a vendor's customer advocacy program may be perceived as being biased by the vendor's technology vision. \n\n* Isn't making a recommendation to someone else about a product the same as being an advocate? \n\n* There may be a perceived pressure to contribute in the program. \n\n* Is feedback on products or a certain time commitment expected? \n\n* Lack of participation in some form will likely lead to not being part of the program in the future. \n\n* It's free sales and marketing for the vendor, and people may want to shy away from that. \n\n* John weighs in on IT professionals and popular opinions on interacting with sales and marketing organizations. \n\n* Are we (John and Nick) biased toward advocacy programs because we work for a vendor? \n\n## 19:34 Qualification Process and Popular Programs \n\n* Normally  people have to apply to be a part of the program and show evidence of technical prowess and participation in the proper areas. \n\n* Blogging, podcasting, and community participation (speaking engagement, online forums) are seen as helpful evidences.  [[Show Your Work]]\n\n* The designation of being part of the program is for a specific period of time and will require re-applying at a later time. \n\n* As your career changes, it may make sense to no longer participate in a specific advocacy program. \n\n* Popular Programs \n\n* [Cisco Champions](https://blogs.cisco.com/perspectives/cisco-champions-2019-applications-now-open) \n\n* [Cisco Cert Insiders](https://ciscocert.influitive.com/) \n\n* [VMware vExpert](https://vexpert.vmware.com/) \n\n* [Veeam Vanguard](https://www.veeam.com/vanguard.html) \n\n* [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/pages/what-it-takes-to-be-an-mvp) \n\n* One item that Microsoft wants as part of this program is code contribution. \n\n* [Nutanix](https://next.nutanix.com/blog-40/welcome-to-the-2019-nutanix-technology-champions-ntc-31459) \n\n* [MongoDB](https://upshotstories.com/stories/why-joining-mongodb-s-advocate-community-has-been-the-best-career-choice-of-my-life) \n\n* [Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/)!!!  \n\n* Local user-advocates were given the chance to speak to companies thinking about advertising inside the product. \n\n* John mentions [Influitive](https://influitive.com/), a vendor that helps companies create and develop advocacy programs. \n\n## 27:38 Career Benefits of Advocacy Programs [[Community Participation for Career Advancement]]\n\n* Use the program as you like.  The choice is yours. \n\n* There is a tight network of people in these advocacy programs, and this can be leveraged to broaden your network of peers. \n\n* Definitely put customer advocacy programs on your resume! \n\n* Designation as a technical expert from a vendor gives a different way for future employers to evaluate you (that can be verified). \n\n* Tinkering with free software for home use can help you learn skills to get to the next level (learning a new technology, moving into an adjacency, etc.). \n\n* The qualifications for advocacy programs act as a roadmap for furthering your career. \n\n* Even without the designation, the participation in community is key to advancement. \n\n* Are advocacy programs just for customers? \n\n* Vendor employees can take part in these programs depending on the vendor. \n\n* There may be separate advocacy programs just for employees separate and apart from the customer advocacy program. \n\n* Taking part in these programs as an insider can bring a fresh perspective to the organization. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the

In today's episode we discuss .   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-06-2019 \n\nTopics – Jon Hildebrand \n\n===================================== \n\n## 2:26 – Jon's Background and Career Journey, The Cerner Years \n\n* Today Jon is a Principal Technologist at [Cohesity]([https://www.cohesity.com/](https://www.cohesity.com/)) and is located in Kansas City. \n\n* He spent 14 years with a specific company and moved to a service provider for around 4 years before getting \"axed.\" \n\n* Jon realized early on that networking would be very important in his career.   \n\n* Jon was part of the IT staff at the college he attended and landed a job at [Cerner](https://www.cerner.com/) along with several classmates.  His first role was that of a consultant. \n\n* How is working with college professors similar to working with seasoned IT professionals?  List to Jon's take on that. \n\n* One of Jon's major projects was tackling a Citrix environment in the early 2000s.  This was a 6-year endeavor and required heavy travel. \n\n* Jon then moved over to managing internal systems (VMware and others) to broaden the technology focus. \n\n* By the time he was close to finishing up at Cerner, he was part of a 4-5 person team that managed 80,000 to 100,000 virtual machines and 2500 – 3000 hosts. \n\n* The scale of the environment required learning automation skills, and Jon started exploring [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) and [PowerCLI](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/PowerCLI/), drawing on a background in software engineering. \n\n* Jon speaks to his discontent with sitting in the middle.  He began to get involved in user groups like [VMUG](https://www.vmug.com/).   \n\n* He started to really enjoy presenting and realized he did not enjoy what he was doing at his day job. \n\n* Someone he knew from school let him know about a new opening at a service provider. \n\n## 12:46 - Moving to [LightEdge Solutions](https://www.lightedge.com/) \n\n* This role would expose Jon to learning networking, storage, and managing multiple global datacenters (not just a single datacenter). \n\n* He spent 4 years here and did some great work in process standardization. \n\n* Something as simple as building a server could change hands 8 times.  Jon was able to trim some of these processes like building a virtual machine down from weeks to just a few minutes. \n\n* The automation bug never really left Jon, and even now, he's still into PowerShell. \n\n* At Cerner he was hyper-focused on virtualization, but the role at LightEdge allowed him to touch and gain insight into other areas (or silos). \n\n* Jon speaks to other reasons for leaving Cerner in this light. \n\n* Jon transitioned to more of an architect than an engineer after being exposed to the pain points of the system as a whole. \n\n* One of the reasons this transition was easy for him to make was his ability to improve processes. \n\n* When you begin to analyze departmental silos, this is an analysis of environmental culture.  Jon speaks to the different mentalities on the organizational structure of technology departments. \n\n* John White weighs in on his experience with organizational structure. \n\n* Beware of \"that's how we've always done it\" in interviews. \n\n* What other red flags does Jon recommend you look for when interviewing? \n\n* Contact Jon Hildebrand on Twitter [@snoopj123](https://twitter.com/snoopj123). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-38":{"title":"Episode 38","content":"\n# Episode 38\n\nWelcome to episode 38 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we have part two of our interview with Jon Hildebrand, where we get to hear the story of his layoff and recovery from being laid off.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-06-2019 \n\nTopics – Jon Hildebrand Part 2 - Layoff and Recovery \n\n===================================== \n\n## 1:55 LightEdge Layoff \n\n* During year 4 at LightEdge, things were on the uptick like implementing new technologies, bringing in public cloud, etc. \n\n* Azure was a preferred partner, and they were looking heavily at [Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/).   \n\n* They also looked at network virtualization and other technologies specific to service providers that could add greater value / provide additional services to customers. \n\n* There were internal rumblings about acquiring another company. \n\n* Borrowing money for an endeavor like this often leads to trimming high salaried positions. \n\n* On the morning of April 16th, 2018 Jon was asked to come into his manager's office and was let go. \n\n* The experience was surreal.  He had heard of others experiencing this but had never experienced it himself. \n\n* They gave him no time to box anything up (told he could come do that in a week) to prevent others at the company from seeing what was happening. \n\n* Jon told his wife \"I guess I get to go look for a new job.\" \n\n* Jon was supposed to present at a VMUG UserCon in St. Louis the next day and no longer had a laptop to use.  He was more worried about this at the time than the fact that he had just lost his job. \n\n* There was a feeling of a weight being lifted off his shoulders. \n\n* During the last couple of years with LightEdge, Jon had been blogging and attended analyst type events like [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/). \n\n* Jon's manager encouraged him to attend these events as a personal benefit and a benefit to the organization. \n\n* While Jon was at these events, he realized there was something else he was looking for but couldn't specifically identify it. \n\n* Losing his job allowed him to focus on finding what he really wanted to do. \n\n* Jon's best job search advice is to expand the personal network.  Always be in communication with even the farthest fringes of your network. \n\n* He ran into end of fiscal quarters with different companies when applying. \n\n* Jon ran into Andrew Miller of [Rubrik]([https://www.rubrik.com/](https://www.rubrik.com/)) (at the time) and ended up starting the interview process with that company, but their timeline did not align with his. \n\n* One of the folks at Rubrik encouraged him to look at Cohesity as an option. \n\n* Jon found an open position for a Technical Marketer role and applied. \n\n* Howard Marks happened to drop Jon's name as a potential candidate for the same role. \n\n* Shortly thereafter, a whirlwind Friday consisting of 4 back-to-back interviews transpired.  Jon had an offer by the following Wednesday. \n\n* He did not know how much of a pay bump the job would offer, but it turned out to be around 33%. \n\n* The personal network helped him land that specific position. \n\n* In a roundabout way, starting his career as a consultant put Jon on the path to where he is now. \n\n* At the end of the day it is about education.  This role allows Jon to interact with the community in a number of ways. \n\n* He's been a presenter at Tech Field Day a few times now after having previously been a delegate. \n\n* Jon's manager was the reason he was content at LightEdge.  The level of commitment to Jon's development this manager showed was atypical and more like a mentor / leader, but it was a major contributor to his later success. \n\n* Words of wisdom from Jon's former manager - \"All of my best employees should quit on me at some point.\" \n\n* If you find a mentor who inspires you in this way, learn as much as you can. \n\n* Jon eventually needed the push out of the nest. \n\n* There is something to be said about being in a comfortable position. Jon felt like the last 18 months at LightEdge may have left him blinded by comfort.   \n\n* The outlet was going to tech events and getting involved in blogging. \n\n* \"It's almost like you're two different individuals, but I never see that person in the office.  I want you to marry those two individuals.\"    \n\n* It took a compelling event to eventually marry these. \n\n* The combination of technology and talking to people without being beholden to a sales pipeline is extremely enjoyable for Jon. \n\n* How did turning a hobby into a career turn out for Jon?  Does he still like it? \n\n## 32:08 Lessons Learned \n\n* Jon never would have imagined he would do something that required public speaking. \n\n* Getting challenged during your career tees you up to look for the next challenge. \n\n* Jon likes his challenges to be a little greater than they used to be. \n\n* First, he had to conquer the people problem.  From there, that exploded the personal network.  He had so many people tell him that, and then he lived it.  \n\n* It seems like Jon went through the Area of Destiny exercise mentioned in [Episode 20](http://nerd-journey.com/episode-020-reasons-to-quit-area-of-destiny-and-finding-your-area-of-destiny/). \n\n* What's next for Jon? \n\n* He's told himself a number of times he will never go into management.  If you don't feel like you can manage people, go and do it. \n\n* Think back to [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592). \n\n* \"The only thing holding yourself back is you.\" \n\n* Jon talks about being locked in the back of a truck with [Chris Colotti]([https://twitter.com/ccolotti](https://twitter.com/ccolotti)).  Should we do a follow up episode with both of them? \n\n* How could someone get into Technical Marketing? \n\n* Look into Tech Field Day events. \n\n* Can you write and articulate well in your blogs? \n\n* All you need is that one person to read it and say \"this is good stuff.  I agree with that.\" \n\n* Writing a first blog post is difficult for people, but you have to start somewhere. \n\n* Contact Jon Hildebrand on Twitter [@snoopj123](https://twitter.com/snoopj123). \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-39":{"title":"Episode 39","content":"\n# Episode 39\n\nWelcome to episode 39 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we chat with Paul Woodward Jr. and A.J. Kuftic about the transition from smaller organizations to the Enterprise.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-14-2019 \n\nThis podcast is a follow up to [Episode 14 of the ExploreVM Podcast]([http://www.explorevm.com/2017/10/explorevm-podcast-episode-14-making.html](http://www.explorevm.com/2017/10/explorevm-podcast-episode-14-making.html))on Making the Move to Enterprise. \n\nTopics – Paul Woodward Jr. aka [@ExploreVM](https://twitter.com/explorevm)  and [@AJKuftic](https://twitter.com/ajkuftic) on the transition to Enterprise \n\n===================================== \n\n## 2:43 – Background on the ExploreVM Podcast \n\n* Paul had been blogging for a couple of years and thought podcasting would be easier than writing.  Boy was he wrong about the level of effort involved! \n\n* Paul mentioned podcasting has been a great experience.  He wanted to give back to the community that helped him grow. \n\n* Paul has sound proofing foam in his office to make things sound better. \n\n* Changes in Paul's career trajectory due to starting the podcast... \n\n* Paul made the move from delivery engineer in the SMB to large business.  He's now a Pre-Sales Engineer for SHI. \n\n* His perception is the podcast has not hurt his career but feels like it has indirectly influenced it. \n\n* Paul mentioned people have been pretty open to being guests on his podcast, even in the early days.   \n\n* Some people were hesitant at first, but they eventually get over the fear, relax, and can have a great conversation (that the rest of the internet gets to hear). \n\n* It is not exactly the same as speaking to someone at a user group event or conference (i.e. think phone call vs. in-person interaction). \n\n* John speaks to the logistics and challenges of booking podcast guests. \n\n## 8:55 Paul's Experience with a Move to Enterprise \n\n* Each step has been interesting.   \n\n* Paul's first IT job was very siloed and was in identity and access management, but he's liking the MSP and the VAR world. \n\n* The challenges in smaller environment are different than those in larger environments.   \n\n* The best part for him through this process was continuing to evolve and learn, which was a direct result of making the moves. \n\n* Working at one company as a customer may not expose you to the same number of problems and different environments working for a MSP or VAR might.  Online community participation is also helpful to gain exposure to a wide variety of scenarios. \n\n## 11:58 – Silos and Interface Areas \n\n* A.J. got silo'd only when he moved to a large enterprise and has spent a large amount of time being a translator who could talk to multiple teams intelligently to promote wider systems level thinking. \n\n* For example, understanding public cloud requires knowledge of a number of areas. \n\n* Having the generalist mindset coming from SMB really helps build rapport with different teams. \n\n* If your Twitter timeline is excited about some new technology, give it 5 years before you'll see it in proper enterprise. \n\n* When these technologies get to large enterprise, there are more standards and best practices developed. \n\n* If you're comfortable in interface areas (where technologies interact), you can enhance your value to the company greatly. \n\n* This is where A.J. has made his career. \n\n* How can you shift with the industry so your skillset is not deprecated?  Listen to A.J's theories. \n\n* Is vendor lock in real or a myth? \n\n* It's ok to be wrong.  People have their own opinions.  Pick your battles, kids. \n\n* The architecture discussions happen in the interface areas. \n\n* In a small shop, you are the interface. As you move up, your ability to communicate ideas becomes crucial. \n\n* This comes back to people and processes and may have nothing to do with the technology itself – who will support, did we met design spec, etc. \n\n* Great quote from Paul - \"As much as we all love to play with technologies, our end goal is the success of the business, whether you think you are or not.  IT is a tool of the business.\" \n\n* People stuck in a silo don't see the big picture / overarching goals. \n\n* Paul's first stint in a help desk gave him a nice view of silos early on in his career. Then moved to a MSP and helped sell different technology stacks to upper-level decision makers. \n\n* Nice quote from A.J. - \"Just because you're not doing what they are talking about on LinkedIn does not mean you are wrong.\" \n\n* Sometimes asking why trips people up.  We talk through some examples of this related to companies moving to public cloud. \n\n* Make the changes you want incrementally. \n\n* Think about more than just where the bits are stored.  What is the business expecting me to deliver?  How does this change the way we will need to operate? \n\n* Are the goals of the silo the same as the goals of the business? \n\n* Go to market is different than go to function. \n\n* Architecture is about balancing what it is that you do (i.e. standards) with what the business needs and adapting as needed.  Be willing to allow changes to the standard if needed. \n\n* Sometimes you need a bigger engine, and sometimes you need a bigger fuel tank. \n\n* A one-off could turn into a new standard. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. ","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-4":{"title":"Episode 4","content":"\n# Episode 4\n\nTopics \n\n1:49 How does company culture affect your career choices? \n\n-   Disclaimer:  Our goal in this segment is not to be an infomercial for VMware.

In today's episode we chat with Paul Woodward Jr. and A.J. Kuftic about the Enterprise Architect mindset and career paths.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-14-2019 \n\nThis podcast is a follow up to [Episode 14 of the ExploreVM Podcast]([http://www.explorevm.com/2017/10/explorevm-podcast-episode-14-making.html](http://www.explorevm.com/2017/10/explorevm-podcast-episode-14-making.html)) on Making the Move to Enterprise. \n\n## 1:51 Business vs Technology Goals \n\n* John points out the difference in thinking about business metrics versus technology specifications. \n\n* Major software version changes can present a valid reason to make a change (i.e. to move away from a version that is no longer supported, move to a version that is more secure and decreases risk, etc.).   \n\n* Remember that software interoperability is important.  A change to one software may require a change to one or more other products. \n\n* Paul cites understanding the presence of change control as a difference when working with larger shops compared to smaller shops.   \n\n* He points out the organizations he works with as good at detecting risk and his role as an advisor to help mitigate the risk. \n\n* A.J. had to learn to talk with people about the reasons they want to make changes within the technology environment.   \n\n## 11:56 – The Enterprise Architect Mindset \n\n* Would it be more difficult for someone who started in enterprise IT working in a specific administration role to get into the architect mindset than someone who worked in the SMB who planned, implemented, and supported a specific technology? \n\n* It depends on the person and how much they want to make the shift.  Likely the person from SMB can make the transition easier. \n\n* It comes back to whether you can understand the questions being asked from the business side. \n\n* An administrator in a large enterprise who takes the time to be curious, interacts with personnel in other departments, and gets to the root of problems can move into the architect role.  \n\n* It can't always be fix and forget. \n\n* The person who started in enterprise has a better understanding of how an enterprise business operates than someone moving up from the SMB would regardless of technology exposure. \n\n* Some factors that determine success here have to do with organizational culture and adapting to it. \n\n* Give back to your team and to other teams in the organization.  Seek to interact with people on other teams in an intentional way. \n\n* If the organization is setup in an antagonistic way, it can affect your ability to succeed. \n\n* Culture doesn't come from a committee.  Changes to it come from the top. \n\n## 25:04 – Possible Career Paths for the Enterprise Architect \n\n* An architect from a customer may want to move to a partner to provide this role \"as a service.\" \n\n* Once you hit a certain peak within an organization, moving out into the consulting world can make a great deal of sense to gain exposure to other environments. \n\n* Another option is to work over to VP, Director, or CIO levels.  This change is more about how you manage people than how you manage technology.  Already being able to speak the business / solution language really helps. \n\n* A.J. recommends getting to know an architect to learn from him / her.  How is their thinking different from yours? \n\n* After being in the trenches, you can be the advocate for engineers and administrators to influence positive change. \n\n* Paul mentioned he is fighting to keeping his technical side after moving to pre-Sales. \n\n## Closing Thoughts \n\n* If you are a leader or an architect, it is advantageous to talk to colleagues about what they do and where they want to go. \n\n* Some people want to move up and do not know how, while others are content to stay in their cubby hole. \n\n* Make sure your people take time to train, go to conferences, and develop professionally.  This is vastly cheaper than hiring a new employee. \n\n* For example, services like [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) and [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/) are very inexpensive ways to get training on public cloud.  \n\n* Get out of your comfort zone. \n\n* Paul started working in a [factory and jumped into IT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qmdMyOYye4).  Take some risks by getting into areas in which you do not normally delve. \n\n* Take advantage of mentors, and do not be shy to mentor others. \n\n* Paul and A.J. have the best pitch for the John White School of Mentoring yet! \n\n* AJ's mic looked like a Deathstar!!! \n\nhttps://www.bluedesigns.com/products/snowball-ice/ \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-41":{"title":"Episode 41","content":"\n# Episode 41\n\nWelcome to episode 41 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss tips for constructing and giving presentations.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-25-2019 \n\nTopic – Presentations \n\n========================= \n\n## 2:56 Reasons People Present \n\n* Some people do it for the glory (i.e. to be nerd famous, get attention, etc.). \n\n* Educating or informing an audience is John’s favorite reason.  This requires people to be very good at digesting information and then present it to others in a way that they understand. \n\n* Maybe you’re making a pitch to sell a product, a  project, or an idea.   \n\n## 5:36 Stages on which presentations can happen \n\n* In person  \n\n* Internal training (1-many) \n\n* 1-1 meeting \n\n* User group \n\n* Conference (small or large) \n\n* The ability to interact will depend on the size of your audience. \n\n* Remote \n\n* Live – could be 1-1 or 1-many \n\n* Some interaction is possible but challenging with large groups \n\n* Recorded \n\n* Recorded live or solely recorded so others can watch later \n\n* No interaction between presenter and audience \n\n* The way to get started with public speaking is to get started regardless of the stage.  Start small and informal, and move to large and formal.  There is a progression to everything. \n\n## 8:43 Career benefits of presentations \n\n* Experience public speaking can be great preparation for a field facing role. \n\n* Giving a good presentation on a subject makes you stand out in a crowd and showcases your experience to others.  This type pf experience should definitely go on your resume! \n\n* If you have a skill that is difficult for most people (i.e. public speaking), it could give you an edge over other candidates. \n\n* Exposure to the greater technical or industry community can be helpful to anyone at any level \n\n* See [Seth Godin’s TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBIVlM435Zg) on ideas that spread. \n\n* This is an exercise in organizing your thoughts.  Can you organize the content so others can follow and learn from you? \n\n* A presentation can also be a learning exercise.  Trying to teach something to someone else can expose holes in your thinking and give you the chance to learn the subject matter at a deeper level.   \n\n* Communicating the subject matter well to the audience is part of your mission.  John cites a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWJCfOvochA) on explaining Quantum Theory in 5 levels of difficulty (mistakenly remembering it as Chaos Theory to a 5-year-old) as a great example of removing jargon from your thinking. Here's the entire [5 Levels playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLibNZv5Zd0dyCoQ6f4pdXUFnpAIlKgm3N) \n\n## 15:46 Presentation topic ideas \n\n* It should be something that interests you, even if you don’t know too much about it. \n\n* Something you have a strong opinion on can be a good topic. \n\n* You don’t have to be an expert.  Listen to Nick’s recruiting pitch to people at [SpiceCorps](https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps) meetings. \n\n* Realize that you have something valuable to share with others. \n\n* What would my audience want to hear?   \n\n* Fit your talk into the proper categories if submitting for a conference. \n\n* Many topics have been covered time and again.  Your take is unique to you. \n\n* The standard at a conference is usually 45 – 50 minutes.  User group talks could be 15 – 20 minutes.  Take a look at [vBrownBag’s Tech Talks](https://vbrownbag.com/category/vbrownbag-lolcategory/vbbtechtalks/) as a good example of shorter talks (12 and 27 minute slots). \n\n* Fit your talk into the appropriate time slot. \n\n## 19:05 Preparing to give the presentation \n\n* Know your audience.  Will the audience have some background in the subject matter area or none? \n\n* Ask user group leaders to get an idea of audience knowledge level \n\n* For internal trainings you may be conducting, talk to managers to get a feel for your audience. \n\n* Think through how you would do the presentation for different groups (technical, non-technical, managers, individual contributors). \n\n* Confirm the technical level of the audience when you give the presentation if possible, and be prepared to pivot. \n\n* Just thinking about the potential for a pivot will better prepare you.  How would you adjust what you planned to say about the different slides? \n\n* Lessons from [Brain Rules](http://www.brainrules.net/about-the-author) by John Medina \n\n* Get the audience’s attention using a hook (something emotionally stimulating) to make things easier to remember. \n\n* Giving an overview before getting into details helps our brains remember better. \n\n* [Peter Cohan's Great Demo!](http://www.secondderivative.com/books.html) book and training \n\n* John mentioned the [In Media Res](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_medias_res) technique from Peter Cohen as a good way to engage the audience. \n\n* Chunking the presentation into sections / stories is helpful to promote continued engagement.  John Medina uses a 10-minute chunk rule for lectures. \n\n* John mentioned [Presentation Zen](https://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Zen-Simple-Design-Delivery/dp/0321811984) by Garr Reynolds as a great resource.  See also [presentationzen.com](http://www.presentationzen.com). \n\n* Something surprising or unexpected can get people’s attention. \n\n* Using less words and more pictures makes it easier to remember.  Nick cites John’s presentation from a previous Spiceworld that had 3 slides, each with a picture. \n\n* Don’t fill presentation materials with the written version of what you are saying.  “If the slide has all the words you are about to say, why are you there?” \n\n* Too many words can indicate you are not prepared or that you need a better note system to prompt you. \n\n* Leaving out some information and making the audience interpolate what’s there can also help people remember. \n\n* Helping yourself remember \n\n* The context of your learning can help you recall information (the place, the mood you were in, the people you were around, etc.).  Use that to your advantage (i.e. giving the presentation in a similar place in practice to that of where it will be given for real). \n\n* Make an outline before adding details. \n\n* Exercise to stimulate your mind if you are stuck. \n\n* Check out [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/) as a helpful in-person resource for practicing public speaking. \n\n* Structuring a Presentation \n\n* Build in some time for questions in your presentation (i.e. at the end, in a specific section).  You probably won’t be able to answer every question asked. \n\n* Be prepared to take a conversation offline if it is only applicable to a few people in the audience. \n\n* Choose images that will help you remember your thoughts, but see if you can speak without a bunch of bullet points. \n\n* Learn about the [PechaKucha format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha) as an option.  Placing time restrictions on yourself is helpful to keep the presentation on track to meet its time slot requirements. \n\n* Ideally, the slides should not be able to stand alone (another Presentation Zen tip). \n\n* This is not always the case based on slide decks we see in the technology community. \n\n* The transfer of information should be via document, not the slide deck \n\n* Bullets are ok, but they should be brief. \n\n* What are you adding to what displays on the screen?  If the answer is nothing, why are you there? \n\n## 43:26 More on Practice \n\n* Practice as much as you can to get the structure and talking points right.   \n\n* Use friends / family / colleagues to get critical feedback during your practice. \n\n* Have people intentionally ask you questions to practice dealing with questions. \n\n* Don’t be a recovering “that guy” like John, but be sure to leverage him if you need practice dealing with this specific behavior. \n\n* Some people say just building a slide deck is enough preparation for them, but it may not be enough for you. \n\n##

In today's episode we talk to [Ethan Banks](https://twitter.com/ecbanks), co-founder of the [Packet Pushers](https://packetpushers.net/hosts/) technical podcast network about his early career path and journey to career self-awareness.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-28-2019 \n\nTopics – Ethan Banks and the Journey to Early Career Self-Awareness \n\n## 2:11 -  Ethan's Early Career Path \n\n* Ethan Banks is co-owner and operator of the Packet Pushers Network with Greg Farrow \n\n* Disclaimer: this interview kept Ethan up past his bedtime. \n\n* Ethan was in Network Operations before making the move to doing Packet Pushers full time. \n\n* His father gave him some helpful advice about “getting into computers” to go wherever he wanted, and Ethan ended up majoring in Computer Science (programming, algorithms, etc.).  The program basically prepped students to be developers. \n\n* Ethan gained experience as a classroom instructor and in the banking industry (electronic funds transfer, automated clearing house, bank teller) after college before going to Novell school. \n\n* He moved to a new area with his family but could not find openings in the banking industry. \n\n* Ethan saw an ad for Novell school which gave him a new career path. \n\n* The company that put on the Novell school also did consulting and hired Ethan part-time, which eventually led to being Microcomputer Support Specialist for the City of Manchester, New Hampshire. \n\n* Despite his background, he did not get to use his new knowledge and certification on the job as co-workers saw him as a threat.   \n\n* Ethan returned to consulting after a few months but left the City of Manchester job in a blaze of fire.  He wrote the employer a letter telling them exactly what he thought of the experience. \n\n* The work environment was not professional, but he did not handle the exit well as a young man.  \n\n* At one particular employer (a banking job before Novell school), Ethan’s manager cried in frustrated because of some of his actions.  He made an offhand comment to the wrong person and nearly got fired (to a VP, actually). \n\n* Ethan thought technical knowledge should trump all when it came to career advancement but quickly learned that was not the only requirement. [[Technical Prowess Doesn't Trump Emotional Intelligence]]\n\n* John mentions the [Dunning Krueger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) to describe this type of behavior. \n\n* People may not realize this until after being bitten a few times.  \n\n* Ethan speaks to the confidence element needed to be a consultant.   \n\n* While customer situations and problems may be similar, each one is unique in its own way. \n\n* Sometimes you may not know exactly what you’re doing but hope you have the ability to pull it off. \n\n## 19:16  - People Management and the Journey to Self-Awareness \n\n* As you work with enough people, the brakes get put on naturally. \n\n* Ethan had enough run-ins with managers who wanted to channel his energy in a different way than he was doing it. \n\n* Having kids also helped. \n\n* Ethan was hired as a manager for the New Hampshire government and was over employees with many years of experience and vast knowledge. \n\n* Ethan realized there was no way to know everything in that situation.  \n\n* Craig Benson wanted to turn state government into a big business and decided to consolidate IT across all state departments into one organization. \n\n* During the re-organization, Ethan’s role changed considerably.  \n\n* There was an opening for Network Operations Manager that Ethan thought he wanted.  An organization leader tried to explain what the job would be like, but Ethan insisted. \n\n* Ethan thought he was getting into a technical lead position, which is very different than being a manager. [[Managing People is a Different Skill Set Than Being an Individual Contributor]]\n\n* There was little technology involved.  It was a role full of meetings and coordination that Ethan hated. \n\n* This experience was like a second wake up call to what management really is. \n\n* Ethan worked in other management roles throughout his career as well. \n\n* If you love technology, fixing things, and designing systems (Ethan was that guy), don’t go into management.  It is a step removed from this kind of work. \n\n* John speaks to the potential to increase your salary by going into technology positions that do not require people management and our goal to do more shows on moving to people management. \n\n* Embrace the people management role.  Have a caring and compassion for people.  Understand the business and where people fit. \n\n* A manager is essentially a facilitator. \n\n* Listen to Ethan’s story about a former boss that put forth tremendous efforts to help an employee in some difficult personal situations.  “That’s a manager.” \n\n* Ethan had a different manager who was brought in to mend a broken relationship between the IT department and the business and ended up learning a ton from this individual. \n\n* As a young man, Ethan did not respect the management role but has grown to have a great deal of respect for people managers.   \n\n* If you think you can make the jump to people management, know that you will be learning and leveraging different skills.  This probably means you will be less technical than before, but it does not mean this is a bad thing. \n\n* Nick makes the point that employees likely do not know everything their managers do or what the responsibilities really involve.  \n\n## 38:01 -   Technical Career Path \n\n* Certifications were a differentiator for Ethan to advance technically (Novell, Cisco, etc.). \n\n* These were driven by his desire to understand more and have more responsibility. \n\n* Within an organization, a large pay raise may not be available without moving into a different position within the company or outside the company.  Part of the answer for Ethan was certification.   \n\n* Ethan took opportunities as they were given to him (like being a project lead, for example).   \n\n* These kinds of roles can be foundational for moving to Senior Engineer or Architect. \n\n* Most of the time Ethan was aggressively looking for the roles he wanted. \n\n* Ethan shares some examples of how large organizations are tiered for a variety of technical positions, which is quite different from SMBs. \n\n* Working with a consultant (regardless of where you are) is a great opportunity to learn about the job roles that exist.  But, it depends on the ambition of the people involved.  \n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-43":{"title":"Episode 43","content":"\n# Episode 43\n\nWelcome to episode 43 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we talk to [Ethan Banks](https://twitter.com/ecbanks), co-founder of the [Packet Pushers](https://packetpushers.net/hosts/) technical podcast network about becoming a podcaster and turning that hobby into a business.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-28-2019 \n\nTopics – Beginning to Podcast and Turning Hobby into Business \n\n##  1:47 – Getting into Podcasting \n\n* Podcasting for Ethan was an evolution of blogging.   \n\n* He started a CCIE blog in 2007 as a study guide while he was working through the certification. \n\n* There were not many networking podcasts out there, so Ethan thought it would be good topic.   \n\n* At the same time [Greg Farrow](https://etherealmind.com/) was looking to recruit writers for his blog.  Ethan didn't want to write but wanted someone to help host the podcast.  Coincidentally, Greg had been talking to someone named Dan Hughes about recording a podcast. \n\n* The trio started recording together as a result. \n\n* Ethan had done some audio work for the church he attended and even mixed an album for a friend of his.  He had enough experience to put a good product out the door from an audio standpoint. \n\n* Early on, Dan had to leave the podcast due to his role, leaving Ethan and Greg to move forward together. \n\n* Fun fact – Ethan took a brief break from co-hosting the podcast to take Divinity classes but decided it was not for him.  A friend that filled in for Ethan on the podcast stepped aside when Ethan was ready to return. \n\n* Managing work, blogging, and podcasting was brutal. \n\n* \"Committing to a weekly show means you need to have a show every week.\"   \n\n* Coordinating schedules with guests can be challenging. \n\n* Shows have to be recorded and then edited before released.  An edit can take time depending on how comfortable the guest is on the air. \n\n* Ethan had a long commute on top of all of this (more than 2 hours per day). \n\n* Ethan was doing contract blogs for extra money as well as maintaining personal blogs.   \n\n* The podcast numbers took off, taking the subscribers from hundreds to thousands.  They felt pressure to get good guests and good content to avoid disappointing listeners. \n\n* People may not consider the burden to listeners before starting something that has potential to be very successful. \n\n* Being married with children on top of all of this made for a VERY busy week. \n\n* Missing the cadence with a podcast has a different impact than missing the cadence with a blog. \n\n* People who like a show like it because they bond to the personality of the hosts.  It's more personal than writing.  \"People feel like they know you.\" \n\n* Ethan gives the example of [Network Break](https://packetpushers.net/the-network-break/) missing its scheduled release and the impact. \n\n* Check out the [Heavy Networking Weekly Show # 200](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/show-200-state-pushers/) Ethan references. \n\n* In this episode, Greg and Ethan had an open conversation about the struggle to keep up what they were doing. \n\n* This resulted in community feedback telling Greg and Ethan how valuable their content has been to others. \n\n* There are many podcasts out there.  Once you lose a listener, likely they will not come back. \n\n* It's difficult to commit the time to something that does not come out regularly and predictably. \n\n* Ethan uses these same criteria when he's selecting a podcast for listening. \n\n* Show length can also impact the audience's willingness to listen.  Over an hour may be too long. \n\n## 21:56 – Turning a Hobby into a Business \n\n* Most of Ethan's work identity had come from being a hot shot Network Engineer. \n\n* IT Operations can wear down a person over the years. \n\n* Ethan speaks to the logistics of technical side gigs, the time demands of being on call, and always being prepared to fix a problem for a customer (even if it interrupts family time). \n\n* Ethan needed to narrow down the things on his plate to one thing. \n\n* He remembers sitting at his desk one day and physically locking up because he had reached his breaking point.  It was like a wake up call. \n\n* Money was a big factor.  Finances have to be in order to go out on your own.   \n\n* Ethan pumped nearly everything he had made from extra endeavors into his mortgage, which greatly reduced the risks of starting a business. \n\n* He had previously turned down the chance to start his own consulting firm due to financial situation. \n\n* Ethan's employer (a medical startup) would not fund internal projects, and he was unhappy. \n\n* At the same time, Greg was ready to make a move as well.  Their motivations were enough to pour all of their energies into Packet Pushers. \n\n* \"It needed us to pay attention to it full time.\" \n\n* John thinks we're about to wrap up, but there' more...on lessons learned \n\n* Ethan thinks maybe he should have taken a shot at being a business owner sooner.  It's possible he could have been bought out by a larger company.  But he chose to be conservative. \n\n* He should have gone for the CCIE sooner.  The intimidation got to him. \n\n* Ethan wishes they would have figured out pricing faster when they started Packet Pushers. \n\n* Being risk averse has benefits too.  No fund raising or investors were needed to start the business (which is debt free). \n\n* How does Ethan keep Packet Pushers fun? \n\n* He still enjoys writing and podcasting, especially script writing, as well as talking to people and researching.  There is no lack of challenges. \n\n* Breaking down complex topics in a way people can understand is not so much fun as something Ethan really enjoys that doesn't seem to get boring after doing it for 10 years.   \n\n* Some of the administrative tasks of running a business just aren't fun (nor will they ever be).  The core of the job makes up for the operational drag. \n\n* As an owner, you are legally on the hook to make sure things are done right. \n\n* Ethan loves talking to people and enjoys having people on the show who have never previously been on it.  He emphasizes that everyone has a story to share. \n\n* Ethan taught Cisco classes at one point and was a school teacher for a year.  The education background factors into his current role as well. \n\n* What is John White's superpower? \n\n* Look up the [Dunning-Kruger Effect]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)) \n\n* How do people engage Ethan? \n\n* Send an e-mail to [ethan@packetpushers.net](mailto:ethan@packetpushers.net) to pitch a podcast topic, or use the [Contact Page](https://packetpushers.net/contact/) on the Packet Pushers site.  Cloud, security, networking, and other technical backgrounds are welcome. \n\n* Be sure to communicate the core idea of the reason for your episode (i.e. a story worth telling). \n\n* Final Thoughts... \n\n* Pick your battles carefully.  Do a few things well. \n\n* Learn to say no.  When you say yes to everything, it is tough to excel in anything. \n\n* Choose the opportunities that align with your own goals and priorities. \n\n* If there is too much on the list, work in a linear fashion to complete things one at a time. \n\n* Control social media usage.  Understand what it is good for, and know it is not conducive to finishing tasks. \n\n* Money is not as important as everyone says.  Once you reach a certain point, more money will not move the needle. \n\n* Family comes first.  Do not sacrifice family for career success. \n\n* You are a machine that needs regular maintenance.  Don't neglect your physical health.  Peak physical health affects mental ability to perform. \n\n* Get sleep.  It makes a difference. \n\n* More Fun Stuff \n\n* John's book recommendation – [Getting Things Done by David Allen](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/) \n\n* Ethan's favorite podcasts \n\n* [Heavy Networking](https://packetpushers.net/series/weekly-show/) \n\n*

Blogging](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/datanauts-061-trials-tribulations-technical-blogging/). \n\n* John recommends a subscription to the Packet Pushers Fat Pipe. \n\n* All subscription feeds

In today's episode we discuss the one year anniversary of our podcast launch, a review of topics we have covered, and where we plan to go from here. \n\n* Check out [Nick's one year reflection

reflection post](http://vJourneyman.com/one-year-of-podcasting-the-nerd-journey-podcast) for his additional thoughts on the origins and evolution of the podcast. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-01-2019 \n\n# Topics – The First Anniversary Review \n\n## 1:33 – One Year Since Launch! \n\n* Did you notice the change to the intro? \n\n* Reflecting on the launch \n\n* John tells the story of how the podcast came to fruition and how it morphed into having a career-centric focus.  \n\n* This was an attempt to give advice and speak to some of the things we heard others in the industry saying about the need to progress but feeling like they have reached a dead end. \n\n* Until we stepped out of IT operations, neither of us understood all career path options for those in IT operations. \n\n* As   John says, when you start doing something, you will definitely be bad at it.  We decided to just start podcasting.  Listen to how many episodes we needed for practice before releasing. \n\n* Can you find the episode Nick mentioned having \"release candidate\" mentioned in the intro? \n\n* The opening has evolved from its humble beginnings.  John discusses specific changes and the reasons for them. \n\n* Fun Facts  \n\n* The Nerd Journey logo was created by Nick's wife.  What two cities form the skyline in our logo?  Tweet us the answer for a chance to be on the show! \n\n* The intro and transition music was created by John's wife (who happens to be a musician).   \n\n* In the beginning, we had some concerns. \n\n* Could we sustain a weekly cadence?   \n\n* John went to local podcast meetup groups for ideas on this.  Would it have been best to release a season at a time? \n\n* Many of our ideas were the result of life experience and continuing to doing the podcast regularly. \n\n## 13:56 Episode Retrospectives \n\n* Our most popular episodes by topic \n\n* Interview topics seemed to resonate with listeners. \n\n* The generalist / specialist episode

Reeves \n\n* Interviews \n\n* The first 12 episodes were just us talking. \n\n* Preparation for recording was very different when guests were involved. \n\n## 33:15 – Lessons Learned \n\n* Nick \n\n* Carrying a topic on the air is more challenging than he thought.  Preparation is required, and it can't be all improvisation. \n\n* Being on the podcast has been like taking a master's program in the evenings. \n\n* Nick is always on the lookout to promote the podcast to different groups and in different circles. \n\n* John (#shallowjohn) \n\n* Organization and preparation really does help.  The vast majority of our time is spent coming up with the ideas (brainstorming) and then developing a structure around it. \n\n* The idea that we could do this on the fly was squashed. \n\n* Being accountable to someone else was helpful to keep things on track. \n\n* The process and practice of interviewing people is different than John thought it would be. \n\n* The nitty gritty of producing a podcast (engineering, editing, etc.) was new to us. \n\n* There is an endless hole of audio engineering one could pursue, but we went for \"good enough.\" \n\n## 38:33 - Proposed Topic Report Card \n\n* Potential future topics we mentioned in previous episodes...did we cover them? \n\n* Preparing for your next role \n\n* This one is pretty constant throughout the episodes. \n\n* Getting into blogging \n\n* [Episode 8](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-008-learn-linkedin-from-mba-students-and-thought-leadership/) on raising your impact radius \n\n* We have not done anything specific to how to start a blog, but maybe we could in the future? \n\n* Strategies for using PTO \n\n* Not yet covered but mentioned in [Episode 4](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-004-company-culture-and-resume-writing/) \n\n* Developing the people under you \n\n* Not yet covered but mentioned in [Episode

7](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-007-professional-networking-and-training-revisited/) \n\n* His VCP is now valid again per VMware's new certification policy.  John is looking more at the design track as a possible future path (i.e. VCAP). \n\n* Goal of having a professional network \n\n* Mentioned in [Episode 8](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-008-learn-linkedin-from-mba-students-and-thought-leadership/) \n\n* Covered in [Episode

45\n\nWelcome to episode 45 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss how to prepare for a career conversation with your manager.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-29-2019 \n\nTopic – Preparing for a Career Conversation with Your Manager \n\n============================================================== \n\n## 1:03 – The Genesis of This Idea \n\n* We touched on the idea of a career 1-1 with your manager in [Episode 12](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-012-effective-1-on-1-meetings-with-your-manager-and-gracefully-leaving-an-organziation/). \n\n* Nick recently needed to prepare for this type of conversation and thought he and John should share the methodology. \n\n## 2:48 – If You're not Having Career Conversations... \n\n* Not everyone has a regular career check-in with their manager.  Some people may not even have regular 1-1 meetings. \n\n* Why not? \n\n* Is this a cultural aspect of the organization you're in within the company or the company itself? \n\n* Is it the size of the company or related to your manager having too many direct reports? \n\n* Is your manager ineffective, or is it possible that he / she has an ineffective manager? \n\n* Make a guess as to why this may not be happening for you. \n\n*  Can you start? \n\n* Are there any barriers?  Do you have a good relationship with your manager? \n\n* Ask to have career added to the agenda of normal 1-1s as a starting point.  If that goes well, you can branch out to asking for dedicated career discussions. \n\n* What if there are barriers? \n\n* Aside from making the ask feeling awkward, you may be butting up against a cultural norm that does not support career conversations. \n\n* If you are not comfortable enough with your manager to ask the question, it may indicate an issue between you and your manager (something to explore and figure out). \n\n* If you cannot ask, knowing why is at least helpful. \n\n* If it's not ok to have these conversations, can you accept it? \n\n* You may not need to have these specifically with your manager.  Perhaps outside peers and mentors would be a better option. \n\n* Is this something you actually need, is it a priority, and is this the right organization / department for you (might not be that the company is not right)? \n\n* John asked about the aspects of career conversations before taking his current job.  Be sure to ask what career conversations / career progression looks like within the company during the interview process if this is important to you. \n\n* If changes occur within the company / organization and career conversations no longer happen, maybe it is time to make a change (job or company). \n\n* Are you interested in stimulating positive organizational change? \n\n* This takes time, effort, and political capital to do. \n\n* Get advice from others for help (inside or outside the company).  Not everything that happens is a reason to change jobs. \n\n## 12:02 – Preparing to Have the Conversation \n\n* Think about where you want to be in the next 2 – 5 years.   \n\n* Nick didn't think much about this after landing his current job, while John had thought about it during the interview process.   \n\n* It requires dedicated brainstorming time outside of the normal daily / weekly set of tasks.  Get out of the tactical mindset for a bit and think strategically. \n\n* What do you like about what you currently do? \n\n* What do you wish was different? \n\n* People you work with \n\n* Tasks / responsibilities \n\n* Travel requirements \n\n* Is your skillset and personality still a match for the role you are in? \n\n* Are you performing well?  You should have some idea based on manager feedback. \n\n* Do you have a kudos folder?  Maybe you should create one. \n\n* What do you see yourself doing next? \n\n* If you are not sure, check out [Episode 20](http://nerd-journey.com/episode-020-reasons-to-quit-area-of-destiny-and-finding-your-area-of-destiny/) on area of destiny as a starting point. \n\n* Think about how to approach the discussion with your manager. \n\n* John's advice on progression discussions are to focus on providing more value and not about moving on to a job at another company. \n\n* We're talking about value to the company, the team, and the role. \n\n* This naturally leads to progression (higher title, team lead, etc.). \n\n* What about adjacencies to your current role? \n\n* See [Episode 7](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-007-professional-networking-and-training-revisited/) or [Episode 26](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-026-generalist-specialist-divide/) to cover the concept of adjacencies. \n\n* Is there a logical adjacency to your current role that would be a good fit for you? \n\n* This may depend on company size. \n\n* Small companies may not be able to provide a technical adjacency, but moving into other non-technical areas could be an option. \n\n* Larger companies often have an internal job site to check.  \n\n* Keep in mind a change within the company could lead to a [new manager](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-025-adapting-to-a-new-manager/) or a [new team](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-030-adapting-to-a-new-team/).  \n\n* There is also the [Tom Delicati](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-013-the-sniper-approach-to-job-hunting-with-tom-delicati/) approach to creating a role for yourself.  \n\n* What do other people (your manager, your team) see you doing next? \n\n* Peer feedback can be helpful, but informal feedback may be best. \n\n* Consider people on other teams within the company that interact with you as well as others outside the company. \n\n* Should John and Nick go into full time podcasting like [Ethan Banks](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-043-ethan-banks-on-podcasting-and-turning-a-hobby-into-the-packet-pushers/) did? \n\n##  24:21 – The Actual Discussion \n\n* What if there are no moves for you to make internally as a next step? \n\n* Think about alternatives – senior title, team lead / mentor, escalation point for certain tasks, etc. \n\n* Ask for specific projects of interest to keep you engaged.  Look at these through the lens of what you want to be doing next. \n\n* Maybe additional training and development is on the table to keep you engaged. \n\n* The longer we are in an organization, the more we know about what progression can look like. \n\n* If you have outgrown the organization (i.e. no options here are available), maybe it's time to part ways with your current company (with a plan, of course). \n\n* Sometimes side projects are helpful to build skills – blogging, podcasting, consulting, training, conference attendance. \n\n* These are especially helpful when targeting a new organization. \n\n* Think back to the Jon Hildebrand episodes and how his manager had a unique perspective on John's career. \n\n* [Episode 37](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-037-jon-hildebrand-and-the-journey-to-architectural-thinking/) \n\n* [Episode 38](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-038-jon-hildebrand-and-recovering-from-a-layoff/) \n\n* How can your manager help you get to a new role? \n\n* Your manager can be a broker to upper management and other business units. \n\n* He / she should have feedback on your strengths and weaknesses and how those might need to change to get to a new role. \n\n* Your manager will likely know if other internal opportunities are available. \n\n* The manager could help you recognize some skills gaps / blind spots. \n\n* He / she could help validate your philosophical position on growth, development, and progression. \n\n* A manager has more insight into political realities of the organization (i.e. might not be raises this year). \n\n* The manager can tell you if you are being realistic in your aspirations. \n\n* Be careful discussing roles that involve leaving the team.   \n\n* This can come off as \"I don't want to work for you.\"  Don't be that person. \n\n* How can the manager help you \n\n## 34:22 - After the Meeting \n\n* What do you do when it's over? \n\n* Leave with agreed upon goals.   \n\n* Hopefully there is a career cadence to follow up on action items both you and your manager will complete before the next meeting. \n\n* Maybe the manager will be on the lookout for opportunities that would suit you well. \n\n* Just as you went into the meeting with an agenda, come out with one too. \n\n* How do you follow through \n\n* Execute on action items. \n\n* Practice chunking and developing milestones.   \n\n* Check in regularly (don't have to wait for next cadence meeting to inform the manager that something is complete). \n\n* Keep the cadence to ensure the discussions continue. \n\n* Talk to your peers.  Are they having career conversations?  What are those like? \n\n* Consider folks on the same team, different teams, and even some outside the company. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the

In today's episode we discuss Keiran Shelden's battle with career advancement in the first of two episodes with him.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-05-2019 \n\nThis discussion is partly a follow up to Keiran's blog on [You, Your Health, and the Datacenter]([https://readysetvirtual.wordpress.com/2017/12/08/you-your-health-and-the-datacenter/](https://readysetvirtual.wordpress.com/2017/12/08/you-your-health-and-the-datacenter/)). \n\nTopic – Keiran Shelden, Career Advancement, and Unexpected Feedback \n\n=================================================================== \n\n## 3:15 - Career Journey \n\n* This episode gets off to a rocket start based on Keiran's first comment!  He is our first international guest on the show and definitely a humble guy. \n\n* Keiran started playing with computers at 9 or 10 and eventually did computer support for his school here and there. \n\n* In high school, had the opportunity to do a coop program that gave him experience in the workplace. \n\n* This is an optional extracurricular type of activity in Austrailia. \n\n* School is an option, but the school based training that Keiran did is an option as well.  It involves a day out of school (which students have to make up) that students use to immerse in a real work environment (industry of your choice). \n\n* He chose to work in the IT industry through this program. \n\n* After finishing school, he worked at a computer store.  Customers fom the store recommended him for a new job, and a manager came in to interview Kieran on the spot. \n\n* Kieran took a new role based on that interview managing technology for a high school.  It was more responsibility (owning things cradle to grave) than while he was in school \n\n* Keiran learned a number of different technologies here including Novell. \n\n* A key project was unifying the networks of a number of different schools (each very similar), which allowed Keiran to move around a bit. \n\n* Keiran was not making much money at the time and leveraged an IT mailing list to find his replacement and to make his goals of getting a new job clear.  He wanted out of education. \n\n* A very large school in Brisbane ended up calling him about a job. \n\n* The school was not yet virtualized. \n\n* Keiran learned about a number of different certification options (CCNA, MCITP). \n\n* He failed the MCITP twice due to lack of review.  This was a humbling experience. \n\n* At this point he started learning about VMware products and involved himself in community. \n\n* He started to see where he wanted to progress (into the VMware space).  The school's small environment made it challenging to move to companies with larger environments and more feature usage. \n\n* He ended up being too focused on this specific technology area (but did not realize it yet). \n\n* Listen to Keiran's stories from multiple interviews with a particular CEO. \n\n* The CEO did something very unexpected, and Keiran has never forgotten it. \n\n* Don't be afraid to ask for feedback in / after an interview. \n\n* Despite not getting the job, Keiran still received feedback.  What was the impact of the feedback? \n\n* Keiran's current company took a chance on him despite thinking his focus was still a bit narrow. \n\n* The range of technologies he gets to touch in this role has helped him build skills in other areas that were previous blind spots. \n\n## 21:20 - Getting into Blogging \n\n* How did Keiran get into blogging? \n\n* He was heavy into Mac when he worked for the school (mentioned earlier) and thought about creating some tutorials. \n\n* Keiran had met others through techexams.net that encouraged blogging. \n\n* He wasn't quite sure what to blog about at first and pumped out a wide variety of content.  The posts became less frequent but still contained an element of education in them. \n\n* Due to the impact of his blogging, Keiran also participated in [Tech Field Day 18](https://techfieldday.com/event/tfd18/) in February 2019 in Austin, TX. \n\n* Keiran had been at [Storage Field Day 16](https://techfieldday.com/event/sfd16/) as his first experience. \n\n* There are some folks in Brisbane who have been past delegates who encouraged to Keiran to participate and also made a formal recommendation that he be selected. \n\n* Because of Tech Field Day and his increased following, Keiran is more critical of blog posts he publishes (more time reviewing the blogs, etc.). \n\n* The event is live streamed, so not everything is about the blogging.  Questions to vendors can be delivered in person, or contributions can be made via blogging. \n\n* The Tech Field Day experience makes you want to go back again. \n\n* Keiran goes back to the interaction with the CEO (who referenced his blog in their discussions). \n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-47":{"title":"Episode 47","content":"\n# Episode 47\n\nWelcome to episode 47 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss Keiran Shelden's article, \"You, Your Health, and the Datacenter\".   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-05-2019 \n\nThis discussion is partly a follow up to Keiran's blog on [You, Your Health, and the Datacenter]([https://readysetvirtual.wordpress.com/2017/12/08/you-your-health-and-the-datacenter/](https://readysetvirtual.wordpress.com/2017/12/08/you-your-health-and-the-datacenter/)). \n\nTopic – Keiran Shelden, Career Advancement, and Unexpected Feedback \n\n=================================================================== \n\n## 01:46 - Context of the Blog post \n\n* The article was a brain dump from the day after he finished a massive project. \n\n* The business needed to downsize its infrastructure by the end of the month to save money, and Keiran was in charge of the decommissioning. \n\n* He managed the list of customers affected and communicating the maintenance window to them, how the servers were wired and configured, and took on the role of actually doing the decommissioning (required he visit the datacenter). \n\n* In the last week of the project he had to go out to the datacenter every night (60 hours in 4 days). \n\n* The entire process was extremely draining physically and mentally. \n\n* He still tried to carry his normal workload during all of this, would not take breaks, and just kept going. \n\n* Keiran finally realized \"I can't do that.  I have stretched myself to my limits.\" \n\n* On the final night, he asked someone to come and help instead of carrying the burden alone, and he has not forgotten the lesson that asking for help is not a sign of weakness. \n\n## 08:58 Project Failure vs. Personal Health Failure \n\n* The project was not a disaster but just very fragile (i.e. caused Keiran to push himself to the limits). \n\n* Keiran got sick after the project was finished and considers this a failure. \n\n* We as employees want to go beyond at times and do our very best, but putting yourself at risk is never a good idea. \n\n## 11:56 Personal Risk Factors for Burnout \n\n* Keiran's story resonates with a number of us in the technology space. \n\n* In a previous role, Keiran's technical mistakes began to haunt him. \n\n* When presented with this particular project, Keiran felt the need to prove to himself and others that he could see it through successfully. \n\n* Experiences in our past have the potential to haunt us later in life.   \n\n* Keiran cites a book by [Osher Gunsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osher_G%C3%BCnsberg), which you can find [here](https://www.amazon.com/Back-After-Break-Osher-G%C3%BCnsberg-ebook/dp/B07B4N1CYP), that resonated with him on this topic. \n\n* In the real world, having the realization of a problem is the first step to solving it (unlike in the movies). \n\n* Keiran mentions the fears and nervousness that come in regard to public speaking (as well as being on this podcast).  It's something many of us can understand. \n\n* John cites two modes of thought...storytelling mode and experiential mode...and the inability to be in both simultaneously.  Can you relate? \n\nSource:[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning - Refactor Your Wetware by Andy Hunt](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning) Section 3.1 - Your Dual-CPU Modes \n\n* After Keiran put the blog post on Twitter, he felt it may be helpful to deliver his experience as a presentation but has not yet done it. \n\n* Send [Keiran](https://twitter.com/keiran_shelden?lang=en) a Tweet, and encourage him to submit this presentation for a user group talk! \n\n## 26:45 Reflections and Learning \n\n* We peel back the onion further on Keiran's experience \n\n* Working all night or all day can be a strain on your family.  Keiran (just like many of us) continues to focus on work / life balance. \n\n* \"Why keep food on my table if I don't have a family?\" \n\n* In the month before this project, 3 people in different departments had left the company.  Keiran did not effectively communicate his increase in workload to management.  \n\n* Nick shares a similar experience and emphasizes management may not understand just how much work you're doing. \n\n* Keiran shares a more recent experience in which he applied lessons learned from the 4-day project mentioned in his blog. \n\n* It was another case of being under resourced but was managed very differently despite a tight timeline. \n\n* Companies of all sizes have teams where there is a lack of redundancy in people and skills. \n\n* It's all about a compromise when it comes to resources, people, and budget.   \n\n* Additional lessons learned \n\n* For Keiran, ego was a problem.  He discovered this issue while at his current employer. \n\n* He referenced failing some certification exams because of ego. \n\n* Look at yourself...reflect...know what you want to be able to achieve...know what the business is asking for...understand what other people are doing...get exposure to a number of technologies. \n\n* Keiran is discovering how software development works and how automation works.   \n\n* He saw these areas as challenging and intimidating at first but has started to push past these perceptions by getting started. \n\n* Start small when it comes to automation. \n\n* John gives Keiran a homework assignment. \n\n* It's not about the number of followers on social media but that you produce good content. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-48":{"title":"Episode 48","content":"\n# Episode 48\n\nWelcome to episode 48 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

Achieving Happiness: Building Your Brand and Your Career.  See the content catalog link for the [US Session]([https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld19us/us19catalog?search=PD1407U](https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld19us/us19catalog?search=PD1407U)) and the [EU Session](https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld19eu/eu19catalog?search=PD1407E) to add it to your personalized agenda. \n\n* The Nerd Journey crew (John and Nick) will be at VMworld US 2019 this year.  Come chat with us! \n\n* John is doing a VMware {code} session entitled \"Save the IT Department: Add the Development Platform to Your Portfolio\".  The content catalog link to it can be found [here]([https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld19us/us19catalog?search=%22save%20the%20it%20department%22](https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld19us/us19catalog?search=%22save%20the%20it%20department%22)). \n\n* Nick is doing a vBrownBag session entitled \"Pi in the Sky: Using Wavefront to Analyze Pi-hole Data\".  See the content catalog link [here]([https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld19us/us19catalog?search=%22nick%20korte%22](https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld19us/us19catalog?search=%22nick%20korte%22)). \n\n## 4:37 - Diving into the Session \n\n* 5:27 Happiness in your career \n\n* Aligning goals, desires, employer, and career path was something John learned from discussions with a career coach. \n\n* The distinction between role responsibilities and role requirements are important to identify.  Know what you've agreed to do. \n\n* Often times we lose track of personal requirements and weighting them over professional requirements. \n\n* Time with family and friends and on hobbies is important too. \n\n* Go back and listen to the episodes with Keiran Shelden on this: \n\n* [Episode 46]([http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-046-career-advancement-keiran-shelden-pt-1/](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-046-career-advancement-keiran-shelden-pt-1/)) \n\n* [Episode 47](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-047-you-your-health-and-the-datacenter-with-keiran-shelden-pt-2/) \n\n* Think about project work associated with any job and the distinction between those you have to work on and those you get to work on from flexibility of the role or a need that arises.  Is that type of flexibilit important to you? \n\n* 9:59 Personal brand \n\n* It might be better to call it professional reputation since personal brand is a little bit of a buzz word these days. \n\n* There are ways to decode your brand from personality to communication.  Also the way you make people feel is important. \n\n* It is extremely important to be honest in your self-assessment.   \n\n* Get honest, constructive feedback from others. \n\n* Don't just work on strengths.  Consider opportunities to develop personally and professionally that build on weak areas. \n\n* 14:44 Career \n\n* Amanda gave some great definitions for what a career is. \n\n* The things we do at work do not define us.  Defining yourself based on the things you do can lead to negative self-perception. \n\n* Identification of paths, mentorship, research, and planning with your manager are all part of a career journey. \n\n* Creating your own position is a possibility but takes some work.  Think back to Tom Delicati's approach on this from [Episode 13](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-013-the-sniper-approach-to-job-hunting-with-tom-delicati/). \n\n* The Q \u0026 A from the VMworld US session had more material on this specific topic and how to approach it. \n\n* 19:21 Brand and Career \n\n* Developing a brand / reputation is a continual process.  It takes work to form this into what you want it to be. \n\n* Making decisions is easier when you define what you want your brand and career to be. \n\n* A reputation of saying yes to everything can hurt you and prevent follow through. \n\n* Generally before being promoted into a new role, one must be performing many of the tasks of someone in the new role already. \n\n* 23:32 Questions and answers from both sessions \n\n* Someone asked what managers could do to help identify and focus the development of individual contributors on the team.  Go listen to it (VMworld US recording). \n\n* John cites his favorite question overall asked – recognizing organizations that are not supportive of individual development (VMworld US recording). \n\n* What if you feel trapped / unsupported at your current job? \n\n* Can advancement happen without a mentor? (VMworld Europe recording) \n\n* Go listen to what Joe and Amanda have to say on this topic.  How formal should mentorship be? \n\n* 30:26 Summary \n\n* This session is a prescriptive approach that makes you think. \n\n* It really gets into the \"how\" of progression and reputation building and isn't just a high-level discussion.  It's not career markitecture. \n\n* Amanda mentioned having to read a bunch of books about interacting with people to learn this skillset better. \n\n* John saw this session live and will go see it again this year.

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss Paid Time Off with the first part of our interview with Marisa Eckberg.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-17-2019 \n\nTopics – Part 1 with Marisa Eckberg - Paid Time Off and Company Culture \n\n* We wanted to talk about PTO with an HR professional to shine a light on one way to avoid burnout in IT. We did previously talk to Keiran Shelden about IT burnout in [Episode 46](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-046-career-advancement-keiran-shelden-pt-1/) and [Episode 47](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-047-you-your-health-and-the-datacenter-with-keiran-shelden-pt-2/) \n\n## 6:10 -  What Do Human Resources People Do? \n\n* Our guest this week is [Marisa Eckberg]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/marisaeckberg/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marisaeckberg/)), an HR Consultant with over 40 clients of various sizes and in various industries. \n\n* She helps companies with strategy and compliance, helps with audits, builds compensation structures, conducts salary surveys, and works on performance management.  It depends on the company as to which of these they need or want. \n\n* Companies don't always realize the responsibilities that come with hiring and onboarding employees. \n\n* Outsourcing HR allows businesses to focus on the business and not on having Human Resources expertise (similar to outsourcing accounting, web design, or other things). \n\n## 10:03 – Frameworks for Evaluating Paid Time Off (PTO) Policies \n\n* There are no federal laws requiring PTO be given to employees.  It is a benefit. \n\n* There are states and cities requiring paid sick time for employees, however. \n\n* Ask potential employers about their benefit plans holistically before accepting an offer (not just PTO). \n\n* PTO in an offer is negotiable.  Remember that! \n\n* At the time of this recording, unemployment was very low.  High quality candidates will likely already have jobs. \n\n* One way employees try to retain and attract talent is offering unlimited PTO (seems to be a trend). \n\n* Unlimited PTO saves the employer from needing to pay out any unused hours when an employee leaves the company. \n\n* Some states do not have to pay out unused PTO (if there is a cap) when an employee leaves.  Marisa provides specific examples. \n\n* Keep an eye on your PTO balance, and please take it! \n\n* Studies show employees take about the same number of days off when at companies with unlimited PTO vs. those who have specific allotments per year. \n\n* The average is 12-14 days plus 8 holidays. \n\n* Does organizational size matter for those offering unlimited PTO? \n\n* The company's industry and workforce makeup are more important to consider here instead of company size.  Listen to Marisa's examples of where this may / may not fit. \n\n* Marisa mentioned for companies giving a specific PTO allotments, tenure is usually the separator between lower and higher PTO allotments rather than employee classification (salary vs. hourly). \n\n* Management and above may get more PTO by default. \n\n## 20:21 – Benefits as an Expression of Company Culture \n\n* Companies must create their own brand when recruiting. \n\n* Productivity goes up when employees take time off and don't feel penalized by doing it. \n\n* Should managers point out poor employee PTO utilization to direct reports? \n\n* Can handbook policies indicate employees are not to be contacted during PTO? \n\n* Managers can help here.  Encourage employees to offload projects / assign someone as a backup resource. \n\n* Hourly employees must be paid for any hours worked outside the office. \n\n* Salaried employees are people paid while they are out on vacation.   \n\n* Taking the occasional call might be ok, but if this adds up to significant work, talk to your manager about getting that time back. \n\n* There is no law to replenish someone's PTO bank because they worked while on vacation. \n\n* During the interview process, when is the right time to ask about what PTO days are like (i.e. adequate coverage, what to expect in responsiveness, etc.)? \n\n* Marisa disagrees with John on the timing of this. \n\n* Remember you are interviewing the company as well as them interviewing you. \n\n* Saving this for late stage interviews with the hiring manager may be best. \n\n* How does the manager view / manage time off for the team?  What is their philosophy on being completely unplugged?  This is part of the manager's management style? \n\n* Ask these same questions to the team. \n\n* Coming back to PTO as a negotiation point... \n\n* Marisa gives a great example of a crafty employee who did this at an unexpected time. \n\n* There is nothing wrong with asking for more even if a policy states a specific maximum. \n\n* Marisa's motto...don't be afraid to use your PTO! \n\n## [Contact

Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two VMware Solution Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we have part 2 of our discussion with [Marisa Eckberg]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/marisaeckberg/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marisaeckberg/)). We discuss how the Human Resources department affects company culture, evaluating company culture from the outside, and when to go to HR with issues.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-17-2019 \n\nTopics – Part 2 with Marisa Eckberg - Human Resources and Company Culture  \n\n## 03:01 – Human Resources and Company Culture \n\n* Senior leadership has different perceptions of HR.  This limits the overall impact. \n\n* Keeping them out of legal trouble \n\n* Champions of culture who offer management strategies, help encourage productivity, etc. \n\n* Help make this \"a cool place to work\" \n\n* Kill off the annual performance review \n\n* Need HR to be the police \n\n* There is a transition in HR in relation to titles \n\n* Chief People Officer \n\n* Human Capital Management \n\n* People Operations \n\n* Chief People Strategist \n\n* Note: Over the years this industry has changed from Personnel to Human Resources to People-centric \n\n## 08:12 – Detecting How a Company Values Culture \n\n* Check the company's social media pages as well as Glassdoor.  Are employees posting about what is happening at the company? \n\n* Marisa does \"sleuth work\" on new clients in this way. \n\n* Search for people who currently work for the company or some who have worked there in the past in similar roles. \n\n* Culture is organic.  HR is a facilitator of culture. \n\n* Maybe they facilitate a costume contest for Halloween or approach management with the idea to do it. \n\n* Marisa gives the example of [Zappos]([https://www.zappos.com/](https://www.zappos.com/)). \n\n* The company allows employees to do things they want to do to keep the environment fun. \n\n* Zappos looks for cultural fit in interviews and turns people away who are not a fit. \n\n* Book recommendation – [Built on Value by Ann Rhoades]([https://www.amazon.com/Built-Values-Creating-Outperforms-Competition/dp/0470901926](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Values-Creating-Outperforms-Competition/dp/0470901926)) \n\n* Do companies \"culture wash\" their speak to attract talent? \n\n* Company culture is definitely a buzz phrase, but it comes down to employee engagement (connection between the employee and the work they are doing for the company, feeling of constributing to something bigger). \n\n* Cool amenities are nice but do not promote employee engagement. \n\n* What do employees doing the work need to stay engaged? \n\n* Before you start looking for companies and applying for jobs, find out what you value.  Likely you want a company with similar values to get a good fit. \n\n* See [Episode 17]([http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-017-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-part-2-2-during-interviews-and-after-the-offer/](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-017-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-part-2-2-during-interviews-and-after-the-offer/)) on the idea of value match. \n\n* Who can help an employee change company culture? \n\n* If you have a good relationship with your manager, start there.  Ask if you should talk to HR. \n\n* You can certainly still talk to HR, but bring ideas (positive suggestions) and not complaints. \n\n* Come with suggestions to solve problems / improve the culture. \n\n* Maybe HR could help programmatize something that worked really well for your team so that it can help other teams. \n\n## 26:05 – Going to HR with Issues \n\n* When should employees go to HR with a problem? \n\n* Is HR only there to protect employer reputation? \n\n* Take policy violations to HR. \n\n* Personal conflicts with a coworker may be better suited for a conversation with your manager.  HR is probably going to ask you this. \n\n* HR is more of an escalation point...unless you don't feel comfortable speaking to your manager about it. \n\n* Don't make your first interaction with HR a situation where you are raising a problem.   \n\n* Say hello when you see the HR team.  Built some rapport first if possible.   \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-51":{"title":"Episode 51","content":"\n# Episode 51\n\nWelcome to episode 51 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/](mailto:@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/))]!

In the first half of our discussion with Charlie Nichol, we talk about his early career and his transition to management.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-28-2019 \n\n* Charlie is currently a Senior Solution Engineering Manager for VMware's Central US region (focusing on Enterprise) and has been with the company for 8 years.  He manages a team of field pre-Sales SEs spanning Texas to Wisconsin.  \n\n# Topics – Transition to Management with [[Charlie Nichol]] \n\n\n## 2:40 Intro and Early Career \n\n* Career history \n\n* Charlie started in IT in high school and worked at a number of places after that.   \n\n* He cut his teeth at Almost Media Games while setting up globally available and highly redundant bingo and lottery systems. \n\n* He later worked for Sequel Data Systems in Austin doing some pre-Sales and some post-Sales work related to networking, storage, and virtualization.  This also involved training customers to operate the systems he installed. \n\n* Charlie also did work for Home Depot on the Windows Engineering team and as part of the storage team. \n\n* He later went to Dell and worked on a product team called Virtualization Solutions Engineering, writing performance white papers for hardware vendors. \n\n* There was no Googling.  He helped write the performance whitepapers people would later Google. \n\n* After giving a number of demos to technical people and high level executives, Charlie found he enjoyed explaining technology to people.  \n\n* A friend encouraged him to interview for an Inside  Solution Engineer position with VMware.  The rest is history. \n\n* Charlie comments on why he feels the SE job is the best job. \n\n## 8:48 – Transition from Individual Contributor to Manager \n\n* When Charlie first joined VMware, he felt like being a SE was his career path. \n\n* Being an Inside SE involved doing many demos and working with customers from different parts of the country. \n\n* Charlie's boss kept asking what was next in his career path. \n\n* At first, Charlie was thinking a CTO type role or an architect could make sense. \n\n* His boss encouraged him to pursue leadership (not something Charlie wanted).   \n\n* The two paths within the SE space were to climb the individual contributor ladder to Principal or to move to leadership. \n\n* Charlie's desire was to stay close to the technology and maintain technical credibility. \n\n* His manager had an uncanny knack for knowing when to throw an interesting project Charlie's way.   \n\n* Since Charlie trusted his manager to help him succeed, he decided to take the manager's advice to pursue leadership. \n\n* Charlie's manager began to groom him so we would be ready when a manager position opened. \n\n* Charlie would sit in on meetings, take care of reports, or run a team meeting now and again. \n\n* After the bug was put in Charlie's ear, he started looking for opportunities to take on leadership tasks.  Was it the frequency illusion? \n\n* Charlie shares the story of meeting a new VP and how he took the opportunity to educate his VP. \n\n* This led to the VP wanting a SE presence in future decision making meetings, and Charlie was top of mind for this task. \n\n* Charlie had developed a rapport with the Inside Sales Managers as well as the VP during this time. \n\n* Once Charlie knew one of the SE Managers was about to resign, he set his own interview with the key stakeholders, asking for their blessing in his pursuit of the role and for feedback. \n\n* Charlie had started asking his manager for feedback on what he could do better way before this happened. This made him ready to accept the feedback from other leaders when he interviewed to become a leader. \n\n* Charlie points out asking the key stakeholders about their expectations of him as a leader and that based on his previous interactions with those people, he already had some of the answers. \n\n* The reasons things look easy is because people put in the work to get really good. \n\n* Charlie ended up going from player to coach (became the manager of the team he was a part of). \n\n* Most of his teammates had the same attitude toward leadership as he originally did (did not want it).   \n\n* The original discussion with the VP started a pattern for Charlie.  He still today offers to train new Sales and technical leaders who come in from outside the company. \n\n* This builds a relationship and credibility that can be leveraged in future situations that require difficult conversations. \n\n* John weighs in on potential political risks of building a relationship with someone above your boss or peers with someone above your boss. \n\n* In Charlie's case, he was one of the few technical leaders working in the same location as the new VP (kind of an ideal scenario). \n\n## 27:08 – Adapting to the Manager Responsibility Set \n\n* It was way harder than Charlie thought.  Leadership is different than management. \n\n* He knew how to motivate the top performers because he was one.  Charlie did not know how to motivate those not performing well. \n\n* The first days as a manager were a glimpse behind the curtain.  The reason some things happen is because managers step in and take care of it (often times without others knowing). \n\n* Charlie had to build new relationships with many people within the organization who worked in different areas he had never met. \n\n* Charlie had to lay someone off in his 3rd week as a manager.  He struggled with this one greatly. \n\n* His manager and HR helped.  He even practiced with his Sales Manager peer.  It was not fun, but he faced a fear early in the role. \n\n* Charlie took the aspects of every good manager he had met / interacted with and used them to create his own methodology.   \n\n* One example was the 7 minute practice. \n\n* Charlie quickly realized not everyone is motivated by the same thing. \n\n* 36:58 What about hiring SEs?  What is that like? \n\n* Charlie did not have an opinion on it in the beginning but felt he had an eye for talent.   \n\n* The interview is a time to learn who someone is. \n\n* Charlie was hiring inside SEs at first, but he slowly added more field candidates over time.  His current team is made up entirely field SEs. \n\n* The type of person for an inside SE is different than a field SE. \n\n* Example interview question for an inside SE - \"Are you ready to step away from the keyboard a little bit?\" \n\n* If you like explaining and teaching things to both technical and nontechnical people, and if you like giving presentations, you could be a good fit for a SE role.   \n\n* Charlie gives an example of someone who became a SE for a short time and went back to IT operations and the benefits of the exposure. \n\n* Charlie looks for... \n\n* Good communicators (written and verbal) \n\n* Passion for technology and learning new things \n\n* Those who are ok with NOT doing the technology implementation \n\n* Those who like talking to people and solving their problems \n\n* People oriented (i.e. customer oriented) \n\n* Comfortable dealing with ambiguity \n\n* Listen to Charlie's example questions for people to prove they can talk to people at different levels in the organization and connect the technology to the business. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-52":{"title":"Episode 52","content":"\n# Episode 52\n\nWelcome to episode 52 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/](mailto:@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/))]!

In the second half of our discussion with Charlie Nichol, we talk about his advice for those considering management as a career, as well as the ins and outs of team development. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-28-2019 \n\n* Charlie is currently a Senior Solution Engineering Manager for VMware's Central US region (focusing on Enterprise) and has been with the company for 8 years.  He manages a team of field pre-Sales SEs spanning Texas to Wisconsin.  \n\n# Topics – Considering Management Careers and Developing Teams with [[Charlie Nichol]] \n\n[[Episode 51]]\n\n## 03:51 – Advice for Those Thinking about Becoming a Manager \n\n* Charlie recommends Ben Bergeron's [Chasing Excellence Podcast]([https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/built-by-bergeron/chasing-excellence-with-ben-bergeron](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/built-by-bergeron/chasing-excellence-with-ben-bergeron)) \n\n* Questions to consider \n\n* What is important to you? \n\n* Where do you want to be when you retire? \n\n* What do you like about your current job? \n\n* What skills are needed to get to where you would like to be, and how do you get experience with those skills? \n\n* What skills do you have now that are already a good fit? \n\n* Charlie gives the example of eventually running a company and what could be done to master the financial side of that. \n\n* Ideas... \n\n* Read leadership books \n\n* Listen to leadership podcasts \n\n* Ask for a 1-1 with a leader to get feedback on awkward situations.  Most managers are willing to have this kind of meeting with you. \n\n* How do you know if you want to be a manager? \n\n* Do the things discussed in our previous episode sound exciting? \n\n* Are you ready to step away even further from the keyboard?  You are not an expert on the technology any longer. \n\n* Are you ready to focus more on the people and helping them succeed? \n\n* The best way to find out is to go do it!  You won't know for sure until you try it. \n\n* Have career conversations with your manager like we discussed in [Episode 45](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-045-career-conversations-with-your-manager/).  [[Episode 45]]\n\n* Go find someone who has something you want, and interview that person. \n\n* Don't rule it out as an option automatically.  Maintain a growth mindset. \n\n* If you are good at it, great! \n\n* If you don't like it, identify the reasons for this.  Is it company culture, lack of a mentor, a dislike for dealing with people, etc.? \n\n* Being a manager does not have to be forever.   \n\n* If people are telling you to pursue it, they may be right about your potential. \n\n* Keep in mind individual contributors may already be acting as leaders. \n\n## 10:50 – Developing a Team \n\n* This was something Charlie had to learn. \n\n* A really good SE (or other individual contributor) may not make the best manager.   \n\n* Helping a struggling employee is not just telling them the answer / pointing them to how you would do it. \n\n* People have to fail.   \n\n* Sometimes not stepping in when people are headed down the wrong path is the right thing to do.  Providing coaching later allows them to learn. \n\n* Charlie has been in a number of leadership trainings since joining VMware.  These are focused on coaching. \n\n* Coaching takes more time and is much harder than giving the answer. \n\n* Learn to ask the right questions to have someone arrive at the answer on their own. \n\n* Listen to the feedback Charlie received from one of his individual contributors after a customer meeting that changed his perspective.   \n\n* Coaching does not always go from manager to individual contributor.  It can be bidirectional. \n\n* Charlie likes to ask the team what he can do better to open the door for them to pass feedback to him. \n\n* 18:23 What should be discussed in a 1-1? \n\n* Charlie likes the first half to be an opportunity to get to know the employee (i.e. check in on their personal life).  \n\n* Listen to his tip on how to clear your mind before a call. \n\n* Address the things the individual contributor would like to address during the rest of the call. \n\n* With the right tools for visibility and feedback in place, you can address real challenges and what the employee needs to be successful. \n\n* Charlie provides an agenda template to employees but asks the employee to bring agenda items.  Some people use this and some take a free format approach. \n\n* Career conversations are separate from these normal 1-1s.  Those conversations need to be something outside the day-to-day fires. \n\n* It is important to give 100% of your focus as a manager on a 1-1 call.  This may be the only 30 minutes the two of you get to talk. \n\n* Charlie mentioned it was easy not to protect 1-1 time for the employees he saw in person every day. \n\n* Checking text messages during this time for in-person 1-1s sends a message that the discussion at hand is less important. \n\n* Rather than cancelling 1-1s, Charlie prefers to move them.  He likes to keep them weekly. \n\n* The culture of weekly 1-1s... \n\n* There is no industry accepted answer for 1-1 frequency that Charlie has found. \n\n* His manager made sure to reschedule 1-1s well before they started, and that had an impact on Charlie.  Cancelling a 1-1 right before it happens can come off as rude (especially if done frequently). \n\n* A 1-1 is where the rubber meets the road.  Be on time, ask about the person's life, and focus your attention. \n\n* Nick highlights the differences in 1-1s after getting out of IT operations. \n\n* Are they a challenge because there are so many ways to communicate with people today? \n\n* Focusing on the 1-1 removes awkwardness and builds a relationship between manager and employee. \n\n* The job of a manager is to be a guide to the employee.  \n\n* Good leaders want to see their people get promoted. \n\n* Attrition will happen, whether positive or negative.  The manager must be prepared for this. \n\n* It is rewarding to see people surpass their own expectations. \n\n* Don't miss the good stuff by being unprepared for this. \n\n## 39:09 – Closing Thoughts \n\n* Is the progression of individual contributors a good metric for a manager? \n\n* This is a sign of a servant leader. \n\n* Will asking about career path ruffle your manager's feathers? \n\n* It's possible.  If the manager pushes back on you... \n\n* Ask...what is your manager's vision of what you would be good at and where you should go in your career? \n\n* If they are not supportive of you, you can learn how to work for a difficult manager.  This skill translates into many other areas (i.e. dealing with a difficult customer, motivating people who don't work for you to do things you want, etc.). \n\n* Deal with the difficult person by having a conversation. \n\n* There is something to be learned in every situation. \n\n* This job is what it is.  What skills can I learn right now to get to where I want to be? \n\n* Find those people you admire who have the job you think you might want.  Ask them what they like and don't like about the job.  Ask them for feedback on whether you would be a fit. \n\n* Charlie reiterates every job he has had to date built him up for what he does now.  Not everyone looks at it that way, but perhaps we should. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the

In today's episode we discuss how to prepare for unanticipated career opportunities, part 2. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 09-30-2019 \n\n* John's last day at VMware was 10/4/2019.  Listen carefully to his reasons for making a change.  Do they sound like advice you've heard before? \n\nTopics – Preparing for Unexpected Career Opportunities, Part 2 \n\n=============================================================================================================================================== \n\n## 04:10 – After Initial Contact, A Methodology \n\n* Go back to [part 1 of this series](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-1/) if you missed it. \n\n* Some basic assumptions \n\n* A great job at a great company won't last forever. \n\n* Most people don't work for the same company for many years / retire from the company where they started in the work force. \n\n* Companies get acquired, make acquisitions, and go out of business. \n\n* Contact was unsolicited \n\n* Should you respond to every unsolicited request from a recruiter?   \n\n* If you aren't interested, be honest.   \n\n* John recommends communicating the mismatch, the reasoning behind it, and being polite.  Feel free to borrow his script. \n\n* Offering to pass along solid candidates to the recruiter is a great way to build rapport and will help your network. \n\n* Politely saying no to someone can actually benefit you in the long run.  This could be a chance for the recruiter to recognize talent and dig into what you really want in a new opportunity (at some point).  It's probably best not to offer this information unless you get asked. \n\n* Should you accept a LinkedIn request from a recruiter, or is that a red flag that you might be looking for work elsewhere?  Nick and John weigh in. \n\n* Is not looking for a new job an advantage when speaking with a recruiter? \n\n* Absolutely – if you don't need a job, you begin in a power position and can entertain only things that are interesting. \n\n* What if you are interested? \n\n* Things recruiters say to hook you... \n\n* Perhaps there is a mismatch (a position level seems wildly out of step with where you are now even though the industry may be similar).  This could be an opportunity to get feedback on how you're marketing yourself and how it is perceived by others.  John has an interesting example to share. \n\n* I noticed you're showing \"not interested.\"  Can you share 3 things that would cause you to rethink that and pursue an opportunity elsewhere? \n\n* This is a blatant Sales tactic.  But it's effective and really makes you think.  Would you be able to answer these? \n\n* Similar industry, similar position, all the right trigger words \n\n* Each of these scenarios make for an interesting next conversation. \n\n* Evaluate your own situation so you are ready for these conversations.  No one can answer the questions for you. \n\n* What if you're looking to do more or less travel? \n\n* What if you want to move to a different industry? \n\n* You never know what is possible until you think about it.   \n\n* Maybe it's a list of 5 things you like about what you do / where you are, 5 things you dislike, and 5 things that are stretch goals. \n\n## 25:11 – To Tell or Not to Tell Your Boss This Happened \n\n* Should you tell your boss a recruiter contacted you? \n\n* It doesn't seem like there is an advantage to doing so. \n\n* If you are unhappy in your current position, you should be discussing an improvement to the work environment during 1-1s on a regular basis. \n\n* If 1-1s are not happening, maybe that's a red flag. \n\n* Don't wait until a recruiter contacts you to say you're unhappy. \n\n* If you must make a change due to current life circumstances, there is no advantage to letting your employer know ahead of time.  But it is polite to give proper notice once you have a signed offer in hand. \n\n* Talking with the recruiter could open your eyes to how your current role could change or to something you might like in a new role.   \n\n* Is there a way to incorporate something you heard under your current manager or a new goal you need to set?  Bring an interesting idea to your manager based on what you learned. \n\n* Maybe your current manager can help you get there. \n\n* Are there projects that would help fill skills gaps in the mean time? \n\n* Listen to the [Jon Hildebrand episode](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-038-jon-hildebrand-and-recovering-from-a-layoff/) where we found out Jon's manager saw he needed something different even before he did. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-55":{"title":"Episode 55","content":"\n# Episode 55\n\nWelcome to episode 55 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss how to prepare for unanticipated career opportunities, part 3, Agreeing to Discuss Opportunities. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-03-2019 \n\nTopics – Preparing for Unexpected Career Opportunities, Part 3 Agreeing to Discuss Opportunities \n\n================================================================================================= \n\n## 01:57 – A Review of Earlier Series Episodes \n\n* Go back and listen to [part 1](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-1/) and [part 2](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-2/) of this series if you missed them! \n\n* John gives a brief overview of what we covered in those episodes \n\n## 03:23 - The Desire to Have a Conversation...Expressing Interest after Initial Contact \n\n* Scenario – Unsolicited contact / voluntary contact \n\n* What would it take to get you to make a change? \n\n* John reminds us that we should know the answer to this already.  Revisit this frequently. \n\n* What do I like / not like, and what is the dream scenario? \n\n* Consider also... \n\n* Personal value \n\n* Satisfaction with compensation \n\n* Amount of travel \n\n* Different, interesting role (perhaps in a different industry) \n\n* A specific company of interest \n\n* Remember to [Dream in Bands](http://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/) \n\n* 6:34 What questions should you ask during this first conversation? \n\n* Find out exactly what the hiring process looks like.  Get all of the details from first contact to offer letter. \n\n* Highlight your relevant experiences through the lens of what this new company is looking for in candidates.  Does your LinkedIn profile reflect this?  It should. \n\n* What does the company want in an ideal candidate?  Understand exactly what the position is.  Figure it out now to avoid later surprises. \n\n* What is the timeline to fill this position? \n\n* How many others have been screened for this and presented to the hiring manager?  Know where you are in the pool (if possible) to set proper expectations.  \n\n* Recruiters may not be extremely honest about this to cast a wider net.  John shares his experiences here. \n\n* The goal is to get past this gatekeeper to talk to the next person in line (likely the hiring manager). \n\n* As much as we'd like to, don't hold the company responsible for how timely the recruiter is in getting back to you. On the other hand, if the hiring manager isn't timely, you have no reason to believe they'd treat you any differently if you're hired. Weigh that in your decision to move forward. \n\n* Keep in mind the recruiter's job is to make a placement.  Their job is to get qualified candidates into the funnel. \n\n* Go back and listen to [Episode 2](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-002-hr-and-hiring-manager-early-process-interviews/) on early process interviews \n\n* 15:07 Why should you move forward in the process after this first conversation if you're still not looking for a job? \n\n* It's good to keep practice interviewing.  Most of us do not do this as part of our jobs. \n\n* Be prepared for common scenario questions.  Many of them are about dealing with adversity.  It's important to have specific behavioral examples as answers. \n\n* You still may not understand why they called you originally and didn't get clarification from the recruiter. \n\n* 21:04 Should you leverage this for a raise at your current company? \n\n* If you do this, you have to be prepared to take an offer from a new employer. \n\n* Doing this means you are on your way out / thinking of leaving your current employer. \n\n* Does doing this exhibit a good image to your current employer?  You could potentially damage your brand with these actions. \n\n* Compensation should be coming up in 1-1s with your manager.  Find out how can he / she justify the raise for you. \n\n* If your manager does not want to or won't have this conversation, it could be a red flag and time to move. \n\n* 26:22 Beware of the boss.  If this opportunity came from within the company where you currently work, the manager could find out without you realizing. \n\n* If it is something you are going to pursue seriously, there comes a time where it makes sense to let your manager know.  It's a judgement call on your part. \n\n* Communicate necessity of confidentiality with the person you're speaking with if you're afraid of your manager finding out.   \n\n* 28:17 Scenario – Involuntary  \n\n* If you are unemployed, unexpected opportunities may seem more optimal than they would in a different situation. \n\n* The pressure is on, especially if you are not financially ready.  Sometimes you just need a job. \n\n* Proceed with necessary steps to get your resume in order and go from there.  There's no magic to it. \n\n* If you can, know your interests before you are in this situation. \n\n* It's ok to target a dream job after you get a job that pays the bills. \n\n## 35:37 - A Brief Review of Interview Tips \n\n* John mentions a [Manager Tools podcast episode](https://www.manager-tools.com/2019/09/post-interview-recruiter-communication) about post-interview recruiter communication. \n\n* Be ready to speak to the recruiter after each interview with one or two positive things about each conversation.  This helps you demonstrate interest to the recruiter at each step. \n\n* If a recruiter does not do this, it's likely NOT a red flag.  The recruiter may just not be trained to do it. \n\n* Previous episodes \n\n* #2 - [Screening and Early Hiring Manager Interviews](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-002-hr-and-hiring-manager-early-process-interviews/) \n\n* #9 - [Dressing for and blowing an interview](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-009-blowing-an-interview-and-dressing-for-an-interview/) \n\n* #11 - [Questions to as in an interview](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-011-questions-to-ask-in-an-interview-and-hero-complex/) \n\n* #15 - [Interview Myths](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-015-interview-myths-and-boss-problems/) \n\n* #17 - [Reasons not to pursue an opportunity, during interviews and after the offer](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-017-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-part-2-2-during-interviews-and-after-the-offer/) \n\n* #27 - [Ramzi](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-027-ramzi-marjaba-interview/) \n\n* #34 - [Jimmy Tassin](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-034-jimmy-tassin-career-path/) \n\n* #46 - [Keiran Shelden](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-046-career-advancement-keiran-shelden-pt-1/) \n\n* #49 - [Marisa Eckberg](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-049-marisa-eckberg-pt-1-paid-time-off-and-company-culture/) \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-56":{"title":"Episode 56","content":"\n# Episode 56\n\nWelcome to episode 56 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss how to prepare for unanticipated career opportunities, part 4, Decision Time! \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-03-2019 \n\nTopics – Preparing for Unexpected Career Opportunities, Part 4 \n\n=============================================================================================================================================== \n\n## 1:53 – A Review of the Series to Date \n\n* Go back and listen if you missed these episodes... \n\n* [Part 1 - Preparation](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-1/) \n\n* [Part 2 - Contact](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-2/) \n\n* [Part 3 - Agreeing to a Discussion](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-3-agreeing-to-discuss-opportunities/) \n\n## 2:20 - Decision Time \n\n* An offer letter is an official document describing terms of employment (with compensation package) for the potential employee to sign. \n\n* Likely you do not want to make a company put this together unless you're considering taking the offer. \n\n* John mentions the decision point should likely come before you receive an offer letter. \n\n* 4:20 Review of questions to ask yourself during the process  \n\n* Is this opportunity interesting enough to keep pursuing? \n\n* Am I interested in what the company is doing / the products it has, etc.? \n\n* Have I become more interested as a result of going through the process? \n\n* If at any point during the interview process you became disinterested, politely end the process. \n\n* Did you rank your priorities (money, travel, flexible schedule, area, support for family life, etc.)?   \n\n* What is most important to you that would motivate you to make a change?   \n\n* What tradeoffs would you be willing to make? \n\n* Review podcasts on reasons not to pursue an opportunity \n\n* [Episode 16 - Before Applying](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-016-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-1-before-applying/) \n\n* [Episode 17 - During Interviews or After the Offer](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-017-reasons-not-to-pursue-a-career-opportunity-part-2-2-during-interviews-and-after-the-offer/) \n\n* 11:58 The company making you an offer has to sell you on making the change.  It should be a better match to your priorities than you have today. \n\n* Don't forget to consider how the change will affect your family (spouse, children, etc.).   \n\n* Nick and John share anecdotes on being in close proximity to family. \n\n* 16:22 Should you leverage the offer for a raise at your current company, even if you are thinking about taking the job? \n\n* Again, the answer is likely no. \n\n* If this offer has exposed gaps at your current company, ask your employer to address them without posing the threat of leaving. \n\n* A perception of one foot out the door could be created. \n\n* 18:19 What if you turn down the offer? \n\n* Maintain professionalism no matter what. \n\n* Maybe the company making the offer just cannot meet your needs. \n\n* The art of saying no requires practice and can be difficult. \n\n* 20:29 What if you take the offer? \n\n* How soon should you let your current employer know you plan to leave?  What about navigating wait time for a background check process? \n\n* Ensure you capture ALL steps that need to happen before coming an employee at the new company.   \n\n* Some companies may do a background check before an offer.  Others may do it after that step. \n\n* Whatever notice you give to your employer needs to be after the go / no go point (all parts of process complete to be an employee at the new company). \n\n* Two weeks is customary notice when leaving an organization.  More may be needed in certain scenarios. \n\n* There is a possibility your last day will be the day you give notice.  It doesn't hurt to ask the new employer if you can start early if this happens. \n\n* Are you financially ready for a gap in pay if that happens? \n\n* 28:13 Ensuring a great transition \n\n* Go back and listen to [Episode 12](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-012-effective-1-on-1-meetings-with-your-manager-and-gracefully-leaving-an-organziation/) on gracefully leaving an organization for additional tips. \n\n* John shares a story about a colleague who helped him transition into some accounts as a SE and what he wanted a successful transition to look like when leaving VMware. \n\n* Make it a point to keep in touch with former colleagues. \n\n* Disseminating the fact that you are leaving is up to your manager.   \n\n* Be courteous about this, but let him / her know you would like your colleagues to know before your last day. \n\n* Is there something we missed in this series?  Please let us know by sending a Tweet or message on LinkedIn. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-57":{"title":"Episode 57","content":"\n# Episode 57\n\nWelcome to episode 57 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss how to prepare for unanticipated career opportunities, part 5, Lessons in Personal Finance. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-27-2019 \n\nTopics – Preparing for Unexpected Career Opportunities, Part 5 \n\n=============================================================================================================================================== \n\n## A Review of the Series to Date \n\n* Go back and listen if you missed these episodes... \n\n* [Part 1 - Preparation](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-1/) \n\n* [Part 2 - Contact](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-2/) \n\n* [Part 3 - Agreeing to a

Time](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-4-decision-time/) \n\n## 1:27 – Update on John's Employment \n\n* John is officially employed now and is a Customer Engineer at Google representing the [[Google Cloud]] portfolio of products. \n\n## 2:54 – Personal Finance \n\n* We realized a lot of the advice we gave in previous episodes centered around being in a financially health place and wanted to dig into that a bit further. \n\n* Financial struggles are an emotional strain whether you are employed or unemployed.  Debt applies pressure and drains mental energy from people.   \n\n* John cites lack of debt as a way to provide freedom during a job search. \n\n## 6:08 – Advice from Manager Tools \n\n* Check out the following episodes from Manager Tools: \n\n* [Getting Laid Off – Finances Rule](https://www.manager-tools.com/2007/11/getting-laid-off-finances-rule) \n\n* Their main advice in the event of a layoff is control expenses event before applying for other jobs. \n\n* They recommend a 6 month emergency fund to cover expenses in case this happens to you. \n\n* [Annual Layoff Immunization](https://www.manager-tools.com/2008/01/the-annual-layoff-immunization-part-1-of-2) \n\n* They advise have a number of items readily available at home... \n\n* Printed personal contacts list \n\n* This is not something proprietary from your last company...don't be that person. \n\n* Printed recruiter list \n\n* Access to business reviews \n\n* Current resume \n\n## 9:54 – Sharing Our Favorite Sources \n\n* John \n\n* [Personal Finance for Dummies Cheat Sheet](https://www.dummies.com/personal-finance/financial-help/personal-finance-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/) \n\n* [Bogleheads Personal Finance Planning Start-Up Kit](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads®_personal_finance_planning_start-up_kit) \n\n* Inspired by [John Bogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle) \n\n* There are articles on a number of immediate actions one can take to change personal finance situations. \n\n* Nick \n\n* [Dave Ramsey's 7 Baby Steps](https://www.daveramsey.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps) \n\n* Advice from [The Automatic Millionaire](https://davidbach.com/books/) by David Bach \n\n* The advice given here helps enable behavioral change needed for financial changes. \n\n## 13:27 Credit and Debt \n\n* Personal Finance for Dummies \n\n* Don't buy consumer items that lose value over time on credit.  Buy thinks with a stable or increasing value on credit. \n\n* Use credit cards only for convenience and not carrying debt. \n\n* Bogleheads \n\n* Pay down bad debt (high interest debt. \n\n* Prioritize investing in retirement, savings, and paying down loads. \n\n* See [paying down loans vs. Investing](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Paying_down_loans_versus_investing) article for more on this. \n\n* Getting rid of high interest debt can save the most money. \n\n* Dave Ramsey \n\n* Try the debt snowball – start by focusing on the smallest debt, then use that same money to pay off the next largest until everything paid off except the house. \n\n* This is more psychologically rewarding and changing to help build the habit. \n\n* Should you stop saving for retirement to pay off debt? \n\n* David Bach \n\n* It is more beneficial to start saving for retirement as early as you can. \n\n*  Tackle the highest interest debt first if you can, but the snowball method is also acceptable. \n\n* Make your bill payments automatic so there is no need to make a decision to do it every month. \n\n* Nick and John's Advice \n\n* Stick to it, and get your spouse / family on board with the plan to succeed. \n\n## 21:37 Expense Management \n\n* Personal Finance for Dummies \n\n* Live within your means.  There is no need to keep up with co-workers and peers.  This is challenging when you have children. \n\n* Bogleheads \n\n* Track expenses, and stay within budget.  Live below your means to help pay off debt. \n\n* Dave Ramsey  \n\n* Determine where you spend your money first. \n\n* David Bach \n\n* [The Latte Factor](https://www.thelattefactor.com/#podcast) is real.  What small changes can you make now to improve your financial state?    \n\n* Nick and John's Advice \n\n* Order water when you go out to eat, or go out to eat less often. \n\n* If the psychological reward of paying off debt is not enough, treat yourself now and then (within your means) to stay focused. \n\n* The latte is a stand in for any incremental indulgence.  Keep in mind large expense mistakes as well. \n\n## 25:34 Savings \n\n* Personal Finance for Dummies \n\n* Save and invest at least 5-10% of your income after paying off bad debt.  \n\n* Manager Tools says [save 10% of what you make](https://www.manager-tools.com/2015/03/personal-finance-save-10-what-you-make). \n\n* Dave Ramsey \n\n* Invest 15% of income in retirement after you pay down debt and have 3-6 months of living expenses. \n\n* David Bach \n\n* Invest in retirement from the beginning, even if it is only a little and increased later. \n\n* Pay yourself automatically BEFORE living expenses. \n\n* Nick and John's Advice \n\n* Take joy in your progress.  Substitute for the joy of spending money. \n\n## 28:29 Emergency Fund \n\n* Bogleheads \n\n* Save 3-12 months of living expenses (all household expenses).    \n\n* Dave Ramsey \n\n* Save $1000 for a liquid starter emergency fund before paying down the debt.  \n\n* Once debt is paid down, save 3-6 months of expenses. \n\n* Nick and John's Advice \n\n* Use the emergency fund only for emergencies! \n\n## 30:23 Retirement Investment \n\n* Personal Finance for Dummies \n\n* Avoid financial products carrying commissions and expenses. \n\n* Invest the majority of your long-term money in ownership vehicles that have appreciation potential, such as stocks, real estate, and your own business. \n\n* Bogleheads \n\n* Look at... \n\n* [Target Retirement Date](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Target_date_funds) funds \n\n* This types of funds are auto-balanced as you get closer to retirement to decrease risk.  It is far more difficult to select a single stock for investment than leveraging something like this. \n\n* [Three Index Fund Portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) for Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, etc. \n\n* ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) from Blackrock, Schwab, Vanguard, State Street, etc. \n\n* Employer matching funds (guaranteed rate of return) \n\n* John and Nick's Advice \n\n* Remember employee stock purchase programs (ESPP) and access to RSU (restricted stock units – vest based on tenure with the company) are investments as well. \n\n* Putting more money into ESPP is a way to get a greater return down the road for further investment or payment on debt if needed. \n\n* Diversify your investments.  Investing in stock of only your employer may be too much risk to carry. \n\n## 36:41 Home Ownership \n\n* Personal Finance for Dummies \n\n* Their verdict is own your home because it gains value \n\n* Bogleheads \n\n* The [own vs. rent decision](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Owning_vs_renting) - backed by analysis \n\n* Dave Ramsey \n\n* Pay off the house early, and save on the loan interest. \n\n* The majority of people do not regularly make an extra payment on the house. \n\n* John and Nick's Advice \n\n* John's pay as if method \n\n* Think about the type of down payment needed, what you have, price of house you are targeting, HOA fees, insurance and tax rates \n\n* Boil down to a monthly payment, and compare with your current rent. \n\n* If you could make up the difference between the two right now, start saving the difference. \n\n* If you can't make the payment today, how can you make it when you own the home? \n\n* Maybe you can't afford to own a home in the area where you live currently.  Is relocating a better financial option? \n\n## 43:15 When You're Doing Well \n\n* The sources we gave give advice in these areas too (not to be covered in this episode) \n\n* College funds \n\n* Broader insurance coverage \n\n* Charitable giving \n\n## 44:03 Closing Thoughts \n\n* Living debt free allows you to make better career decisions in bad situations (or even in good situations). \n\n* There are financial workshops out there as well as Dave Ramsey's [Financial Peace University](https://www.daveramsey.com/fpu). \n\n* Search YouTube for free videos on financial topics. \n\n* Talk to your mentees about finances to make sure they are making wise decisions.  Not every family teaches this to their children. \n\n* Credit cards can be like financial cocaine. \n\n* Promise yourself you will pay down debt and make smart decisions.  This makes your existing take home pay higher and gives you a raise. \n\n* John learned the \"live as if\" methodology from his mother.  Maybe it can provide a lesson for you. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we have part 1 of an interview with Kelly Schroeder about the path to management and some hard-won resume advice. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-15-2019 \n\n# Topics – [[Kelly Schroeder]] Interview \n\n## 03:09 - Kelly's Background \n\n* Kelly works for a city government as manager of help desk and all things end user related, overseeing a team of 15 people. \n\n* He came from the small business world where one must wear all the hats. \n\n* Kelly has experience working in a number of industries including a government contractor, a 2-year college, a web development firm, and has even owned his own business. \n\n* Nick and John met Kelly through the [Spiceworks community](https://community.spiceworks.com/). \n\n* After getting married, Kelly found a job through a friend.  He got started installing network wiring. \n\n* This was interesting (being a part of the technology industry) but not a job he specifically wanted to keep doing. \n\n* Kelly started at a 2-year college with a very technical focus and later went to a 4-year college, landing on a degree in business. \n\n* When people ask Kelly about the value of a 4-year degree, he says it depends.  The recommendation for most people if they have no career path in their current field is to get a degree in an area they care about or that really interests them.   \n\n* If you don't know what you want to do, spend some time thinking about it.   \n\n* Most employers just look to see if you have a degree.  The place it comes from is not as important. \n\n* Take some classes in business so you understand it and can communicate ideas well to other business leaders and professionals.  Many IT professionals do not understand business. \n\n* It is challenging for technical people to communicate effectively with executive leaders. \n\n* John cites Sales training as opening his eyes to how business leaders think about technology. \n\n* Do people in technical Sales have a better chance at getting what they want accomplished? \n\n* Maybe the gap in IT is effective communication with upstream management. \n\n## 14:14 - Paths to Management \n\n^90e9a8\n\n* Does training in business / Sales naturally lead to being a manager? \n\n* Kelly had no desire to go into management.  It just so happens that the technology curriculum at his college was inside the business realm.  He later realized the value of having all the business classes (Marketing, Sales, Accounting, etc.) in addition to pure IT curricula before starting in the workforce. \n\n* Managing people is an entirely different skill than business management.  \n\n* Kelly's original perception of people in management was tainted.  He viewed manager as a dirty word and people in management roles as sell outs. \n\n* He never wanted to be like popular portrayals of terrible managers (i.e. something you would see in a Dilbert comic strip). \n\n* Kelly discovered at a previous job how much he loved being a manager. \n\n* He was hired into a small business IT manager role. \n\n* The things he loved most were connecting people within the organization with ideas and solutions as well as developing the team (which sounds like Technical Sales). \n\n* Solving technology problems himself became less interesting to Kelly.  He had less tolerance for things being broken and having to find a fix. \n\n* There was little to no training on how to be a manager when he started. \n\n* Should there be a John White book on people management? \n\n* Kelly had experience as a technical lead and implemented a number of technologies in previous roles. \n\n* As a manager he could hand off an idea for someone else to implement. \n\n* Kelly was able to see that his enjoyment of technology was not tied to implementation.  This sounds similar to [[A.J. Kuftic]]'s experience as an enterprise architect [Episode 40](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-040-enterprise-architect-mindset-paul-woodward-jr-and-a-j-kuftic-part-2/). \n\n* Kelly really enjoys [[developing people]] through giving them opportunities to do more and improve themselves. \n\n* He wanted to be able to provide everything he didn't have from his management in previous roles. \n\n* What about challenging administrative tasks like hiring, firing, and performance management? \n\n* The hiring process is exciting!  The performance management and review definitely is not. \n\n* In his manager role at the defense contractor, he could influence and fight for employee pay raises. \n\n## 26:15 - [[Burnout]] and The Path to Healing \n\n^515deb\n\n* Kelly burned out while working for a defense contractor (job right before his current position) from taking on some responsibilities outside his skillset. \n\n* This involved a pay raise and a security clearance upgrade, but the next two years did not go well.  It was an absolute grind. \n\n* There were some significant personal issues that compounded the situation during this time, and Kelly eventually resigned from the role at the defense contractor. \n\n* Kelly's boss had told him he needed to turn things around and removed the responsibilities that Kelly struggled to do. \n\n* Despite some stress relief with this change, Kelly decided it was time to make a change.  He liked the organization but hated his job. \n\n* John comments on what a 2 year span in a stressful situation can do to a person's health and mental state and how a change of scenery can help. \n\n* 28:36 Leaving the defense contractor led to 18 months of unemployment with 16 months of no interviews. \n\n* At first he focused only on what interested him. \n\n* Eventually he had to focus on roles that would definitely pay the bills. \n\n* Living through this was an extreme challenge. \n\n## 34:00 – A Period of Unemployment \n\n* What changes did Kelly make to finally get a job after the dry spell? \n\n* Someone gave Kelly advice on how to get past application tracking systems (ATP), but there were not a lot of the jobs he applied for which had these. \n\n* A friend outside the technology space suggested Kelly learn how to better sell himself. \n\n* \"Every line on your resume needs to be something that no one else can say.\" \n\n* Make it something real, and tell your story through the lens of how it applies to a bottom line. \n\n* Kelly felt strange about providing estimated savings or other numbers to quantify accomplishments on a resume. \n\n* Kelly took this advice and re-worked his resume, taking him from 0 hits to a phone interview and 3 in-person interviews in a period of a few weeks. \n\n* Kelly has shared this methodology with others when reviewing resumes.   \n\n* John reiterates some of our previous advice for writing your resume to support the job description.  See the following episodes for guidance: \n\n* [Episode 4](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-004-company-culture-and-resume-writing/) – Company Culture and Resume Writing [[Episode 4]]\n\n* [Episode 53](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-1/) - Unexpected Career Opportunities, Part 1 on Keeping Your Resume Updated [[Episode 53]]\n\n* Updating your own resume is challenging.  It's helpful to get feedback from someone else when you do it.   \n\n* Be sure to update your resume regularly.  Forgetting to do this may cause you to lose track of experiences had that could justify your value to a prospective employer. \n\n* Don't fall into the trap of always thinking you are safe.  \n\n## 43:58 – Questioning Yourself  \n\n* During this time of being unemployed, Kelly began to question his competence. \n\n* When you apply to many jobs with nothing to show for it, doubt creeps into the picture. \n\n* \"Are all these rejections actually right about me?\" \n\n* We tend to form opinions of ourselves based on the feedback received.  In Kelly's case, the feedback was a lack of call backs until very late in the process. \n\n* John points out a lack of career guidance for those in smaller companies.   \n\n* Kelly ended up getting a job he really loves that was not something he was specifically aiming for when he began the job search. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. \n\n* You can find Kelly in the Spiceworks community ([Sosipater](https://community.spiceworks.com/people/kelly) is his handle). ","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-59":{"title":"Episode 59","content":"\n# Episode 59\n\nWelcome to episode 59 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we have part 2 of an interview with Kelly Schroeder about the technical management career and advice for the would-be manager. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-15-2019 \n\nTopics – Kelly Schroeder Interview [[Kelly Schroeder]] [[Episode 58]]\n\n=================================== \n\n## 02:19 – Kelly's Current Role as a Manager - Observations and Lessons \n\n* How is this role different than his previous positions? \n\n* The organization is a different scale with over 2000 employees.  The IT Department is 80 people, and Kelly has 15 people under him (2 supervisors and 4 direct reports). \n\n* This is wildly different than what he has done in the past.  With a team this large, he cannot do anything technical (no room to fit into his day). \n\n* Kelly was hired into this job to replace someone on the way out.  He replaced a quality person who had built a great team and considers himself of a maintainer than a builder. \n\n* Kelly realized the person he was replacing had truly cared about the wellbeing of her team.  She understood them, knew them on a personal level, and helped shape them to be better people. \n\n* John mentioned some of the great managers he's had exhibited the same qualities. \n\n* At Kelly's level, he can know all the people on his team and interact with everyone.   \n\n* Even though he manages managers today, the fundamental principle of caring for his people does not change. \n\n* If he was a level or two higher and over a larger team the connection with each person would not be feasible. \n\n* We're not sure how more senior level leaders handle this, but maybe we need to have one on the show. \n\n* When managing managers, Kelly can set an expectation / vision and ask managers to communicate to their teams, but it's extremely difficult to step back and avoid micromanagement. \n\n* John shares a fun anecdote about how to properly raise a flag in the military. \n\n* 12:44 – John White School of Mentoring Plug \n\n* Pulling back from micromanagement comes down to respect. \n\n* It feels disrespectful for him to do someone else's job.  When he gets the urge, he thinks about the way he would want to be treated and changes course. \n\n* Is managing like parenting?  Listen to Kelly give some great advice here. \n\n## 16:02 – Advice for the Would Be Manager \n\n* Know what your leadership looks like.   \n\n* Some feel leadership looks like a charismatic leader of a large organization (Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc.).  Because of this misconception, Kelly originally doubted his ability to be a leader. \n\n* Kelly took a [StrengthsFinder](https://www.gallup.com/press/176429/strengthsfinder.aspx) training and realized he could leverage his relational strengths to lead instead of trying to be like someone who he thinks is a leader. \n\n* The StrengthsFinder assessment is just another personality assessment that focuses specifically on your strengths rather than on what you lack. \n\n* The episodes on management with [[Charlie Nichol]] inspired Kelly to share his perspective with our listeners of coming from the SMB world.        \n\n* [Episode 51](http://nerd-journey.com/individual-contributor-to-manager-with-charlie-nichol-pt-1/) [[Episode 51]]\n\n* [Episode 52](http://nerd-journey.com/considering-a-management-career-and-learning-to-develop-teams-with-charlie-nichol-pt-2/) [[Episode 52]]\n\n* Final thoughts... \n\n* For those in IT and introverted...everyone has the potential to be a leader in some way. \n\n* Leading is mostly about ownership and vision, which you can have over your own responsibilities as an individual contributor. \n\n* Don't be a afraid of your ability to influence others. \n\n* There are career paths for individual contributors to remain non-managers but still be in leadership roles.  Lack of a role like this in your organization may be a sign it is time to make a move to a larger company. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. \n\n* You can find Kelly in the Spiceworks community ([Sosipater](https://community.spiceworks.com/people/kelly) is his handle).","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-6":{"title":"Episode 6","content":"\n# Episode 6\n\nThe ins and outs of Training: Why, How, What, and When \n\nTopics \n\n2:20 -

In today's episode we discuss career management from a marketing perspective. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-23-2019 \n\nTopics – [[Amy Hervey]] Interview \n\n## 04:17 – Background on Amy \n\n* Amy is a Marketing Manager for an HR Outsourcing company and has been in the field for over 20 years.  Her background is journalism and marketing. \n\n* The role of a Marketing Manager varies a lot based on the size of the company, industry, and what is being marketed. \n\n* In Amy's case, this includes everything from social media platform management, website management, press releases, e-mail campaigns, promotional print items, online learning platforms, Sales support, etc.  She is a one person Marketing department and loves her job immensely. \n\n##  5:30 – Marketing, Influence, and Staying on Brand \n\n* What is the difference between product marketing and influence marketing? [[Product Marketing vs. Influence Marketing]]\n\n* Product marketing is promoting a product or service by increasing brand awareness. \n\n* There is a strong trend in the industry to lean on \"influencers\" to promote a product.  This can be paid or unpaid.  An example would be someone wearing a popular clothing line and giving feedback on positive and negative attributes to others. \n\n* People would rather hear about a product or service from someone they can relate to than to hear from a company talk about its own products and services.  The influence gained from this can often penetrate new markets the company could not on its own. \n\n* This made John think of social media influencers.  We've talked about peer to peer influencing (i.e. users of a business product), but there is also the mass retail influencer. \n\n* Many people are waiting to get the proper amount of information before making a decision.  They want it from someone with which they can identify.   \n\n* Word of mouth is not new, but that's what social media influence is.  It is one step away from customer testimonials but not looked at in the same light. \n\n* Go back and listen to [Episode 36](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-036-customer-advocacy-programs/) on customer advocacy programs as a compliment to this episode.  [[Episode 36]]\n\n* Employee advocacy programs and user advocacy programs \n\n* Employee advocacy programs empower employees to share messages that the employees choose.  It is a nice way to provide guardrails for content and branding. \n\n* Employee advocacy programs really do make a difference in getting the message of the company out to others but with a personal spin. \n\n* A curated message is one thing, but it is important to cultivate a socially active workforce to activate this kind of effort. \n\n## 12:14 - What is a [[Marketing Culture]]? \n\n* Check out an [article]([https://www.staffone.com/developing-marketing-culture/](https://www.staffone.com/developing-marketing-culture/)) Amy wrote on this topic. \n\n* We are all Marketers.  It is only a matter of what we are marketing. \n\n* Onboarding a new hire is a chance to give new employees the tools to succeed and is an opportunity for the employer to make the employee feel welcome.  Providing information about the company voice (fonts, voicemails, e-mail signatures, design guidelines, etc.) is important to keep the brand strong and consistent. \n\n* Placing importance on this must come from the top down and should be evident when employees begin employment. \n\n* Some employees may be hesitant to engage fully with the company via social media.  \n\n* Employee advocacy programs are ideal here to provide things that are safe to post and to provide some guardrails. \n\n* In terms of reactions to brand requirements, it can feel like big brother, but most are grateful for tools to help them get started. \n\n* A corporate e-mail signature is analogous to company letterhead.   \n\n* The brand guidelines and standards give customers a consistent feel and promote trust. \n\n* 17:27 (ish) - John White School of Mentoring mention (Nick claiming to plug via e-mail signature) \n\n* Brands do business via different platforms.  It depends on who they want to engage with and who they want to engage with them. \n\n* These guidelines become part of a culture and part of \"this is how we do things around here.\" \n\n## 20:22 – [[Personal Brand]] Marketing \n\n* Personal brand is a buzz word for showing the world who you are professionally.  Put some thought and effort into how you present yourself, your skills, and what makes you unique. \n\n* If representing your company, some of this will be dictated by company guidelines. \n\n* How do you want others to see you?  What is important to you?   \n\n* Every single interaction whether in person or online has potential to strengthen or damage your reputation. \n\n* Personal brand is a blend of what you are good at, what you have accomplished, things you are passionate about, where your focus lies, who you want to work with, etc.   \n\n* 24:25 - Is your personal brand impactful or just noise? \n\n* If I don't show you through what I do, what I'm consistently shouting doesn't matter. \n\n* Are you engaging with your audience in a way that would make them miss you if you weren't there?  Are you providing something of value? \n\n* Think about why you respect others' brands.  What is it those you perceive to have a strong brand are doing? \n\n* The best thing you can do is get to know your audience and their needs.  Make them feel welcome. \n\n* Help others by helping them build their brand.  Show them that you see who they are.  Be responsive if someone contacts you.  \n\n* Think focused community interaction. \n\n* Likes and Re-Tweets are vanity metrics.  Ask people to engage through sharing feedback.   \n\n* A blog is a great way to share value, thoughts, ideas, and expertise. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-61":{"title":"Episode 61","content":"\n# Episode 61\n\nWelcome to episode 61 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/](mailto:@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/))]!

In today's episode we discuss online community management and its role within an organization with community manager Nic Tolstoshev. Here's the [Nic Tolstoshev fan art Flickr feed](https://www.flickr.com/photos/spiceworks/with/5708561448/) we mentioned.  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-26-2019 \n\nTopics – [[Community Management]] and the Community Management Role [[Nic Tolstoshev]] #Automox\n\n## 3:20 Online Communities and Community Management \n\n* Nic is currently a community manager at [Automox](https://www.automox.com/). \n\n* He has been working as an online community manager for 15 years and worked in IT as a systems administrator before that. \n\n* What does a community manager do? \n\n* They manage an online community, ensure it is thriving, make sure people are getting along, and serve as a conduit for information between community participants and employees of the company who sponsors the community. \n\n* Think providing feedback to product teams, helping engage customers for beta testing, helping with announcements, etc. \n\n* Why do companies invest in having an online community? \n\n* This provides an additional channel to interact with customers online but also a peer-to-peer interaction opportunity for customers. \n\n* Some companies separate online community from a formal advocacy program, while others do not.   \n\n* Many companies do not know where to put the community management discipline inside the organization (Development / Engineering, Marketing, Support, etc.) because the discipline is still fairly new. \n\n* Depending on where the role falls within an organization, it can affect perceived internal value of this role, resources and headcount available, etc. \n\n* When an online community grows up with a company, it seems to be seen as more valuable than a community started by a well-established company (might be more challenge to get buy in). \n\n* At Automox, Nic has executive level support for establishment and growth of the online community. \n\n* Do community managers have social media functions also? \n\n* The roles between community managers and social media functions have mostly diverged with the social media responsibilities being a branch of Marketing. \n\n* While there is some overlap between social media management (i.e. interactions on Twitter, etc.) and online community management, the skillsets needed are different. \n\n* John gives the example of the VMware community and how this comes out heavily on Twitter.  Individual contributors spend time building brand by expanding reach on social media. \n\n* Social media platforms do not support having a good conversation* Social media platforms do not support having a good conversation like a discussion thread in an online community does. \n\n## 15:37  Learning about the Community Management Role \n\n* The transition happened while Nic was at Intuit supporting Quickbooks Enterprise.  \n\n* He did phone support, trained front line engineers, and covered tier 2 support. \n\n* An opening came up in the community department and seemed interesting. \n\n* Nic took an internship at NIH while in high school to write code.  During this time is when he got his first [UseNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) account. \n\n* He spend a large amount of time in this community, immediately becoming excited about his experiences with online collaboration. \n\n* Nic and John spend some time talking about UseNet, discussing how new discussion groups were formed, the number of users at that time, etc. \n\n* Nic refers to [The Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) and the surge in online community interest in the early 1990s. \n\n* Community hobbyist to career \n\n* Nic says it is still fun participating in online communities even though this something he does for a living. \n\n* Nic's mentor at Intuit would say that people are going to have the conversation, whether it is in your community or someone else. \n\n* Companies can engage in unofficial fan communities that pop up organically in various forums (i.e. Reddit), sometimes even offering to buy those communities from those who started them in order to provide a better platform for engagement and not miss out on the conversations. \n\n* Nic uses [BoardReader](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSPT3X_3.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.infosphere.biginsights.dev.doc/doc/c_sample_apps_boardreader.html) as a helpful tool to search online forums for specific content. \n\n* Pros and cons of getting into community management \n\n* You are very connected to people online, and this helps grow your professional network. \n\n* Nic gives the example of working for [Spiceworks](https://www.spiceworks.com/). \n\n* Remember that you will be a public figure through this. \n\n* Hobbyist / online gaming communities can open the door for a lot of harassment.  \n\n* Does this problem happen more often as a community gets larger, regardless of community focus? \n\n* Nic gives a nice example from the the Inuit community and how people leveraged it to further their career through displays of expertise (less incentive to harass). \n\n* Nic shares a story from when he interviewed with Spiceworks. \n\n* His background in IT naturally allowed him to understand the community audience. \n\n* His plane to Houston was rerouted due to weather, and by the time they made it to Houston, the only flights to Austin were the next afternoon. \n\n* He rented a car to make sure he made it to the interview on time. \n\n## 29:38 – Tales from the Spiceworks Community \n\n* Nic shares a story of the photographer who happened to be a lawyer and the scheme he was running. \n\n## 32:41 – Career Advancement through Participation \n\n* Nic has seen so many people hired out of the community into various roles.  He gives examples from Spiceworks and other companies doing this. \n\n* Many vendors end up hiring their customers who participate in these online communities. \n\n* Participation in community is usually intrinsic motivation for an individual but can absolutely lead to advancement.  It's self-promotion in one regard and being helpful in another. \n\n* Community platforms have content changes frequently, making them optimal for showing in search engine results. \n\n* John mentions there have been a number of instances where people have thanked him for a community post from years ago.  Nic  \n\n## 36:28 – The Crossover with Human Resources \n\n* There is little training for the community management discipline. \n\n* Nic double majored in psychology and computer science, which has come in handy in his roles as a community manager. \n\n* You end up being a friend / confidant to people, a bit like a social worker.   \n\n* Nic shares an example of a community member confiding in him. \n\n* Some community management schools of thought suggest setting strict boundaries between work and personal relationships in the role.  \n\n* Nic chooses an integrated approach and shares an example from the Webroot community that speaks to this. \n\n* Herre's a great quote from Nic - \"You're here to help people.  I'll jump in and see what I can do.\" \n\n* John points out the amount of personal baggage that people bring into online professional communities and the way this shows itself. \n\n* Nic has seen a number of support networks pop up within communities. \n\n* Nic loves the job because it is a jack of all trades role with many companies not having a community department.   \n\n* Reach out to Nic on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tolstoshev),[

In today's episode we discuss online community management and career paths with community manager Nic Tolstoshev. Once again, here's the [Nic Tolstoshev fan art Flickr feed](https://www.flickr.com/photos/spiceworks/with/5708561448/) we mentioned.  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-26-2019 \n\n# Topics – [[Community Management]] and Career with [[Nick Tolstoshev]] \n \n\n## 02:35 Community Manager Career Path and Time Commitment \n\n* Do community managers get actively recruited for roles at other places? \n\n* That is exactly how Nic ended up at Automox. \n\n* The career path is all over the place.  Some people burn out after a few years in the role, while others get into community management as a stepping stone (i.e. considering it entry level before making a lateral move). \n\n* For those in it for the long haul, your skills will eventually be required / wanted elsewhere. \n\n* There is not a great path to climb the corporate ladder from the community manager position, but this is starting to change with some companies making a whole department for it. \n\n* A company's having an online community is a differentiator which could potentially decrease the need for head count. \n\n* Nic talks to some things that come out of communities that you never expected. \n\n* Examples – SpiceRex, a special community award \n\n* 08:38 - What about the time commitment for this role? \n\n* Don't make it an hourly position.  There is more that goes into it. \n\n* Nic likes to keep an eye out after hours since online communities aren't just in use during vendor business hours.  \n\n* As a solo community manager, you can leverage power users of the community as moderators to help. \n\n* Nic likes to select an informal backup within the company that is passionate about community so he can take vacations, sick days, etc. \n\n* There is a certain social contract that applies to online community participation. \n\n* Getting additional funding / resources requires showing proof of added value to the bottom line. \n\n* Look at things like number of engaged users, page views, traffic, if questions are getting answered (reply %), etc. as key performance indicators. \n\n* Product feedback can be requested and given within the online community through feature requests, focus groups, beta tests, etc.  \n\n* Nic shares a story from Intuit in the QuickBooks for Mac forum when he helped the product team uncover a bug and had to act as the DeFacto PR person in this situation. \n\n* Community managers have to help keep the public informed in a corporate disaster.  \n\n## 22:47 – Advice for the Would Be Community Manager and Closing Thoughts \n\n* Technical skills won't stay as sharp.  Nic mentions missing out on getting his hands dirty in the virtualization movement. \n\n* He worked on the community team at a company outside the technology space but found himself doing a great deal of technical work (back end maintenance on the community platform). \n\n* Nic recommends getting very hands on with the products a vendor sells and shares examples of what he has done since joining Automox.  This helps members of the community and also allows for very direct feedback to internal product teams. \n\n* The troubleshooting mindset never goes away whether you stay in a technical role or otherwise. \n\n* Make sure you try community management as a hobby first (i.e. a forum moderator) before pursuing a role in that field.  This is relatable experience that can get you hired and shows intrinsic motivation. \n\n* It can be easier to take a lateral move in your existing company rather than pursuing a community management role elsewhere.  \n\n* Think back to [Episode 35](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-035-jimmy-tassin-minecraft-and-building-community/) where we discussed Jimmy Tassin's role managing a Minecraft community and how he leveraged it as relatable experience. [[Episode 35]] [[Jimmy Tassin]]\n\n* \"Community management is the purest form of leadership because you have no leverage.\" \n\n* Motivating people and inspiring them without using money as leverage are highly transferrable skills to any area. \n\n* Further Reading: \n\n* Check out [Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom](https://www.amazon.com/Down-Magic-Kingdom-Cory-Doctorow/dp/076530953X) by [[Cory Doctorow]] that reminds Nic of community management.  This is a free download on Cory's website. [[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]]\n\n* [Clay Shirky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky) has written a number of things on community that listeners may find interesting. [[Clay Shirky]]\n\n* Reach out to Nic on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tolstoshev),[ LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nictolstoshev), or in the [Automox community](https://community.automox.com/).","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.038588986Z","tags":null},"/Episode-64":{"title":"Episode 64","content":"\n# Episode 64\n\nWelcome to episode 64 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss navigating unexpected career pressure with [Mike Burkhart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeburkhart/).   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 12-03-2019 \n\nTopics – [[Mike Burkart]]  [[Unexpected Career Adversity]]\n\n## 03:21 – Mike's Career Overview \n\n* Mike recently took a position as a curriculum developer of instructor led courseware at #Nutanix but followed an interesting path to get there. \n\n* He started off with IT help desk work, which often involved testing DSL lines. \n\n* This led to a systems and networking background.  He also did software testing. \n\n* He stumbled upon ESX 2.0 at some point and got an introduction to virtualization, which was extremely interesting. \n\n* Mike's journey involved him following his passion / interests and making some bets on following them. \n\n* He became a consultant around the ESX 4.0 days.  This involved heavy travel...but not to places you might envision. \n\n* The consulting firm was a VMware training partner, and Mike was asked to be an instructor. \n\n* He said yes and decided to try it. \n\n* \"If given an opportunity, take the opportunity if it is something you can imagine yourself doing.\" \n\n* Mike is an extrovert and stage musician. \n\n* Mike believes we are all here for the purpose of love.  To love someone is to share experiences, impart knowledge, and have them impart knowledge on you.   \n\n* Education is the pursuit of this connection and pursuit of growing as an adult. \n\n* Pursuing this instructor role opened his eyes to a completely different passion.  Ever since becoming an instructor for a brief stint, Mike has focused (as time allowed even after he became a Solutions Architect) on many different things in the education space. \n\n* At one point in the last several months, one of Mike's friends suggested he talk to someone who had an opening in an education related role. \n\n* The person who referred him was a fellow instructor and VCDX candidate with Mike. \n\n* Mike has been a VMUG leader for several years and an avid public speaker.  His current role is a mixture of all the experience he's had to this point. \n\n## 14:23 – Necessity of Career Analysis \n\n* \"I wasn't looking for an employer.  I wasn't looking for a role.  I was looking at how I want my life to operate for me, what skills I want to flex, what skills I want to learn, and what I want to leave behind.\" [[Dreaming in Bands]]\n\n* Mike was in field Pre-Sales as an Architect before taking his current role. \n\n* He did a current vs. future state analysis on his career. \n\n* This process was something Mike needed to do because of circumstances with his employer. \n\n* This is the second time in his career he was being \"made redundant in the field.\" \n\n* In this instance, Mike was given the job of applying for the same / other roles within the company as a result. \n\n* For the architects out there, be wary of the changes you help make within a company having ramifications you may not like. \n\n* Mike believes he took the right role to support what he wants at this point in his life. \n\n* The first time this situation happened to Mike was when he worked for an aircraft manufacturer and was one of 3 VMware engineers in the country. \n\n* At this point in time, Mike realized he needed to lean on his professional network. [[Professional Networking]]\n\n* He was living in Cincinnati and eventually found a role (after 4 months) with a VMware training partner in Louisville, KY. \n\n* Mike was too focused on \"doing the thing\" and not focused enough on building his network along the way. [[Build Your Network]] \n\n* Don't forget to provide value to others, whether it be communicating job openings or something else. \n\n* Losing a job in this way causes one to go through the stages of grief. \n\n## 24:30 – [[Job Hunting]] in All the Places \n\n* Folks in this situation may have to scramble, and it can cause you to reach a very low point. \n\n* Mike has tried... \n\n* Blindly applying to jobs \n\n* The success rate on this wasn't terribly high. \n\n* Asking friends and family about jobs \n\n* Looking at contract gigs (long hours often the case here) \n\n* This requires heavy building and evangelizing of your brand. \n\n* This avenue was too risky at this time in Mike's life. \n\n* Sending out a Tweet to get help \n\n* Mike was looking at [[Technical Marketing]], [[Solutions Architecture]], [[Product Management]], and [[Penetration Testing]] as options. \n\n* If you ask for help on social media like this, people will respond.  But you need to be very specific about how you want help. \n\n* He was approached about selling his lab equipment, for example.   \n\n* Some people approached him about helping them for free. \n\n* Mike learned there are a number of public sector jobs open on [[https://www.usajobs.gov/](https://www.usajobs.gov/](https://www.usajobs.gov/](https://www.usajobs.gov/)), but that wasn't what he wanted either. \n\n* The Tweet had a ton of interaction, and he was impressed with the number of people who tried to help. \n\n* Mike finds it challenging to build his brand. \n\n## 35:00 – [[Keeping the Resume Updated]] [[Resume writing]] \n\n* Mike doesn't keep his resume that up to date regularly and normally points them to LinkedIn. \n\n* At one point he hired a resume writer to get feedback and felt it was absolutely worth it. \n\n* Mike's resume was very business focused (when looking at Solutions Architect or Product Manager roles), but when he applied to technical roles, he was not getting anyone's attention. \n\n* When applying for jobs (even with people you know), the resume should speak to your strengths and be attractive to the people who will read it. \n\n* This is good advice Mike forgot to take when he started applying. \n\n* People may not often look at a resume as if they are hiring for a position.  It's extremely difficulty to do this and may be necessary to get a 3rd party to take a look for feedback. \n\n* And don't forget to put your contact information on the resume! \n\n* If you want to follow up with Mike, find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vmikeb?lang=en) or

[[work culture]] \n\n* When asking about culture, choose your questions carefully to penetrate the rose-colored glasses effect. \n\n* Ask about performance interviews, how they operate, potential for upward mobility, etc. \n\n* Ask about whether people have been able to successfully take leave / vacation.  What exactly is the process of taking PTO? \n\n* One of the reasons Mike wanted out of the architecture space was because of organizational politics.  He does not enjoy navigating the political waters. \n\n* Look for how you want your life to look (traveling, coding, speaking at conferences, break stuff as part of a security team, etc.).  Translate that into current skills and the type of work you can do.   [[Architecting Your Life's Future State]]\n\n* Consider the simple questions about your career / current role such as \"what do you like most about your job?\" \n\n* John shares a great story about an interaction with a recruiter. \n\n* Much of Mike's journey was finding the right questions to ask. \n\n* It's easy to ask about yourself about now.  What about yourself in a year or several years? \n\n* Mike shares an interesting story about leaving an employer that did not value him. \n\n* What do you value when you're working? \n\n* John reiterates finding out if a new job is a culture fit is crucial. \n\n* One of Mike's questions was \"how do you celebrate as a workforce?\"  This could be holiday parties, births of children, or celebration of success. \n\n* Are you willing to trade your life for whatever gain you're getting / whatever you are willing to build with another company? \n\n* Many of the things done in IT are not celebrated like we might want them to be. \n\n* The value of IT is not easily quantified by business people.  They don't quantify it in terms of time you did not get to spend with your family. \n\n* You should care an extreme amount about how you spend your time. \n\n* Is this type of thinking the equivalent of a systems thinking mindset? \n\n* We should make tips for determining cultural fit an ongoing conversation. \n\n## 22:20 – How to Examine Culture before You're in Crisis Mode \n\n* How do we get started when we're semi-comfortable? \n\n* Comfortable is not complacent.  \n\n* Understanding what your goals are is important. \n\n* We don't always think of ourselves as a person in our own lives. \n\n* If thinking about a job change / role change that involves going elsewhere, examine whether it is the employer you work for now or the job you are currently doing. \n\n* Mike's transition to his current role has been the first time he has felt real joy from work in about 10 years. \n\n* Leaving isn't necessarily an answer if the job you are doing is the problem.  Dissatisfaction can be maintained across employers. \n\n* This is the equivalent of having multiple bad relationships that were bad for the same reasons.  It can happen with career as well. \n\n* Great quote - \"You accept the love you believe you deserve.\" \n\n* When looking at transitioning, find something to move toward instead of moving away from something else. \n\n* Accepting the fact that you're unhappy is difficult. \n\n* Positively outline the things you want to move toward. \n\n* Saying no is better than saying yes to anything and everything. \n\n* Am I on a track for improvement of myself? \n\n* Pursue a relationship with a mentor \n\n* Someone you believe you can trust / have a relationship with \n\n* This is someone who can help you grow and reflect upon goals and desires. \n\n* This is easier to do with someone who is not yourself. \n\n* Finding someone who has walked the path you're on is immensely helpful.  Understand you need to provide value back to them (i.e. progress on your goals). \n\n* Find a mentor who wants to make an impact on your life. \n\n*  – John White School of Mentoring plug \n\n* 35:12 - John recommends [The Talent Code](https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Code-Greatness-Born-Grown-dp-055380684X/dp/055380684X/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8\u0026me=\u0026qid=) by [[Dan Coyle]] and its recommendation to get coaching. [[The Talent Code]]\n\n* If you want to follow up with Mike, find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vmikeb?lang=en) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeburkhart/).  He is happy to provide mentoring. \n\n* Remember to build your professional network! \n\n* Don't be afraid to take a small chance that could change your entire world. \n\n* Do the hard thing and reach out. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-66":{"title":"Episode 66","content":"\n# Episode 66\n\nWelcome to episode 66 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode Nick checks in with John three months after his move to [[Google Cloud]].   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 2020-01-25 \n\nTopics – Checking in with John White on Life at Google [[John White]] [[Google Cloud]] [[Year Check In|X Year Check-In]]\n\n## 2:10 - The New Gig and Making a Move \n\n* What does John actually do at Google? \n\n* John is a Customer Engineer, which is still a pre-Sales technical role.  He talks with customers, understands their business, and aligns solutions to help solve technical problems that map to business problems. [[Sales Engineering|Customer Engineer]]\n\n* What would make John want to pursue the SE role at a different company? \n\n* There were some challenges with the Sales territory John covered at VMware despite him loving his colleagues. \n\n* In some ways the change was unexpected, but he enjoyed the SE role enough to consider pursuing it somewhere else. \n\n* What other roles had John considered as being a logical next step after getting great experience as a SE? \n\n* He considered Technical Marketing and Management but had not put a lot of professional development time into it. \n\n* John took time to look around for internal openings at VMware from time to time.  There was nothing that jumped out as an attractive next step. \n\n* A recruiter from Google had reached out to John a while before despite him not looking at the time.  This got John's attention enough for him to consider it for a call back. \n\n* How does John feel about moving to a competitor? \n\n* At first, John was concerned about this.  After the move, he is not as worried. \n\n* As part of the interview process, John did deep dives into the [[Google Cloud]] portfolio as much as he could.  Virtual machines and virtual infrastructure were a small portion of the portfolio.   \n\n* In John's opinion, there is some overlap in VMware and Google offerings, but Google seems to be targeting a different audience.  There are likely more opportunities to partner than opportunities to compete. \n\n## 11:31 -  How is Life Different Now? \n\n* John works with \"enterprise\" customers (which is defined differently by different vendors).  At Google, more of the portfolio is attractive to companies who have never purchased their own servers (i.e. smaller companies with large technology spend). \n\n* John was in a field resource at VMware (lived in geographic region he was serving but worked mostly from home when not visiting customers).  At Google, because of the numerous office locations, employees are asked to spend time in the office multiple days per week. [[Working In-Office]]\n\n* He had to get used to going in to the Google office in San Francisco.  Commuting every day was a big change (45-50 minute commute). \n\n* John had to change his sleep and wake times to adjust. \n\n* John prefers to use public transit and take it during times when it is not extremely congested. \n\n* The Google offices provide meals for employees as well. \n\n## 17:05 - Product Portfolio and Team Dynamic \n\n* John is responsible for everything at level 100.  He is asked to have a major in one technology and minor in something else.  [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) has its own specialist teams. \n\n* Google is trying to be flexible with the greater Sales teams.  In different regions, SEs may be mapped to 1 or more Salespeople.  The company is accommodating a great deal of growth. \n\n* As part of the transition, John had to move from using Office365 to [G Suite](https://www.office.com).  He was hesitant at first but is loving the change (i.e. entire team taking notes in the same Google doc at the same time). \n\n* John spent a long time pondering the type of computer to use (Pixelbook, Windows, Mac).  He started with the Pixelbook and was given the option to swap it out later for a Mac or Windows device if he wanted.  At the end of a few weeks, he stuck with the Pixelbook. \n\n## 23:09 - Advice on Moving to [[Same Role at a Different Company]] \n\n* This is part of managing your career to be portable.  You never know when you might have to pick up and move. [[Portable Career]]\n\n* John focused on being the best SE he could be with a focus on understanding the customer and their problems. \n\n* The skills are very portable (i.e. using public information to understand a new customer's business issues). \n\n* John's customer mix changed at several junctions while at VMware, and he was able to share a playbook for success during the interview process.  \n\n* He is grateful to VMware for the training that helped form these processes. \n\n* Think of yourself as a product to be sold, a bundle of skills and capabilities that describe what you bring to the table. \n\n## 26:49 - Previous Experience with [[Google Cloud]] Products \n\n* John uses the Google Compute Engine for his blog as well as for the Nerd Journey site. \n\n* During the interview process, John was given some credits to tinker with [[Google Cloud]] products. \n\n* It seems like a young and growing company can't hire folks with tons of experience in the product line.  [[Google Cloud]] as an organization is fairly young. \n\n* The company seems to be interested in hiring people with varying backgrounds (coding, SE experience, CTO experience, etc.). \n\n* The [Professional Cloud Architect Certification]([https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-architect](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-architect)) is something John's management wanted complete within the first couple of months of employment.  He knocked this out in early January 2020. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-67":{"title":"Episode 67","content":"\n# Episode 67\n\nWelcome to episode 67 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we have the second half of our discussion with John on his move from VMware to [[Google Cloud]]. The first half was [Episode 66](http://nerd-journey.com/three-month-check-in-as-a-google-cloud-customer-engineer-with-john-white-part-1/) if you'd like to listen to it first (or if you missed it last week). \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 2020-01-25 \n\nTopics – Checking in with John White on Life at Google  [[John White]] [[Google Cloud]] [[Year Check In|X Year Check-In]]\n\n====================================================== \n\n## 2:11 - Changes to John's [[Professional Development Strategy]]? \n\n* Many of the skills we've discussed on Nerd Journey previously like [HR screening calls]([http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-002-hr-and-hiring-manager-early-process-interviews/](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-002-hr-and-hiring-manager-early-process-interviews/)), etc.  [[HR Screening Calls]]\n\n* [Google does a multi-step onsite interview process](https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/interview/) and gave John some advice on how to prepare for them. [[Interview Preparation]]\n\n* John knew who he is and what he brought to the table, taking every opportunity to prepare. \n\n* There was a great deal of room for advancement at VMware, but Google as an organization is pretty young with ambitious growth goals and funding from the parent company.  It feels like working for a startup. \n\n* For example, folks wanting to move into management were encouraged to start having those conversations with their managers since the organization knows more managers will be needed as the company grows. \n\n## 8:01 - Changes to Family Life?  \n\n* John wishes he had heard [[Mike Burkart]]'s advice before making this move (see [Part 1][http://nerd-journey.com/your-position-has-been-eliminated-with-mike-burkhart/] and [Part 2]([http://nerd-journey.com/your-position-has-been-eliminated-with-mike-burkhart-part-2/](http://nerd-journey.com/your-position-has-been-eliminated-with-mike-burkhart-part-2/)) of that discussion). [[Episode 64]] [[Episode 65]] \n\n* John did not anticipate how much of a change consistently going into the office would be versus working from home.   [[Changing Jobs Changes Family Life]]\n\n* The office hours are not set specifically.  Getting work finished and being present for meetings is more the emphasis.  John has seen people at the office at 6 AM. \n\n* John plans his schedule around the food served in the office (sometimes).   \n\n* A benefit of being at the office daily is the proximity to coworkers for bouncing ideas, asking questions, etc. \n\n* For the first year, John plans to be in the office 5 days per week to build relationships with colleagues.  This was the recommended approach from others who were seasoned Google employees. \n\n* Building as many relationships in person as possible is important to John. [[Build Your Network]]\n\n* Sometimes John's wife would work from home, and he used to be able to take a short break to catch up with her.  Being in an office every day takes this perk of working from home away.   \n\n* Remember there is a cost of giving up time to commute and be at an office all day.  Consider this when taking a new role. \n\n## 15:06 - [[Proximity to Management]] \n\n* John's manager works in the same office as he does.  Google seems to be organizing teams this way when possible based on geography. \n\n* John has met colleagues who were completely field facing due to no local office. \n\n## 16:57 - What John Misses at VMware \n\n* That is easy…the people.  He had great colleagues, management, and enjoyed interacting with his customers.  It was easy to reach out to colleagues. [[Maintaining Relationships with Former Colleagues]]\n\n* John brings up a great point - when moving to another vendor, should you maintain relationships with former customers? [[Maintaining Relationship with Former Customers]]\n\n* John did not take the time to reach out to everyone he valued as a colleague to let them know he was leaving (change / move was too sudden).   \n\n* He chose not to take his Outlook contacts with him for ethical reasons.  In some cases he lost the list of contacts.  But he still has connections with many people on LinkedIn. \n\n* How many people make a list of all the right folks to contact inside the current company who should be notified when they leave (i.e. goodbye e-mail with contact e-mail)?  One thing John would do differently is to maintain this list ahead of time. \n\n* Maybe this should have been part of our [Preparing for Unexpected Opportunities](http://nerd-journey.com/preparing-for-unexpected-opportunities-part-1/) series. [[Episode 53]] [[Unexpected Career Opportunities]]\n\n* On the way out, John made sure his customers were transitioned properly to someone else. \n\n* We talked about gracefully leaving an organization in a [previous episode](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-012-effective-1-on-1-meetings-with-your-manager-and-gracefully-leaving-an-organziation/). [[Episode 12]]\n\n## 26:56 - Other Lessons \n\n* John mentioned he achieved his dream job when he arrived at VMware and had to find a new dream.   \n\n* John wanted to make sure he built the right brand so that others would know what he brought the table (skills, etc.).  And he also began to think about how to make his skills portable to other roles. \n\n* Listeners should learn to [dream in bands](http://nerd-journey.com/episode-019-process-over-outcomes-and-dreaming-in-bands/).  [[Episode 19]] [[Dreaming in Bands]]\n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-68":{"title":"Episode 68","content":"\n# Episode 68\n\nWelcome to episode 68 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss situations where life disrupts our careful Work-Life Balance arrangement.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 02-16-2020 \n\nTopics – Balancing Life Against Work [[Work-Life Balance]] \n\n## 0:55 - Intro: A Different Take on Work Life Balance \n\n* Previous episodes on work / life balance \n\n* [Episode 3](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-003-work-life-balance-hero-worship/) - career advancement and work / life balance [[Episode 3]] \n\n* [Episode 47](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-047-you-your-health-and-the-datacenter-with-keiran-shelden-pt-2/) - You, Your Health, and The Datacenter (part 2 of an interview with Keiran Shelden)  [[Episode 47]] [[Keiran Shelden]]\n\n* John got to meet Keiran in person recently.  \n\n## 3:36 - Crisis…Finds a Way \n\n* Providing emotional support for personal relationships \n\n* Providing emotional support requires effort. \n\n* Sometimes providing this support means the relationship changes. \n\n* What does providing support for others take out of you? \n\n* We should acknowledge the effort and be aware of it since it can add to our own stress. \n\n* Loss \n\n* Death \n\n* Both Nick and John have lost fathers in the last couple of years.  Listen as each of them shares the story. \n\n* Regret, guilt, process of mourning  \n\n* Nick had anxiety, difficulty focusing, and trouble sleeping after finding out the news. \n\n* Romantic Loss \n\n* Perhaps the ending was unhappy, but maybe there is a mourning for the good times. \n\n* Personal Relationship Loss \n\n* A sudden change in relationship is a loss (i.e. moving away from a close friend). \n\n* Finance \n\n* A friend, family member, or we ourselves may face a financial crisis. \n\n* It could come from a number of things that have nothing to do with being financially unwise.   \n\n* We need to acknowledge that each of these has an impact, re-examine, and re-align priorities as a result. \n\n## 12:38 - Wear and Tear \n\n* Constant low-level stress can be overlooked as a destructive force.  [[Mental Health]] [[Stress]]\n\n* Few people have a career that will NOT spike stress levels at one time or another. \n\n* Low-level stress can loom (i.e. impending deadline, personal loss, etc.) and build to the point where it affects your mental state, clouds your thinking, and can affect emotional and physical health. \n\n* Beware of hyperfocus. [[Hyperfocus]] \n\n* Stress can be caused by things we cannot control. \n\n* People often focus only on what they can control and start cutting out things that might help like social interaction, etc. \n\n## 17:10  - Proactive / Reactive [[Self-Care]] \n\n* [[Mindfulness]] \n\n* \"Put your mask on first before assisting others.\" - Flight Attendant \n\n* Are you checking in with yourself and keeping yourself healthy when providing support for others? \n\n* Nick is not so great at this one (potential area of improvement). \n\n* There is a \"healthy\" threshold here each of us know not to cross, but we often do if we feel the situation merits it. \n\n* A short term sprint may be ok, but then take time to step back. \n\n* A [[personal crisis playbook]] \n\n* Companies tend to have these. \n\n* It makes sense to create our own for a personal crisis (people you call for support, what to do if the crisis is personal / work related / financial, etc.). \n\n* Continue to keep this up to date so it can be used when the need arises. \n\n* Interesting article - [5 Tips for Dealing With a Personal Crisis or Health Issue While Running a Business]([https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248103](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248103)) \n\n* Avoid time wasters \n\n* John gives a nice example here. \n\n* Consider postponing \n\n* What can be delayed without an extreme impact to get it off your plate? \n\n* Check in on wear and tear \n\n* Check in to see if you are under low-level, long term stress.  Are we paying enough attention to notice this is happening? \n\n* Someone who knows you well may be able to spot it easier than you. \n\n* John sometimes gets into imaginary arguments.  Does that happen to you? \n\n* How is this affecting me?  Am I having a physical reaction? \n\n* Find a few minutes during the day to be alone, be quiet, decompress, and self-evaluate.  It is not fair to always rely on others. \n\n* Can you schedule this time so it will actually happen? \n\n* This is not a passive time to watch tv, listen to a podcast, etc. but an active, reflective session. \n\n* Support from extended personal network \n\n* Sometimes we just need someone to listen to us.  If you don't want someone to provide solutions, tell them in advance you are just looking for a listening ear and some sympathy. \n\n* Have someone play the conversation back to you to make sure they have understood. \n\n* Are you avoiding social interaction and isolating yourself? \n\n* In times of high stress, Nick tends to cut social things first. \n\n* John suggests we decide what is wasted time and what is essential to self-care.  Interacting with others is absolutely beneficial. \n\n* 3rd party support \n\n* Pastoral care \n\n* Most folks in ministry have some experience in counseling and would hold the conversation in confidence. \n\n* Professional emotional care (i.e. a counselor, psychiatrist, etc.) \n\n* Pro tip from John - make it a neutral 3rd party who may not know you well (i.e. outside of the situation, outside of your family, etc.).  You cannot always expect a friend to bear the burden and provide all the support. \n\n* Work support \n\n* If personal life needs to be prioritized over work, talk to your manager.  Hopefully you have a good rapport with your manager. \n\n* Use your best judgement here. \n\n* Nick and John give examples from having these type of conversations with their manager. \n\n* Ask about this kind of thing to discover a potential employer's culture before taking the job.  See [Episode 65](http://nerd-journey.com/your-position-has-been-eliminated-with-mike-burkhart-part-2/) for some great advice on this from [[Mike Burkhart]]. [[Episode 65]] \n\n* Ask co-workers for support also when merited. \n\n* [[Physical health]] \n\n* Heavy stress can lead to sluggishness and lack of energy.  These are the times we need to get more activity to release the stress and gain additional energy. \n\n* Don’t consider this a time waster. \n\n* Sometimes what you need is a break from the thinking and from the emotional stuff. \n\n* Exercise will help re-center you and get you in touch with what is going on in your body. \n\n* Are we eating poorly under stress? \n\n* Be mindful of what you're putting into your body.  Don't eat for comfort. \n\n* Are we getting enough sleep? \n\n* Nick doesn't do a great job protecting his sleep. \n\n* Check out [Michael Breus]([https://thesleepdoctor.com/](https://thesleepdoctor.com/)) and his work in sleep psychology.  Follow him on [LinkedIn]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmichaelbreus/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmichaelbreus/)) to see a lot of fantastic articles on sleep and the affects of not getting enough of it.  He also wrote [The Power of When]([https://www.amazon.com/Power-When-Discover-Chronotype-Lunch/dp/0316391263](https://www.amazon.com/Power-When-Discover-Chronotype-Lunch/dp/0316391263)), which Nick recommended in our book review episode ([Bonus 09](http://nerd-journey.com/most-influential-books-on-my-thinking-nick-korte/)).   [[Michael Breus]] [[Sleep Psychology]]\n\n* Stay hydrated! \n\n* This one is easy to overlook. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-69":{"title":"Episode 69","content":"\n# Episode 69\n\nWelcome to episode 69 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

Be \"At Work\" \n\n* Get in the proper mindset and take work seriously even when working from home or elsewhere (i.e. a coffee shop).  This is not a day off. \n\n* Create a dedicated space for your work.  John recommends a separate, partitioned space, even if it is using room dividers. \n\n* The physical barrier creates psychological room to be at work. \n\n* Arrange things in your workspace in an ergonomically pleasing way to avoid injury. \n\n* Create normal work hours to build the habit (as if you're physically in an office). \n\n* Without set work times defined, you will fail.   \n\n* Build in a break for lunch.  Put the work aside, and move to a different room.  Don't eat at your desk! \n\n* This allows a psychological break and promotes proper digestion. \n\n* Create the expectation that you are not available. \n\n* This is extremely important if you have a family / family members who will be home during the day.  Setting the boundary early helps enforce the fact that proximity is not availability. \n\n* Being an effective knowledge worker requires uninterrupted concentration. \n\n* Plan on running errands during your normal lunch hour.  \n\n* Prioritize work consistently \n\n* Nick likes the [Time Management for Systems Administrators](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Management-System-Administrators-Working/dp/0596007833) approach to setting task priorities (A, B, C). \n\n* John likes to do this as early in the day as possible.  Remember that prioritization takes energy. \n\n* John shares thoughts on optimizing prioritization.  This comes from [Your Brain at Work](https://books.google.com/books?id=MsluGqrSJ6UC) as mentioned in [Bonus Episode 08](http://nerd-journey.com/most-influential-books-on-my-thinking-john-white/). \n\n* Prioritizing takes a great deal of brain energy, requiring access to long term memory. \n\n* Because of this, simplify your life to avoid decisions early in the morning. \n\n* John has done this with his wardrobe, for example. \n\n* Another thing to do is lay out toiletries in the order you will use them. \n\n* Get up and move! \n\n* Wouldn't you get up and use the restroom or walk to the break room at an office?  Your office is not as large, so build in ways to get more movement. \n\n* Lack of movement can lead to weight gain. \n\n* Movement stimulates brain activity.  Take a walk, and let your mind wander.     \n\n* Nick read about this in [Brain Rules](https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rules-Principles-Surviving-Thriving/dp/0979777720) by John Medina. \n\n## 20:04 - Camera On \n\n* John had a sales leader in his time at VMware that required camera on meetings once per week. \n\n* The culture at Google is camera on (whether in the office or working remotely), which was communicated as part of the culture during onboarding. \n\n* This drives different behavior than when it is not required. \n\n* Dressing professionally is important. \n\n* Nick stated he does not turn his camera on for meetings very often.  John reiterates how much the decision is ingrained in culture of a team / company. \n\n* Working from home in a camera on culture drives proper hygiene as well (look professional for meetings even though not at the office). \n\n* John has heard of camera on work buddies to help coworkers hold one another accountable. \n\n## 25:16 - Team Communication \n\n* Working remotely can remove some organic interactions which happen while working with others in the same office space. \n\n* Maybe there's a way to recreate this digitally… \n\n* For groups \n\n* Slack channel \n\n* Group text \n\n* Audio chat \n\n* 1:1 chat with teammates \n\n* John felt like he did not communicate with the team enough when he was on a remote team. \n\n* Nick believes this is fostered by the manager of the remote team. \n\n* He has seen managers encourage reaching out to a new team member to get to know them and make them feel comfortable asking for help. \n\n* Consistent interaction with other members of a remote team is a cultural norm.   \n\n## 30:32 - Document Your Work \n\n* John finds this an effective form of self-accountability.  Many times we forget where the day has gone and forget our accomplishments. \n\n* Documenting what we do as we finish it gives a better sense of accomplishment. \n\n* Keeping a work diary in Microsoft Word, OneNote, Evernote, or within the tool of your choice (format can be your choice as well). \n\n* Documenting major milestones help to show impacts of your work.  This is especially helpful when it is time for performance reviews. \n\n* Calendar everything! \n\n* This is critical when working remotely.  Block to get interrupted time for brainstorming or other focus activities. \n\n* This is another way to help document and look back on your day. \n\n* Could this be extremely challenging for people in some type of phone support / on-call role? \n\n* Managers can help by enforcing time for interrupted work. \n\n* Remember the documentation of work helps keep the resume updated consistently (as long as you do it, of course). \n\n* An interview is a different form of performance review. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-7":{"title":"Episode 7","content":"\n# Episode 7\n\nOriginal Recording Date: 2018-08-06 \n\nTopics \n\nProfessional Networking - [Tech Village #2 -

The Ins and Outs of Training...Revisited \n\n-   This started from a conversation between Nick and John on personal training plans. \n    \n-   We gave some ideas on the \"what\" aspect of training in episode 6 (need to add a link here) but did not address adjacencies. \n    \n\n-   What is an adjacency? \n    \n    -   An area outside of your main focus \n        \n-   Nick shares some examples of adjacent areas under the IT umbrella. \n    \n\n-   Why are adjacencies important? \n    \n    -   Know what is important in the adjacent areas that affect your core competency. \n        \n    -   Knowledge of adjacencies can build rapport between teams. \n        \n    -   Customer example – a member of the development team moved to operations to help improve processes and better support developers. \n        \n\n-   What if you get really interested in an adjacent area? \n    \n    -   An adjacency that's interesting enough could eventually be a specialty. \n        \n    -   Dip a toe into another area without leaving where you're comfortable. \n        \n    -   Knowledge of other disciplines makes you more valuable and better able to support other teams. \n        \n    -   John says \"take their job now.\" \n        \n    \n-   Ideas on \"How\" to train for adjacencies \n    \n    -   Leverage specialist teams to cross-train other teams to a baseline level of knowledge.   \n        \n    -   Train to understand the areas of concern in adjacent disciplines. \n        \n    \n-   Ideas for \"What\" \n    \n    -   We talked about technical adjacencies earlier in this segment, but what about the non-technical adjacencies? \n        \n    -   John stresses the importance for technical people to understand how Sales organizations think and operate. \n        \n    \n    -   Understanding how your boss is being measured helps with prioritization alignment. \n        \n    -   Train on concerns of business executives to better position and get funding for IT projects. \n        \n        -   revenue \n            \n        -   expenses \n            \n        -   risk \n            \n        -   time to market \n            \n        -   quality of service \n            \n        -   Networking \n            \n    -   Individual contributors can learn about managerial skills. \n        \n        -   Helps in getting hired later \n            \n        -   Or promoted in place \n            \n        -   Or hired diagonally within the organization \n            \n        -   Understand how performance is measured \n            \n    -   Most people think about training for certifications or in another area under the IT umbrella.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-70":{"title":"Episode 70","content":"\n# Episode 70\n\nWelcome to episode 70 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss Brad's early career journey that led to executive VMUG leadership.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 03-16-2020 \n\nOur guest this week is [Brad Tompkins](https://twitter.com/BradTompkins_), the Executive Director at VMUG (VMware User Group). \n\nTopics – Journey to [[Executive Leadership]] with [[Brad Tompkins]] \n\n## 02:02 Getting to Know Brad Tompkins - Early Career \n\n* Brad went to the University of South Carolina and studied Information Systems. \n\n* After college, he took a job selling computers, networks, etc. through Computer Sales and Services. \n\n* He stayed there for around 4 years before moving on to [Seibels Bruce](https://www.seibels.com/about-culture/careers/) (also in South Carolina). \n\n* Seibels was an insurance company.  Brad started off in their help desk department. \n\n* This was around the time personal computers were gaining popularity and being rolled out in companies. \n\n* Back then the data and telecom worlds were separated.  Brad saw the opportunity at one point to move into the telecom group and seized it.  This presented an opportunity to learn a new discipline.   \n\n* After some experience gained in telecom at Seibels, Brad moved to Telecom Manager at Time Warner Cable. \n\n* This was around the time [AOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL) purchased Time Warner.  \n\n* Brad was part of the IT Department (data and telecom teams separated).  They were rolling out [AOL Instant Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)).   \n\n* Listen to Brad's fun prediction (from that time period) on the future of this product and instant messaging.     \n\n* Brad had stayed in touch with former colleagues at Seibels and heard about an opportunity to go back to Seibels to serve as Telecom Director.  He once again seized the opportunity. \n\n* Shortly after this, the IT Director moved to a different role (different department).  The data and telecom worlds were merged, and Brad became the Director of Technology Services. \n\n* This included datacenter, help desk, voice, pc support, etc. - everything but developers. \n\n* After taking the job over these areas, Brad had some fears of the unknown (tackling the data side of the house).  He knew voice was not going to win the voice and data convergence. \n\n* The learning curve was steep, but this stepping out of his comfort zone accelerated Brad's career significantly. \n\n* The first stint at Seibels is what we would call Brad's first career inflection point with the second being this Director of Technology Services role. \n\n* There were tons of physical servers at the time (one server housed one application).  The team began testing virtualization technologies in the early days of VMware. \n\n* Brad started working with Directors of other business units within the company, sometimes with VPs or the company president.  \n\n* Brad's focus became getting the work accomplished by trusting the team to execute while at the same time making sure upper management gave his department the resources needed. \n\n* The implementation of virtualization gave consolidation ratios of 20 to 1 or more (virtual machines to physical machine). \n\n* Before this, they were running out of datacenter space. \n\n* With virtualization, the problem shifted to getting more power and cooling for the datacenters. \n\n## 15:15 - A Change in Thinking \n\n* \"You can't just grab the oar and start pulling.\" - John White \n\n* The decision to be in management really came with Brad's move from Director of Telecom to Director of Technology Services. \n\n* Telecom was a one man show with a director title and no direct reports. \n\n* Brad was responsible for hiring and firing vendors but not employees. \n\n* He quickly moved to managing a team of 8.  This involved performance reviews, helping with career path, clearing blocker to getting the job accomplished. \n\n* You have to understand what motivates people to get them to perform their best.  It is not always money and is rarely a single factor. [[Management Involves Understanding People's Motivations]]\n\n* Brad cites [[Work-Life Balance]] as something that was attractive to his employees.   \n\n* Being a single guy at the time, Brad didn't give much thought to asking folks to work overnight or on a weekend.   \n\n* Some people on Brad's team had families and even grandchildren.  He had to adjust the approach for these employees. \n\n* In a crisis, Brad wanted to be the person to communicate up the chain so the team could focus on the problem. \n\n* He knew he would not actually be the person to apply a fix.  His job was to be the shield and keep upper management updated (whether good or bad news). [[Management Involves Shielding the Team]]\n\n* A regular cadence of communication was critical to setting upper management's mind at ease. \n\n* \"Sometimes getting your team access to the tools they need is just playing defense.\" \n\n* Brad said his team gave most of the coaching he needed.  They were candid about what they needed and expected from a manager. [[Teams Can Coach Mangers]]\n\n* Many of his direct reports were more seasoned in the business world.  They told him directly what he could to do help them succeed. \n\n* If you find the tasks you like to do at a certain level within the organization, are happy with your compensation, and enjoy the role, there is nothing wrong with not changing. \n\n* Some folks have the \"up or out\" mentality. \n\n* Someone happy at their current level is going to become an expert at that level.  Pushing them up to something else when they have no desire can do a disservice to the company. \n\n* The question to ask is…where do you want to go in your career?   \n\n* Help the person understand others may pass them as far as level advancement goes (i.e. up to manager level, for example). \n\n* Ask the question again yearly at review time.  You never know when the situation may change. \n\n* This avoids the [Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle#The_Peter_Principle) [[Peter Principle]]\n\n* Being as transparent as you can both up and down the chain is critical. \n\n* Consistency helps also (i.e. updates on a schedule in crisis situations). \n\n* Brad got some feedback along the way.  Listen to his story about changing out a firewall / load balancer and the decision to roll back. \n\n* Brad's attitude and to understand the situation before making a final decision was a defining moment. \n\n## 28:54 - Landing at VMUG and General Manager Experience  \n\n* After almost 7 years at Seibels, Brad moved to Immedion, taking the role of General Manager of the Ashville datacenter. \n\n* This was a 24/7/365 operation in a service provider environment, and Brad managed the teams that worked around the clock, constantly on call. \n\n* There were many international clients to serve, and it was interesting having customers Brad never saw. \n\n* The systems here were huge.  Brad did not get access to the systems like in previous roles (and did not need it). \n\n* This role really helped with an understanding of global businesses. \n\n* Brad will tell you that he is a career IT guy, even after the move to VMUG in 2015. \n\n* VMUG is not a traditional IT job.  At the end of the day it is a community.   \n\n* They (VMUG team) are a consumer of IT. \n\n* Brad was a VMUG member starting in 2011. \n\n* The board of VMUG was looking for someone with IT experience to relate to community members, to VMware, to partners, etc. \n\n* VMUG is an independent, non-profit organization that is tightly aligned with VMware.   \n\n* Members can be end users, VMware employees, or partners.  How do we as VMUG serve all of these groups? \n\n* Determining sponsors for VMUG meetings is done carefully.  Brad shares the ins and outs of these challenging decisions. \n\n* The partner ecosystem continues to grow. \n\n## 36:43 - Assessing Community Needs and Setting Direction \n\n* VMUG is run by a board of directors with 11 voting members.  Ten of those are end users (completely volunteer positions - could be people from companies of any size and any industry).  There is one VMware employee on the board that gets to vote. \n\n* The board sets the strategy for content, delivery mechanisms, ratio of where resources get spent (budgets for in-person vs. virtual events), etc.  That is then communicated to local VMUG leadership (i.e. VMUG chapter for Dallas / Fort Worth or some other area). \n\n* These are communicated as global guidelines based on member surveys and feedback.  The local leaders are able to have the autonomy to tweak things as needed. \n\n* Right now, for example, there is a big focus on getting back to the core vSphere population and helping them take the next step (another technology, what is next in their career).   \n\n* Nashville may decide they are a big healthcare group and want to focus on VDI instead.  VMUG will support this decision in whatever way they can (i.e. by providing content if needed). \n\n* So much of this depends on the local area.   \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-72":{"title":"Episode 72","content":"\n# Episode 72\n\nWelcome to episode 72 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss Board and Executive relationships in the second part of our discussion with VMUG Executive Director [Brad Tompkins](https://twitter.com/BradTompkins_).   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 03-16-2020 \n\n[[Brad Tompkins]] [[Episode 71]] [[Executive Leadership]]\n\n## 02:35 - [[Thinking at The Board Level]] \n\n* Brad has heard it said \"prepare for / do the job you want next.\" \n\n* Preparation for this likely started around the Seibels time frame with access to VPs (his boss was VP level). \n\n* He specifically remembers meeting the chairman of the board at one point. \n\n* At Immedion, the board of directors would visit different datacenters.  Brad would get to sit in on some of those meetings.   \n\n* He would observe the meetings and think about how he might contribute / take part in a meeting like this at some point. \n\n* It was interesting to see what questions were asked and how the CEO would answer. \n\n* Sometimes Brad had to research a specific item to prepare the CEO or his other leaders for a board meeting. \n\n* Boards are very high level and don't get into the weeds much. \n\n* They want to focus on next year and beyond.  Once a year's budget is approved, the board start to focus on the next year. \n\n* Once the execution plan is set, the board does want updates but would rather talk about what will happen in the future (sticking to strategy talk). \n\n* This can be both fun and scary. It is about having the right data to back up your decisions. \n\n* Since the board of VMUG is a volunteer board, it is likely different than the board of an established company. \n\n* In VMUG's case, the diversity is based on company size, industry, etc.  The organization is much smaller than larger organizations. \n\n* How does interaction and reporting to a board compare to a front line / middle manager's lens? \n\n* The front line / middle manager would focus on the here and now (maybe next few months or next quarter). \n\n* The board is thinking of the next few years.  Communication with them is more to determine if we are on track or off track to hit revenue targets. \n\n* We have to get out of reporting back numbers only. \n\n* Steve Athanas is VMUG President and has coached Brad on how to approach and present to the board.  The President's role is to serve the board and ensure they get what they need, helps develop content and agenda for meetings. \n\n* Brad is on the board (non-voting member) but is also on the team.  He has to bridge both worlds. \n\n## 14:22 - Understanding and Aligning with C-levels [[Understanding C-Level Executives]] [[Aligning with C-Level Executives]]\n\n* In VMUG, they want to ensure everyone on the team (down to lowest level) understands how what they do to contribute to the organization's mission. \n\n* It is the job of managers to help team members understand this.  Brad gives some nice examples of explaining more detail about the connection of an employee to the organization's mission. \n\n* Brad has to remind himself that he is not working with IT people.  The person could be an events person or a community person. \n\n* Much of his job is not IT, and he relies heavily on the rest of the team to execute. \n\n* Brad's interaction with employees that have different backgrounds from his allows learning in both directions.  He helps them where he can but takes the opportunity to learn from them also. \n\n* After a board meeting, the deck from the meeting is shown to the entire VMUG staff so they understand the feedback and direction. \n\n* Exposure to a higher level person in the organization is something that helps team members. \n\n* Nick's book recommendation for this situation is [The Three Signs of a Miserable Job](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Signs-Miserable-Job-Employees-ebook/dp/B000UZQHD4) by [[Patrick Lencioni.]]  [[Three Signs of a Miserable Job]]\n\n* One of the three signs is irrelevance.  Brad's emphasis has been on making sure his people do not feel this way. \n\n## 24:57 - Deciding What Is Next \n\n* He thinks right now the next steps are around where VMUG can go and what the organization will do next. \n\n* He enjoys the partnership and looks forward to being close to the future of what VMware is doing, especially after having been close to the technology as an end user previously in his career. \n\n* Brad thinks back to all the people he has met across the world as part of VMUG and the relationships developed. \n\n* The community has to change to welcome the developer into the ecosystem.  Knowing this is a possibility is very exciting, especially with acquisitions like Heptio, Pivotal, and others. \n\n* We need to work on the community.  People are looking for what their next step should be.  There are many exciting options like platform engineer, SRE, moving to a vendor, etc. \n\n* The job at VMUG is challenging and rewarding, and the vCommunity continues to resolve. \n\n## 30:55 - Closing Thoughts \n\n* Be on the lookout for more VMUG virtual events coming soon. \n\n* Events put on hold because of COVID-19 are being rescheduled for H2 of this year. \n\n* If you are not a member of VMUG, get plugged in and [join for free](https://community.vmug.com/vmug2019/membership/membership-benefits). \n\n* Send questions to Brad on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BradTompkins_) or via e-mail (btompkins@vmug.com) if you have them. \n\n* Check out [VMUG Advantage](https://community.vmug.com/vmug2019/membership/vmug-advantage-membership) for discounts on education, certification tests, and 1 year access to a ton of VMware software (for your home lab only). \n\n* Share your journey and what you have done with others via presentations.   \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-73":{"title":"Episode 73","content":"\n# Episode 73\n\n\nWelcome to episode 73 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss the journey to presenting at conventions with Al Rasheed.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 03-29-2020 \n\nTopics – The Journey to [[Presenting at Conventions]] \n\n################################################# \n\n## 01:54 - Al's Contact Info and Background \n\n* Al is a Systems Administrator for a federal contractor in the Washington, D.C. area. [[Al Rasheed]]\n\n* He has been recognized as a [VMware vExpert](https://vexpert.vmware.com/), a [Nutanix Technology Champion](https://www.nutanix.com/blog/ntc), a [Cisco Champion](https://community.cisco.com/t5/cisco-champions-public/ct-p/CiscoChampionsPublic), and a [Veeam Vanguard](https://www.veeam.com/vanguard.html). \n\n* Al volunteers in his local community to give back to those in need. \n\n* You can interact with Al on Twitter ([@al_rasheed](https://twitter.com/al_rasheed)) or check out his personal blog [here](https://alarasheedblog.wordpress.com/). \n\n## 02:48 - A Brief Career History \n\n* About 15 years ago, Al stepped down from a management position at a local grocery chain. \n\n* The hours were brutal, and he had small children.   \n\n* Working weekends was required. \n\n* Al decided to take a risk after getting support from his wife. \n\n* He remained with the grocery chain part time while adapting to his new career in IT.  This helped supplement the difference in pay of his new role and enabled him to get a severance after a few years. \n\n* Al has no regrets on the decision now, but at the time (late 90s / early 2000s), he was desperate for something else (regardless of cost and sacrifice). \n\n* The adjustment to IT from retail was certainly challenging. \n\n* His first role was in phone support working the help desk.  Al had little experience and happened to find an employer who was willing to take a chance on him. \n\n* Al mentioned it was not hard to move from manager back to individual contributor.   [[From Manager to Individual Contributor]]\n\n* Even while being a manager, he liked working with others toward a common goal and did not feel he had all the answers.  Because of this, the transition back to individual contributor was easy. \n\n* Al remained in the help desk position for about 2 years.  When he left that company, his retail role had come to an end.  The next role was working for a federal contractor at the Department of State. \n\n* This is the one Al feels he enjoyed the most and where he was able to learn the most.  The team culture was one of support and encouragement, and it was a place where folks were not penalized for mistakes. \n\n* In hindsight, Al regrets leaving this organization.   \n\n* Interesting fact - Al was with this employer on 9/11.  His security clearance was being processed but did not go through during his time there. \n\n* Al's next role was for a local university that was closer to home.  He was there about 10 years. \n\n* At some point the role began to lack challenge. \n\n* About 7 years ago, Al made a change to work for a federal contractor (his current employer).  His commute is still very short (15 minutes each way). \n\n* Al received a security clearance within one year of being hired. \n\n* There were very few technology changes at the university.  Now that Al is working for a federal contractor, the technologies are always changing, and the expectations are raised. \n\n* John makes a great point about how each of these environments aligns / does not align with how someone values stability and challenge. \n\n* \"If you're ready for it, take it.  If you’re not ready for it, you're going to probably fail.\" - Al Rasheed \n\n* Al works on a team of 4 and supports 260 corporate employees and about 2000 contractors / external clients. \n\n* The month before a semester began was the most challenging month at the university, and the level of challenge wasn't quite there during other times. \n\n* Al feels he became a little stale during this time and is glad he made a decision to change. \n\n## 15:47 - Technology Community Involvement \n\n* Al's community involvement began in his current role.  He got involved prior to VMworld 2017 and won a contest to receive a free conference pass that year. \n\n* [[Jorge Torrez]] and [[William Lam]] helped give Al a chance to attend.  He was blown away by the attitude of this community that was already supporting him. \n\n* After returning from VMworld, Al reached out to his local VMware User Group  to let them know he wanted to become a leader in the Washington, D.C. area. #VMUG\n\n* This move propelled him to new heights, and he continues to give back to the greater community in any way possible. \n\n* John references Al's approach to meeting people at VMworld (spreadsheet of people he wanted to meet). [[Conference Strategy]]\n\n## 19:18 - Al's Experience at the Dallas VMUG UserCon 2019 \n\n* Nick wanted Al to be on the show as a follow up to [Episode 41](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-041-presentations/) on presentations.  [[Episode 41]]\n\n* Why submit a speaking session? \n\n* The exposure gives you the chance to meet people in other organizations you would not have been able to otherwise. \n\n* Al wanted to challenge himself.  This is a priority for him to push down a dynamic path.   \n\n* Despite doing presentations for co-workers pretty often, Al's desire was to speak on an elevated platform.  He initially had fears about being accepted. \n\n* How did Al select a topic? \n\n* As part of the Veeam Vanguard program [Rick Vanover]([https://twitter.com/RickVanover](https://twitter.com/RickVanover)), gave Al the opportunity to speak on the topic of combatting ransomware. [[Rick Vanover]]\n\n* Al was extremely nervous before the presentation.  \"All we want is for you to be Al.\" \n\n* In order to make the transition to speaking at a VMUG easier, Al chose to stick with this topic and extend it instead of starting from scratch. \n\n* When Al's talk was accepted, he was extremely excited to start preparing. \n\n* Nick was at the Dallas UserCon but was filling in for a presenter at the exact same time. \n\n## 23:50 - Preparing for this presentation iteration \n\n* Al did not want to speak word for word and stare at the laptop.  The goal was an effective, polished presentation that engaged the audience.  He wanted the attendees to be able to take something useful from it and wanted feedback on how he could improve. \n\n* Al chose his dress for the presentation like he was going to an interview.   \n\n* Go back and listen to John's soapbox moment from [Episode 9](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-009-blowing-an-interview-and-dressing-for-an-interview/) on how to dress for an interview. [[Episode 9]] #rant \n\n* Part of gaining credibility and relevance is dressing in a way that makes you feel comfortable. \n\n* Present yourself professionally.  What if the audience contained people looking for someone just like you to fill an open position? \n\n* Al reflects on the way he dressed for VMworld 2017 (this time more for comfort). \n\n* Al's final draft of the presentation was not complete until the morning of the presentation. \n\n* Being a perfectionist got the best of him.  Most of it was ready, but there were small details he wasn't quite happy with. \n\n* Al approached his preparation so as to have no regrets looking back on it. \n\n* There is a fine balance between preparing thoroughly and overthinking. [[Preparation vs. Over-Prepration]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-74":{"title":"Episode 74","content":"\n# Episode 74\n\n\nWelcome to episode 74 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss getting feedback on community presentations and the career impact of doing them in the second part of our discussion with ([Al Rasheed](https://twitter.com/al_rasheed)).   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 03-29-2020 \n\n# Topics – Feedback on and Career Impacts of Presenting at Conventions [[Al Rasheed]] [[Episode 73]]\n\n## 01:53 - Asking for Community Feedback \n\n* Al wanted feedback from experienced conference presenters in the greater community to take lessons learned and implement them in his own execution.   \n\n* He definitely received a good deal of feedback.  But how do you decide how to process it? \n\n* Listen to the story about Al's decision to include / exclude a specific presentation slide based on feedback.  It made a huge impact on the presentation as a whole. \n\n* Al cites someone in the community asking him for feedback on a presentation and how honored he was to provide feedback to another community member. \n\n* Presentations encompass the content, the way you deliver the content, and the execution. \n\n* It seems like Al approached this presentation like an educator would. \n\n* Al was very happy with every aspect of the presentation and was overwhelmed by the number of community members who came out to support him that day. \n\n* Listen to the story of what [[Tim Davis]] did for Al right before the presentation because he saw a friend in need.  It made all the difference. \n\n* \"All I needed to hear from them was…you got this.\" - Al Rasheed \n\n* Looking back, Al probably would not have asked so many people for feedback. \n\n* He struggled to keep track of it all and wanted to make everyone happy.  A smaller sample set next time might be better to decrease the stress level. \n\n* John mentions getting feedback and listening to it but making your own decision after thoughtful consideration makes you better without offending others. \n\n## 12:09 - Career Impact \n\n* This has become an addiction for Al.  His ambition is to give presentations in places he has never been and on topics he has not previously presented. \n\n* Al has not only taken this to heart but has encouraged others to do the same. \n\n* Each of the DC VMUG leaders has agreed to present at an upcoming meeting. \n\n* Al has been able to use his experience to influence others in a positive way so they can take the next step. \n\n* Giving presentations on things just outside of your reach encourages deep learning. \n\n* A number of highly compensated positions out there include an element of public speaking. \n\n* John says getting involved in building this skill can be thought of as low stakes. \n\n* Al encourages listeners to take that next step and reach out to someone else if you need help. \n\n* How can I get started on my own to help with preparation? \n\n* Check out webinars and virtual events. \n\n* Get involved within your organization.  Al mentioned lunch and learns hosted by his group for end users.   \n\n* Start small, and learn from the experience.  Then consider giving back.   \n\n* Studying a presentation for the style used, the flow, the progression, etc. starts critical thought about presentations in general rather than the content itself.   \n\n* Many IT conferences have moved to virtual format based on the current world pandemic. There is no better time to do a presentation and study those made by others. \n\n* Most of these conferences put recorded sessions online.  Check out customer presentations vs. vendor / partner presentations to see people who are not paid to be public speakers. \n\n* Al is helping the DC VMUG to stand up some virtual sessions that would enable people to present at no cost to him except a few minutes. \n\n* Check out [vBrownBag](https://vbrownbag.com/) presentations as well. #vBrownBag \n\n## 22:33 - Final Thoughts \n\n* Al's desire is to continue to take on challenges in the community and in his role at work. \n\n* You can find Al on Twitter ([@al_rasheed](https://twitter.com/al_rasheed)).  A DM is the best way to reach him. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-75":{"title":"Episode 75","content":"\n# Episode 75\n\nWelcome to episode 75 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss vendor management as relatable expertise for people management.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-16-2020 \n\nTopics – [[Vendor Management]] as [[Relatable Experience]] for [[People Management]]\n\n\n======================================================================== \n\n## 0:58 - Reasons for the Episode \n\n* This episode was born from something [[Brad Tompkins]] mentioned in [Episode 71](http://nerd-journey.com/journey-to-executive-leadership-with-brad-tompkins-of-vmug/).  He was responsible for hiring and firing vendors but not employees in his role as Director of Telecom but moved to manage people as Director of Technology Services.  [[Episode 71]]\n\n## 1:37 - Types of Vendors to Manage \n\n* Real estate \n\n* Utilities \n\n* Food and beverage service \n\n* Cleaning service \n\n* Lawn service \n\n* General supplier of goods \n\n* Logistics \n\n* Services - legal, HR, payroll, consulting \n\n* Technology vendors \n\n* Special note to the listener - we are considering the scenario in which the person / teams managing and working with vendors would be considered customers.  The reseller case is excluded here. \n\n## 3:05 - What Managing Vendors Involves \n\n* Interviewing \n\n* Sourcing vendors is like sourcing candidates for a job opening. \n\n* Vendors can be sourced through referrals, recommendation in an online community / business review site, or perhaps brokers who will find the best vendor for the job. \n\n* The relatable experience here is maintaining the network of people you trust to source the vendors and interviewing the vendor to see if they are right for the job. \n\n* Communicating Need \n\n* What problem are we trying to solve, and what could the vendor offer to help solve this? \n\n* Hiring managers often look for specific skills (requirements) needed to do the job or qualities they want in a person who will file the role. \n\n* Is the need something essential to the company doing business, or is this just something that is nice to have? \n\n* John mentions looking to a vendor for expertise that the company will not keep in house (i.e. it may not make sense to have an electrician on staff but rather to only call them in when needed). \n\n* Getting Pricing / Quotes \n\n* At some point, the vendor will deliver a quote for services / goods rendered.  Negotiation skills are needed here. \n\n* Is the price fair?  Are all things in the quote needed?  Does this meet the budget? \n\n* In a similar way, hiring for a specific role needs to fit within a budget. \n\n* This goes back to defining needs.  Think of services rendered in tiers (i.e. gold, silver, bronze).  Listen to John's example. \n\n* What are the differentiators of each vendor?  Take that into consideration when looking at pricing.   \n\n* Making a Selection Based on Agreement Term \n\n* There is usually a length of term (one time thing, month-to-month, 1 year, multiple years). \n\n* Think of this similar to contract work (short term) compared to full time employment (longer term length). \n\n* Evaluating Performance \n\n* What are the metrics that will determine if the vendor is doing a good job, and how often will you revisit these? \n\n* Is there a company directive to shop around every year, couple of years, etc. to get a better deal? \n\n* Pricing changes \n\n* Sometimes vendors need to increase the pricing due to increased overhead.  Maybe it's through delivering more value, which is the equivalent of justifying an employee's raise. \n\n* John makes the point that metrics for success (i.e. what good looks like) should be communicated from the beginning of the relationship and reviewed periodically just like a manager would with an employee. \n\n* Similar to this, think about developing an individual development plan with a vendor just like you would with an employee. \n\n* Increasing a vendor's scope of services / goods may be warranted based on good performance in one / a few areas. \n\n* An employee may desire to take on an additional skill / duty (even if they have not done if previously), and continued success through increased responsibilities is another justification for a raise. \n\n* Nick throws out the idea of an [ooch](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/decisive/) (see Chapter 7 from that summary article) and heard about this after reading [Decisive](https://heathbrothers.com/books/decisive/) by Chip and Dan Heath. [[Decisive]] [[Chip and Dan Heath]]\n\n* Termination \n\n* Sometimes we need to end an agreement with a vendor for poor performance (even if the length of term is not finished).   \n\n* Consider the cost of this termination (there definitely is one).  When an employee is fired, there is a turnover cost to the company. \n\n* The decision is on the person / people managing the relationship of the vendor. \n\n* If an employee cannot react positively to critique and feedback, termination is a possible option. \n\n* Responsibility for Vendor Management \n\n* Who will manage relationships with the vendor?  Likely there is someone / a greater team involved in every step of the vendor lifecycle. \n\n* Dedicated resource in the company for management of all vendors \n\n* Procurement - maybe they do only negotiations but someone else manages the relationship \n\n* John has some great feedback on how a procurement team is part of the vendor lifecycle. \n\n* Department who uses the vendor for their needs (i.e. technology team manages technology vendors) \n\n* John has seen a vendor management team as helpful in getting access to company personnel needed for critical meetings. \n\n* This group could be part of the selection arm or could be part of the entire process. \n\n* There are many different models for vendor management. If people management cannot be part of your career path within an organization, consider vendor management as an option. \n\n* Company size (i.e. a global company vs. a smaller company) as well as the impact radius of the vendor (only to be used for some offices in different cities vs. global vendor onboarding) may dictate the number of people involved in the vendor management process as well. \n\n## 24:40 - Ideas for the Resume \n\n* Put vendor management on the resume in a way that draws the parallels to people management. \n\n* Emphasize the process of sourcing (network building), complexity / scope of problems to solve, importance to goals of the business, etc. \n\n* Listen to John's analogy of the lawn service used for your house compared to that of a country club. \n\n* Being involved in sourcing, performance management, and termination of vendors with valuable impact to the business is something to include. \n\n* You want a recruiter to think \"even though they were not in people management, they have the right experience.\" \n\n* If you're a listener who looks to hire first time managers, we would love to hear how you determine the right candidate and level of experience. \n\n* Going through the hiring and firing of vendors [gracefully](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-012-effective-1-on-1-meetings-with-your-manager-and-gracefully-leaving-an-organziation/) and maintaining relationships helps keep your network strong when you're in a bind or when opportunities arise.   [[Episode 12]]\n\n* John mentioned just recently reaching out to some folks from a former vendor of his from years ago. \n\n* Episodes on professional networking: \n\n* [Episode 7](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-007-professional-networking-and-training-revisited/) - [[Professional Networking]] [[Episode 7]] \n\n* [Episode 64](http://nerd-journey.com/your-position-has-been-eliminated-with-mike-burkhart/) - Your Position Has Been Eliminated with [[Mike Burkhart]] [[Episode 64]] [[Getting Fired]] \n\n* [Episode 31](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-031-scaling-for-a-new-endeavor/) - Scaling for a New Endeavor [[Episode 31]]\n\n* John cites some Manager Tools material \n\n* [Using Your Network](https://www.manager-tools.com/map-universe/using-your-network) - Seven Manager Tools episodes which address professional networking to varying degrees [[Manager Tools]] [[Using Your Network]]\n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-76":{"title":"Episode 76","content":"\n# Episode 76\n\nWelcome to episode 76 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss career philosophy and certification, and the engineer brain with Josh Fidel [@jcfidel](https://twitter.com/jcefidel).   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-23-2020 \n\nTopic – [[Engineer Brain]] and a Career Philosophy [[Josh Fidel]]\n\n=========================================================  \n\n## 2:30 Before We Hit Record \n\n* John, Nick, and Josh talked for at least an hour about all kinds of things before the recording started. \n\n* Josh is a #Principal Solutions Architect at [Rolta|Avizex](https://advizex.com/). \n\n## 5:12 - Thoughts on [VCDX](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vcdx-dcv.html) #VCDX \n\n* Josh has considered going for it a few times, but he realized if he can already do the work, he may not need to pursue it. \n\n* He has helped mentor VCDX candidates who were successful in achieving the certification and will likely try for it at some point. \n\n## Check in on [[COVID-19|COVID]] times \n\n* Josh said very little has changed due to the pandemic.  He is somewhat introverted and does not go out much. \n\n* Before quarantine, he had not been to the office for 3-4 months. \n\n* He has many different communication channels (Twitter, Slack, Hangouts, etc.) but does not feel any one meets all his needs. \n\n* John has recently been exposed to [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/) and mentions each communication medium is a little different (built for a different purpose and used differently in our culture). [[TikTok]]\n\n* Our parents primarily use Facebook.  We started off on IRC in the early days. \n\n* Our kids are using Discord, TikTok, Instagram \n\n* Josh had to take touch typing in school. \n\n## 12:11 - A Brief Career History \n\n* Josh has been in the Marine Corps, was a bartender when he lived in Japan, a body piercer in Mexico, and even a cab driver in New Orleans (where his tech journey began). \n\n* In the early 1990s, the state of Louisiana was incentivizing technology jobs, and this is how Josh ended up with a Windows NT 4 certification. \n\n* He built whitebox computers and did some web programming on the side, and eventually landed his first professional gig as a desktop administrator for an insurance company. \n\n* Josh was a big science fiction fan and recognized the dystopian future we're headed toward some day.  He decide to ensure he understood technology to properly prepare (would rather learn to control technology than be controlled by it). \n\n* For while Josh did some consulting and then worked for a hospital in 2007 / 2008 during the economic downturn.  That is where he met two of his current co-workers! \n\n* The consulting company he was with went bankrupt. \n\n* Josh learned a lot about security while at the hospital and did training for Certified Ethical Hacker. \n\n* In this role, he worked directly for the CTO, was the only systems engineer, and built an EMR from the ground up (entire infrastructure). \n\n* There was a team of 10 developers working with Josh.  He learned SQL Server and database administrator. \n\n* The hospital wanted the application but did not want it to affect anything else in the environment.  The system brought in data, ran it through a transformation engineer, and dumped it into their database to be called up when needed at over 140 different practices in the area. \n\n* This is where Josh cut his teeth at being an architect.   \n\n* After leaving this position he went back to consulting. The system Josh had built ran for 4 years with no downtime after his departure. \n\n* John mentioned EMR systems can often be a competitive advantage. \n\n* Think of infrastructure like a \"crystal palace\" that could withstand all sorts of external forces. \n\n* Josh would advise others to get hands on to understand the technology before you seek to become an architect. \n\n* He was an implementation engineer at an east coast consulting firm after leaving the hospital and had to clean up a bunch of messes that architects left. \n\n* After hard times at the consulting firm, Josh was picked up by an even larger consulting firm.  This afforded him the opportunity to grow the scope of the projects in which he was involved (different regions across the United States). \n\n* He spent several months in New York and then Dallas doing work for a construction company. \n\n## 28:05 - Inside the Engineer Brain, Adapting, and Certification \n\n* The engineer brain (the desire to solve problems) is what pushed Josh to new heights.  [Big Weld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFVlyKRVgwg) from the movie Robots says \"see a need, fill a need.\" \n\n* Maybe you start with the immediate fix and then proceed to trying to prevent it from happening. \n\n* People may not always want to be told they are wrong. \n\n* Josh wanted to be an architect to prevent the same problems which happened to him from happening to others downstream, taking responsibility for the problem and fixing it. \n\n* As an individual, a move to an architect is growing your sphere of responsibility / accountability.  Josh gives some great examples of the sphere in different roles. \n\n* A problem Josh has seen is as people advance their sphere of accountability doesn't grow like it should.  He needs and wants the accountability. \n\n* Own your mistakes, but learn from them. \n\n* The change felt organic to Josh. \n\n* We learn from our manager's mistakes even if they don't for example. \n\n* Some engineers / systems administrators may not want to let go of being an implementer. \n\n* There's nothing wrong with wanting to have a small sphere of accountability as long as you want to do it the best you can. \n\n* Josh and John give an interesting example of Cobol programmers and the cycle of need for this role. \n\n* Josh mentions airlines and the challenges of keeping airline systems running.  Does this reflect a problem in leadership or with incentives? \n\n* Josh references [Joe Onisick](https://twitter.com/JoeOnisick) and [[transformational modality]]. [[Joe Onisick]]\n\n* Adapt and overcome.  You must be willing to adapt.  That is the caution for folks with a very small sphere.  Will what you're doing today be a viable technology in 10 years? \n\n* Would we have thought 5 years ago that a Microsoft SQL certification would go away (just recently)? \n\n* Engineers and systems administrators pay a great deal of money for certifications. \n\n* We started to debate the cost of continued certifications.  Check out [this blog](https://blogs.vmware.com/education/2019/02/04/vmware-certification-recertification-is-changing-and-what-it-means-to-you/) and the FAQ on the same page for more on VMware's recertification requirements. [[Certification]]\n\n* John and Josh get into a friendly debate over the value of certifications.  What do you think? \n\n* Are high level certifications making people too specialized? \n\n* Josh cites this as a reason he left VMware. \n\n* Find Josh on Twitter [@jcfidel](https://twitter.com/jcefidel). \n\n* He likes meeting people, networking, and helping where he can. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-77":{"title":"Episode 77","content":"\n# Episode 77\n\nWelcome to episode 77 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss covering global accounts, job searches during recessions, and organizational silos with Josh Fidel [@jcfidel](https://twitter.com/jcefidel).   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-23-2020 \n\nTopic – [[Global Accounts]], [[Job Searches During Recessions]], and [[Organizational Silos]] [[Josh Fidel]] [[Episode 76]]\n\n==================================================================================================================  \n\n## 02:47 - The Move to Globals at #VMware \n\n* Josh loved working with the people at VMware. \n\n* He left the vendor side because the \"this hammer will solve all your problems\" mentality can be a challenge. \n\n* In his current role, he has more tools in the tool belt to present as options to customers.  You can still be consultative while working for a vendor, but it can be a challenge. \n\n* Josh started at VMware after leaving an implementation job. He started as a regional SE specializing in vSAN and was really excited. \n\n* It wasn't long before he was at the top of regional sales for VMware. \n\n* John gives listeners some background on solution engineering and how segments are different as it relates to customers and coverage.   \n\n* Josh liked the regional specialist role because he interacted with customers in Healthcare, SLED, Enterprise, and SMB. \n\n* As a vendor, any partner Josh could train was boots on the ground for him. \n\n* His success came from teaching others.  \"If you share money, you run out of money.  If you share knowledge, it just gets bigger.\" \n\n* Josh's territory spanned Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Northern Kentucky, West Virginia, and Western Pennsylvania.  He supported over 40 core sales teams. \n\n* Josh loved driving and could easily take calls while on the road. \n\n* He got to meet so many people in this role. \n\n* A position came up in the Globals segment, but Josh was nervous about it, wondering if he could do it. \n\n* Josh gives credit to Noel Nguyen as being probably the best boss he's ever had and had trouble breaking the news about a move to Globals to her. \n\n* \"I wanted to throw my hat in the ring, but we're talking the biggest of the big.\" \n\n* Josh expected the customers to be the biggest of the big and the brightest of the bright, but that was not always the case. \n\n* Even in the messy customer environments there were still bright spots (the engineers). \n\n* The culture of some organizations was oppressive.  People were afraid to make a change and afraid to lose their job. \n\n* Josh cites [The Improvement Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Kata) as a willingness to conduct experiments and fail.  The large companies did not want to fail and did not in many cases have test environments. [[The Improvement Kata]]\n\n* Most any engineer would love to have a lab / test environment, but this can be seen as \"just another cost\" to executives.  Every engineer should be able to make the argument to financially justify one. \n\n## 14:15 - [[Advocating for Yourself]] \n\n* Don't be afraid to be an advocate for yourself. \n\n* Once you get to a certain point in your career, you lose the fear.  You get good enough at something in your community / area to not need to worry about a job because you have built your brand. \n\n* Prior to the virus, people were very geographically centered.  Now people are realizing they can do certain jobs from anywhere. \n\n* This is true in technology, or is it true for some other job roles? \n\n## 16:38 - Finding a Job in Economic Uncertainty \n\n* During the downturn, the company he worked for had just closed.  He needed to provide stability to his family. \n\n* Josh was lucky enough to find a job at a hospital.  He had to be conservative and hedge bets. \n\n* Josh Retweets anyone's request on Twitter who is looking for a job.  \"We are job seekers.  We are job finders.\" \n\n* He gives a great example of leveraging connections on Twitter to help someone quickly get in touch with the right people. \n\n* Write some blogs, and get on Twitter to get your name out there. \n\n* Right now people who need work will take something that gets them money to feed their families. \n\n* Josh speaks to the idea of universal basic income and people's fears of COVID driving them into further debt. \n\n## 24:39 - Inside Organizational Silos \n\n* Sometimes interacting with everyone can be a challenge in these environments.  People may or may not be willing to help. \n\n* Companies who can overcome the fragmented, siloed operating model will do well. \n\n* Internal finger pointing is a problem of culture that can impact the business / organization. \n\n* Josh cites a database issue that has crashed a production application multiple times for one of his customers.  The vendors who support various components of the solution continue to point fingers at one another, and he stepped in to help. \n\n* In the last two weeks they have made progress but only through starting with what is known without blame. \n\n* Josh had to change the culture of the calls.  Focus on fixing the problem. \n\n* Find Josh on Twitter [@jcfidel](https://twitter.com/jcefidel). \n\n* He likes meeting people, networking, and helping where he can. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-78":{"title":"Episode 78","content":"\n# Episode 78\n\nWelcome to episode 78 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss burn-out and recovery with Josh Fidel [@jcfidel](https://twitter.com/jcefidel).   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 04-23-2020 \n\nTopic – [[Burn Out]] and Recovery [[Josh Fidel]] [[Episode 76]] [[Episode 77]] [[Mental Health]] [[MOC - Mental Health]]\n\n=================================== \n\n##  2:14 - Burn Out and Bail Out \n\n* Josh loved the job and the work he did within the Globals segment at VMware.   \n\n* The pressure put on Josh and his teammates was immense.  Each was responsible for $15M in sales for the year. \n\n* The sales cycles in large organizations are lengthy, and planning has to happen in advance (possibly years in advance of when a purchase may be made). \n\n* Josh was thinking about what would happen in the next 1-2 years with these customers and not what would happen in the next two weeks to close a deal. \n\n* Everything was more visible to leadership. \n\n* The traveling was so much that Josh would get home on Friday and have to get back on a plane by Monday morning.  It was detrimental to his family life. \n\n* One day he woke up in a hotel room, did not remember where he was, who he was supposed to meet with, and what the meeting was about.   \n\n* \"This is insane.\" - Josh Fidel \n\n* He sat on the edge of the bed in frustration and realized he was destroying his physical and emotional health as well as the relationship with his family.   \n\n* \"This company won't look after me when I am old.\" - Josh Fidel \n\n* \"I needed to take a step back.\" - Josh Fidel \n\n* Josh scheduled back surgery soon after this. \n\n* \"I'm building these crystal palaces at the cost of what really matters.\" - Josh Fidel \n\n* After 3 months home with the family, Josh did not want to go back. \n\n* He got to do something awesome that few people will get to do but needed to take care of what was important. \n\n## 9:52 - A Look at Josh's Current State \n\n* The pressure is much less, and all the tools are in his toolbox now. \n\n* He is happier now and gets to spend more time with his family. \n\n* Looking back, Josh said his temper grew shorter before reaching the breaking point.  \n\n* He would tolerate poor decision making less and would be more vocal about it. \n\n* Other people commented on him being \"wound up.\" \n\n* People don't see these things while caught up in them.  He had a goal and became so focused that the signs were missed. \n\n* Josh thinks he may not have practiced mindfulness at the time.  He may not have come to such abrupt decisions. \n\n* It's much easier to stay up late working now and only lose 30 minutes of sleep compared to having to fly back home from another country. \n\n* John makes an interesting point about western culture and the expected role and perception of men. \n\n* Josh has learned to overcome toxic masculinity by being comfortable with him self and what he is doing. \n\n* Many people have a hard time being honest with themselves. \n\n* Some of the most competent people in technology Josh knows are a little quirky. \n\n* Maybe establishing the brand first allows you to be yourself later? \n\n* Josh is confident he won't have to worry about the next job because he is good what he does, and other people know it. \n\n* Josh is not afraid to speak up if management is doing something that seems wrong and gives a great example of how management at his current employer processes feedback from employees. \n\n* People in management may be slightly more educated, but at the end of the day we are just people. \n\n* Right now people are likely going to expect more from their management.  John and Josh cite a number of examples based on current events. \n\n## 26:00 - The Importance of [[Organizational Character]] and Being Selective \n\n* Character matters at all times but becomes especially important under stress. \n\n* The company Josh works for now has character.  The president took a large pay cut to sustain the company and asked people to take smaller pay cuts so everyone would succeed. \n\n* Josh is willing to forego quarterly bonuses to allow other people at the company to succeed (i.e. so a more junior person does not get laid off).   \n\n* Inspirational leaders need to walk the walk and not just talk a big game.  Josh cites a specific example. \n\n* Maybe you cannot be selective about who you work for today (i.e. an organization led by a decent leader). \n\n* It is always easier to find a job while you have one than when you don't. \n\n* This is about knowing what you value in a manager / company leader and helps you evaluate the organization as a potential employer. \n\n* Great job interview question to ask a future employer - \"what did you do for your employees during [[COVID-19]]?\" \n\n* Josh mentions a number of interviews he had with leaders inside VMware before being hired, which helped him make a decision. \n\n* You as a candidate have the opportunity to say NO to a company after meeting anyone in the interview chain.  Don't forget that! \n\n* It's never wrong to ask to talk to someone's boss to help you evaluate whether a company is a fit. \n\n* Sometimes more money is not compensation enough for oppressive culture. \n\n* Think about the kind of person you would be happy to work for someday. \n\n* Does poor management / oppressive culture / a toxic system stifle innovation?  Listen to what Josh has to say, and you decide. \n\n* People are so tied to their job in this country (job as identity). \n\n* Is the current crisis that perfect opportunity to step back and turn introspective for people, organizations, regions, the world and make better decisions? \n\n* Take a critical eye to what you are, what you have become, and where you want to go. \n\n* As long as you are alive, there are options, even if they are not the best options.  \n\n## 42:56 - Closing Thoughts \n\n* The story of Josh's burn out and change parallels where we are as a society. \n\n* \"We are all sitting on the edge of our bed.\" - Josh Fidel \n\n* Hopefully we all take a step back, looks at what has happened, and makes some decisions that we will make the world a better place…but not at the cost of someone else. \n\n* Check out [Josh's blog post](https://thevfidel.com/ashes2ashes/) on his experience with burn out. \n\n* Find Josh on Twitter [@jcfidel](https://twitter.com/jcefidel). \n\n* He likes meeting people, networking, and helping where he can. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-79":{"title":"Episode 79","content":"\n# Episode 79\n\n\nWelcome to episode 79 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss sources for feedback, types of feedback, and some tactics for receiving it.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-23-2020 \n\nTopics – [[Receiving Feedback]] \n\n=========================== \n\n## 2:24 - Feedback Sources \n\n* Leadership - direct manager / leaders above \n\n* Peers \n\n* Reports \n\n* We hit a wall brainstorming and came across [this post](https://www.talkdesk.com/blog/types-and-sources-of-feedback-in-the-workplace/) by [[Talkdesk]] suggesting additional sources of feedback.  They suggested the following in addition to what we have listed already. \n\n* Customers - internal / external customers, possibly even vendors \n\n* Objective data - metrics used for feedback \n\n* The numbers need some context and are probably only a starting point when thinking of how they measure performance. \n\n* Good examples of this kind of data may be tickets closed, tickets opened more than 2 weeks, or perhaps a customer satisfaction rating.   \n\n* Sometimes external sources are helpful to analyze as well as internal. \n\n## 7:01 - Different Types of Feedback \n\n* Taken from a [Corporate Communication Experts Post]( \n\nhttps://corporatecommunicationexperts.com.au/three-types-of-feedback/ \n\n) \n\n* Evaluative \n\n* This is feedback that gives information on where you are.  It could be in comparison to peers, greater population, objective standard, or perhaps in comparison to your own standards. \n\n* There should be a consistent process to ensure the progression over time can be tracked, allowing the person to course correct quickly if / when needed. \n\n* Appreciative \n\n* This is to acknowledge effort made or accomplishment by an individual. \n\n* The article recommends linking this to the person's values.  This implies needing to know something about the other person's values.   \n\n* This type of feedback can help you understand the value you provide to the organization. \n\n* This reminded Nick of [The Three Signs of a Miserable Job](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Signs-Miserable-Job-Employees-ebook/dp/B000UZQHD4) by Patrick Lencioni and the need for employees to feel a sense of purpose / relevance in their work. \n\n* Coaching \n\n* This is separate from an evaluation and is more of an encouragement or guide toward growth. \n\n* This is not necessarily to address a gap (i.e. be negative) but rather to support continued / magnified success. \n\n* Think about athletic coaches who are always looking to  \n\n* The article made reference to [Thanks for the Feedback](https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Feedback-Science-Receiving-Well/dp/0670014664) by Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen.  These two also wrote [Difficult Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447).   \n\n* John and Nick have not yet read these books but definitely plan to explore them.  And when we do, we can give everyone our feedback on the material.  :) \n\n* Another source we used was [this Talkdesk article](https://www.talkdesk.com/blog/types-and-sources-of-feedback-in-the-workplace/).  They had some interesting classifications of feedback. [[Talkdesk]]\n\n* Constructive \n\n* This is focused on giving the person receiving the feedback suggested ways to improve.  The following subcategories were listed (last two of these were very interesting): \n\n* Negative feedback \n\n* Positive feedback \n\n* Negative feedforward \n\n* Positive feedforward \n\n* Praise \n\n* This is in line with the appreciative feedback mentioned previously. \n\n* Criticism \n\n* This was a type of feedback that is not helpful.  It could be considered telling someone what they have done wrong in a way that doesn't allow or suggest any way for improvement. \n\n* Reflecting on the categories of feedback \n\n* John mentions the engineer brain (something [[Josh Fidel]] mentioned in [this episode](http://nerd-journey.com/engineer-brain-and-career-philosophy-with-josh-fidel/)) and its desire to categorize and deconstruct things as we seek to better understand why something may or may not be helpful. [[Episode 76]]\n\n* Nick mentions taking some time to allow emotions to calm after receiving feedback for clarity.  He references ideas from [Switch](https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Change-Things-When-Hard/dp/0385528752) by [[Chip and Dan Heath]]. [[Switch]] \n\n* Do we actually think about the type of feedback we received when / after we receive it?  Maybe we need to be more conscious of it. \n\n* John gives examples of the best type of feedback he's received from managers over the years. \n\n* Google has an internal kudos system to encourage employees to give appreciative feedback to others.  \n\n## 25:03 - Tactics for Receiving Feedback to Promote Effectiveness \n\n* John cites the article [Barriers to Effective Feedback Conversation](https://corporatecommunicationexperts.com.au/barriers-effective-feedback-conversation/) as a reference point. [[Barriers to Effective Feedback Conversation]]\n\n* Emotions can be a barrier.  When we feel defensive, is the other person intending to be on the offensive or just make a request of us? \n\n* De-escalating your emotional state can take time.  Be thankful someone gave you feedback even if it is not what you wanted to hear. \n\n* Nick references [Chasing Excellence](https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Excellence-Building-Fittest-Athletes/dp/1619617285) by Ben Bergeron and his mention of [Urban Meyer's success equation](https://www.sportsforthesoul.com/urban-meyer-how-to-respond-to-a-negative-event/).  We can control how we respond to anything. [[Chasing Excellence]] [[Urban Meyer]]\n\n* Try to ensure you are working toward growth regardless of the type of feedback received. \n\n* Tips from [[Manager Tools]] on [360 Reviews](https://www.manager-tools.com/map-universe/360-reviews) [[360 Reviews]]\n\n* Focus on the strengths of the feedback. Does doing \"ok\" in one area become a shock to your entire mindset? \n\n* Are your strengths in alignment with the core needs of the role? \n\n* A weakness is really only a weakness if it is below the needs of the role.  It may only be a weakness by your standards.  Would it be better to instead raise excellent category rankings to outstanding instead of focusing on the perceived weakness? \n\n* After John gives an interesting example of weakness in one area, Nick and encourages listeners to go back to [Episode 9](http://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-009-blowing-an-interview-and-dressing-for-an-interview/) for John's view of how to dress for an interview. [[Episode 9]] #rant \n\n* At a minimum, acknowledge that the feedback happened.  It's polite to do this, even if you need to calm down first and then evaluate the feedback. \n\n* Nick shares an interesting story on feedback from a college professor in an upper level math class. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-8":{"title":"Episode 8","content":"\n# Episode 8\n\nTopics \n\n3:00 – How MBA Students Make the Most of LinkedIn  \n\n-   Discussions based on [https://www.ft.com/content/6b28564c-fa13-11e7-a492-2c9be7f3120a](https://www.ft.com/content/6b28564c-fa13-11e7-a492-2c9be7f3120a) \n    \n-   This article seems to be behind a pay wall.  Try a private browser window or a ft.com trial to read it. \n    \n-   John shares the article thesis before we dive into its content. MBA students have an urgent need to find a high-paying job  \n    \n-   Should LinkedIn read like a resume? \n    \n-   Article highlights \n    \n    -   Master the headline. \n        \n        -   Who are you, and where do you want to go? \n            \n    -   Think about search engine optimization (SEO) and make sure you use words in your headline and summary that will rank you highly in any search.  \n        \n        -   Use buzz words appropriately. \n            \n    -   Customize your URL.

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss education, certification, and mentoring with Manny Sidhu.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-25-2020 \n\nTopics – Education, [[Certification]], and [[Mentorship|Mentoring]] \n\n## 1:58 Career Overview  \n\n* Manny has been a consultant in the hybrid cloud (or multiple datacenters) and security space for the past 6-8 years. \n\n* He started a career in IT around 15 years ago. \n\n* Manny has been studying a great deal in the Microsoft Azure space because his customer base seem to be extending into this space more so than AWS and GCP lately. \n\n* 4:41 - The path to hybrid datacenters / hybrid cloud \n\n* Manny started in IT in 2005 after completing a double masters in engineering and science.   \n\n* Someone advised him that IT was a field he could pursue for accelerated career growth, so he decided to give it a shot.  Another person suggested tech support at an ISP or other.  The ISP is where Manny landed a help desk job working the graveyard shift. \n\n* Manny then moved into desktop support for a couple of years, server support, and later into virtualization support. \n\n* In late 2008, he began pursuing certifications and was \"hooked.\"  He now has 40+ certifications. \n\n* When he started the job in desktop support, no one was handling backups.  The team lead asked for volunteers to do this job, and Manny volunteered after only 3 days on the job as a learning experience. \n\n* There was no documentation in place and no processes in place.  Manny had to create the standard operating procedures and write the documents on his own, readying other members of the team to take over in his absence. \n\n* This experience with backups led to getting into storage which led into getting into virtualization, which Manny feels was a great move for his career. \n\n## 7:31 - A Love for Certifications and Giving Back \n\n* A colleague mentioned to Manny that he had done a Microsoft certification and really enjoyed studying for it.  \n\n* Manny said he would look into it but still had not done it by a month later when the colleague mentioned it again.  That was enough to encourage Manny to go for it, and he really enjoyed it. \n\n* Receiving a score after taking an exam gave him an adrenaline rush.  Even when he failed, the rush was there to drive forward and keep trying. \n\n* John has heard people say if your pass rate for exams is too high, you might be studying too hard. \n\n* Manny shares an interview story in which he admitted over 40 certifications achieved doesn't mean it only required 40 attempts.  \"Failure is part of the game.\" \n\n* Nick and Manny compare passing and failing exams to the difference in winning and losing sporting events (i.e. sometimes only the successes are really remembered). \n\n* In 2017, Manny got a job at VMware because he caught the NSX wave early.  Almost no one in his area had the NSX certification at the time, and it made him stand out. \n\n* It's important to \"catch a wave\" of a technology trend if at all possible, but it should be something that excites you. \n\n* You have to try something to gauge interest. \n\n* How do you decide to keep going in a certain area or move to an adjacent area when pursuing multiple certifications? \n\n* Manny likes to pick something and take it to its furthest point. \n\n* It depends on where your interests lie.  Take what interests you the most, the thing you would most want to talk about if given the chance to present on it for 5 minutes. \n\n* Manny cites local [VMware User Groups](https://www.vmug.com/) as a great start to learning to present.   #VMUG \n\n* Nick cites [a session](https://vbrownbag.com/2015/10/vbrownbag-follow-up-vcp6-dcv-exam-section-5-with-manny-sidhu-mannysidhu2/) Manny did to help others study for the VCP-DCV 6 that he found extremely helpful.  This was done through [vBrownBag](https://vbrownbag.com/) #vBrownBag \n\n* Manny mentioned he was encouraged by [[Jonathan Frappier]] to present for vBrownBag, and it was very successful. \n\n* Manny's attitude is that if his presentation could help one person, it has served its purpose. \n\n* Manny has been a mentor for a number of years and really enjoys helping others. \n\n* Since Manny has been a consultant, he has had to pay for his own certifications.  His previous employers would pay for a passed certification (not the failed attempts). \n\n* The raises and jumps in salary since getting the certifications have paid back the cost many times over. \n\n*  Rarely has anyone asked Manny to get a certification.  He has done them to stand out, to learn faster, and for his own benefit. \n\n* In 2009, Manny did his first VCP exam.  Someone at work agreed to grant him access to the VMware environment if he passed, but his employer would not pay for the required classroom training. \n\n* Manny found a course through UCSC that was a much cheaper option (completely online and at Manny's pace). \n\n* There are a number of educational institutions in the US who offer these required  courses to sit for an exam.   \n\n* Is experience more important than certifications? \n\n* Do both at the same time!  Certifications on their own do not carry enough weight.  It does not add up without the experience.   \n\n* Get a job that lets you do the work to get a certification or just get a job for the experience and work on the certification you really want to be able to do the work that really interests you. \n\n* This is more about self-learning and not about a piece of paper (more about the journey).  Beginners often do not see this.  They see only a barrier to interview. \n\n## 24:50 - The #VCDX Process and Discussing It in Interviews \n\n* Manny attempted this 3 times while with VMware but did not pass.  He came very close the last time, spending about 18 months preparing. \n\n* Manny's wife got fed up with him studying for the certification. \n\n* The learning experience Manny went through during this time has helped him talk with customers and certainly helped him progress professionally. \n\n* How did VCDX come up in interviews? \n\n* Manny has had mixed reactions from sharing the story in an interview. \n\n* The thing that mattered most to Manny was the learning process. \n\n* The money spent on a failed certification is nothing  \n\n## 28:58 - vExpert, Mentoring, and Public Speaking  \n\n* Manny is a member of the [vExpert Pro](https://blogs.vmware.com/vexpert/2018/10/10/vmware-vexpert-pro-program-launch) program.   #vExpert \n\n* To be considered for this program you must be an active member of and contributor to the community and provide support and mentoring others in their journey to become [vExperts](https://vexpert.vmware.com).   \n\n* Manny has been a vExpert for a number of years and part of the NSX subprogram.  His blog was what helped him obtain vExpert status in the first place and later helped him break into the Pro subprogram.   \n\n* One of the best ways to find people in the vExpert Pro program is to look in the [online directory](https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/pro).  Contact information is listed for each person in the directory. \n\n* Another way to find people who are part of the program is through participation in conferences and other community groups. \n\n* Following #vExpert on Twitter is a great way to find people and get help. \n\n* These types of advocacy programs are very inclusive and want the program to grow. \n\n* Manny mentioned he even encouraged a neighbor to participate in a local VMware User Group. \n\n* Manny shares the story of a co-worker who encouraged him to do his first presentation in front of a large group.  That eventually led to Manny speaking at VMworld multiple times. \n\n* He mentioned people who came to the session truly wanted to learn from his experience.  This led to engaging conversations and even some whiteboard sessions afterward. \n\n* Even if no one asks you a question during a session, you have this feeling that someone is going to ask a question, which drives you to prepare well. \n\n* The \"[engineer brain](http://nerd-journey.com/engineer-brain-and-career-philosophy-with-josh-fidel/)\" does not like not knowing the answer to questions. [[Episode 76]] [[Josh Fidel]]\n\n* The experience of being asked a question just outside of what you prepared for requires an on the fly adjustment to your thinking, which is very analogous to what people have to do in a job interview. \n\n* Contact Manny on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MannySidhu2), or find him in the [vExpert directory](https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory) \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. ","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-81":{"title":"Episode 81","content":"\n# Episode 81\n\nWelcome to episode 81 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss the joy of job interviews with Manny Sidhu.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 05-25-2020 \n\nTopics – Enjoying Interviews [[Manny Sidhu]] [[Episode 80]]\n\n## 02:55 - A Love for Interviews [[Interviewing]]\n\n* We wanted to have Manny on the show to expound on [a recent LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6660809980800835584-Lt5F). \n\n* He relishes the opportunity to be interviewed.  This comes from the love of challenges and a feeling that pressure situations bring out the best in him. \n\n* Manny likes to present his case in front of complete strangers in an attempt at convincing them he should get the job. \n\n* In fact, his wife has commented that he should have been in Sales. \n\n* Manny feels a lot of people in IT are not experienced in being interviewed and may be wary of it.  He specifically has not had issues talking with strangers in this kind of setting. \n\n* Manny feels he gets more nervous about a presentation to hundreds of people than being interviewed (stays pretty \"chill\" in this scenario). \n\n* Since Manny put out the post, he has helped a number of folks get a job through interview practice.   \n\n* The people that reach out to Manny are looking for some extra tips on interviewing and how they can better prepare. \n\n* Manny's interview tips… \n\n* One of the biggest points is to know your resume inside out.  If you put something on the resume and do not know enough about it, an interviewer may think you didn't actually do it. \n\n* Do some research on the company, including news articles, information on mergers and acquisitions and the role. \n\n* Write the resume in such a way that it makes your accomplishments \"pop.\" \n\n* Make your answers sharp and concise in an interview.  Did you improve user experience, improve ROI, etc.?   \n\n* If you don't know the answer, be honest.  Tell them how you would figure out the answer as well. \n\n* Check out [Mike Burkhart's experience](http://nerd-journey.com/your-position-has-been-eliminated-with-mike-burkhart/) with a resume that was too business focused. \n\n* Tailor the resume to the job.  If the job is more business focused, tweak accordingly with business metrics.  If the job is more technical, speak more to implementing, architecting, etc.  Emphasize accomplishments through the right lens. \n\n* John makes the point that some people do not do a deep read of the job description to truly understand it before applying. \n\n* Without the right key words, you won't pass through the HR filter and get a first call back. \n\n* Manny said he spoke to a recruiter recently who mentioned recording a 60-second video to sell yourself and your skills is a way to stand out to potential employers, especially in a competitive market. \n\n* People need different levels of preparation depending on how long it has been since they had interview experience. \n\n* John speaks to different sets of skills needed for Business Development Representatives who work primarily over the phone compared to a Field Sales Representative who meets with customers in person. \n\n## 18:12 - Lessons Learned from the Interviewer's Side of an Interview \n\n* The interviewer should keep the interview flowing (2-way) and not bombard the candidate with too many questions.  Ask them what they think about a technology and a use case for the technology.  Then probe from there. \n\n* Manny believes hiring managers what to hear what you did rather than what your team did. \n\n* Interviewers like it when candidates research the company. \n\n* Time spent in front of an interviewer must be spent wisely.  A candidate needs to know his / her selling points - ability to get the job done, how to handle pressure, how to adapt quickly.   \n\n* Be ready to address concerns the interviewer may have if you don't have the experience they want. \n\n* Candidates should have questions ready for the interviewer! \n\n* Manny believes a candidate should score a success / stand out in the first 5 minutes of the interview comparable to being drawn into an action movie from the beginning. \n\n* People don't like folks that complain about past jobs, companies, coworkers.  Keep the feedback positive so as not to come across as a whiner. \n\n* Manny does not think there is a need to take notes in an interviewer.  Pausing to take one point down might be ok. \n\n* A recruiter once advised Manny not to read off questions / pre-prepared answers during an interview.  It might make you appear less prepared. \n\n* Body language is important.  Don't cross your arms, fidget, or let your eyes wander.   \n\n* Don't wear strong perfume / cologne to an in-person interview. \n\n* When in a stressful situation, perspiration can activate the scent and make it even stronger.  \n\n* It's a nice touch to send the interviewer a thank you e-mail on the same day / early on the next day. \n\n* Manny has seen this work well to clinch a job in the past. \n\n* Simple follow ups that demonstrate you were listening. \n\n* When Manny meets a potential customer, he has the feeling of being interviewed. \n\n* For remote interviews, make sure you dress to impress.  Clear the environment where you are sitting, that you are well groomed, and that you sell yourself as best you can. \n\n* John speaks to some recent remote interviews he did for people. \n\n## 31:15 In Closing \n\n* The best career advice Manny has received is to give the market what it needs.  Continue to evolve, keep moving, and keep stretching yourself.  Do not stagnate, and go after certifications! \n\n* Manny keeps a pulse on Twitter, follows the right people in the community, and tries to keep a pulse on the technology market.   \n\n* Contact Manny on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MannySidhu2), or find him in the [vExpert directory](https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory) \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-82":{"title":"Episode 82","content":"\n# Episode 82\n\nWelcome to episode 82 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

[[Vacation Won't Cure Burnout]] \n\n* Our discussion is based on reviewing [this article](https://qz.com/work/1660743/going-on-vacation-wont-cure-job-burnout/) from [[Quartz at Work]].   \n\n* Go back and listen to [Episode 78](https://nerd-journey.com/burnout-and-recovery-with-josh-fidel/) if you have not heard our interview with [[Josh Fidel]] on burnout.  [[Episode 78]]\n\n* The normal vacation is not an inordinate amount of time. \n\n* If we can disconnect from / ignore work during a vacation, this will allow time to decompress. [[Unplugging from Work]]\n\n* A vacation does not always mean taking a trip.  You don't even have to leave the house. \n\n* Many times the week before a vacation and the week after are more stressful due to trying to prepare for it and then trying to catch up after the fact. \n\n* It's rare when work does not pile up while you're on vacation (i.e. the world does not stop). \n\n* The idea of not thinking about work while you're on vacation is a good one, but we have trouble turning our minds away from work.   \n\n* Can most people actually turn off work e-mail from getting to them while away? \n\n* Nick makes reference to some people removing e-mail from their phone while away from the office. \n\n* A full detox from normal work routine may take a couple of days.  On the flip side, as the end of vacation approaches, some people may begin to dread going back to the office. \n\n* Josh Fidel told us in episode 78 (link above) that a lengthy leave of absence did not on its own address the things that were making him unhappy. \n\n* Time away from being in the work may allow pinpointing the problem (i.e. unhappiness, other signs of burn out / dissatisfaction with your job) but doesn't actually allow you to fix it. \n\n* For some, their identity is tied up in the work they do.  Imagine someone who is burning out but can't stop doing the work because they identify with it so much that changing does not seem like a real possibility. \n\n* What about unlimited PTO?  Will that allow time to fix the problem? \n\n* Once you're back at the office, how can you help yourself decrease the burn out risk? \n\n* Take small breaks whenever possible.  John says try to schedule the breaks if you're worn down from sitting in too many meetings. \n\n* Too many meetings takes away from being able to complete action items as a result of those meetings. \n\n* Will you defend the breaks if they are scheduled when there are conflicts? \n\n* Do a daily evaluation.  What was good / bad about the work you did today?  Does it align with your values and your likes / dislikes? \n\n* John suggests if you are having trouble completing a task, find out why in the moment.   \n\n* Is there something else bothering you? \n\n* Doing the evaluation in the moment allows time to recognize what is bothering you and to put it on a formal task list to address at a later time. \n\n* Addressing root causes of unhappiness \n\n* This is a much harder task to think through and take action on if the answer is finding a new job. \n\n* Many times it is easier to avoid, distract yourself, or use coping mechanisms (from semi-unhealthy to very unhealthy). \n\n* Facing the issues of what is making you unhappy will be difficult. \n\n* Maybe it isn't work that is the problem.  It could be family stress, social stress, etc. \n\n* All of these can cause anxiety and manifest at work.  Just because something manifests at work does not mean work is the root cause. \n\n* Take the time to address these things! \n\n* Sometimes the work is so hard that you need to take a vacation to face the issues (i.e. reach out to your support network, a doctor, a therapist, a councilor, etc.).  This takes time and energy and can be draining.  Vacation gives you the time and space to work on your issues. \n\n## 17:32 - Ways to Use a Mental Health Day \n\n* We've noticed a movement toward companies giving mental health days \n\n* People are under more stress (financial, emotional, etc.) during the time of COVID and protests on police brutality, etc. \n\n* Ideas for ways to use a mental health day \n\n* Get outside \n\n* Try talking a short walk or spending some time in nature (a local par. \n\n* Check out the [UNC Health Talk video](https://healthtalk.unchealthcare.org/mental-health-benefits-of-getting-outside/) on mental health benefits of getting outside. \n\n* John's wife has created a garden in the back yard.  He's recently spent some time helping her and noticed a change in mood from being out in fresh air. \n\n* Nick mentioned a recent trip on which there was a lot of hiking and time in nature.  During periods of the day when he would normally get groggy, being outside helped him stay energized. \n\n* Spend time with loved ones / important people \n\n* Face-to-face communication can reduce anxiety and depression. \n\n* Check out [this article](https://highlandspringsclinic.org/blog/the-top-ten-benefits-of-spending-time-with-family/) on the topic. \n\n* Even time spent face-to-face when social distancing can help.  It's a different experience than a video call / meeting. \n\n* Social isolation can be draining for those who tend to be more extraverted. \n\n* Spend time on hobbies \n\n* [6 Reasons to Get a Hobby](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/happy-trails/201509/six-reasons-get-hobby) \n\n* Hobbies can help cope with stress and help add to your self-concept (i.e. self-concept will not be just work). \n\n* Nick mentions active leisure time and how this focuses your mind on something else, even if it is related to what you do for work.  \n\n* Reading \n\n* When was the last time you read / listened to a good book? \n\n* [Reading 30 minutes per day](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-reading-books#reduces-stress) has been shown to reduce stress. \n\n* A book allows exploring new viewpoints. \n\n* Audiobooks allow you to consume while doing other things (chores / menial tasks around the house). \n\n* Learning a new skill \n\n* Maybe you're training for a certification like our friend [[Manny Sidhu]]. \n\n* See [Episode 80](https://nerd-journey.com/certification-and-mentoring-with-manny-sidhu/) for the full interview on Manny's love for / addiction to certifications. [[Episode 80]]\n\n* The list is meant as suggestions for things to do instead of numbing your mind with nonsense.  Each of these can provide a little structure to your day. \n\n* John suggests structured participation in an effort to give back to the community is a great way to use a mental health day. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-83":{"title":"Episode 83","content":"\n# Episode 83\n\nWelcome to episode 83 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss the path to people management with [Brad Pinkston](https://twitter.com/virtualgumbo) ([@virtualgumbo]).   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-24-2020 \n\nTopics – The Path to People Management and Early Lessons Learned [[Brad Pinkston]] [[Managing People is a Different Skill Set Than Being an Individual Contributor|People Management]]\n\n================================================================ \n\n## 2:15 - Introductions \n\n* Brad is a Director of Global Solutions Consultants at VMware.  His team is responsible for the technical side of the sales relationship for 6 global brands. #VMware \n\n* The Global segment at VMware contains the largest customers. \n\n* A Solutions Consultant is similar to a SE (Solution Engineer) but slightly different due to the nature of this role. \n\n* Each member of Brad's team has one customer.  They have the opportunity to dig in and build a deep relationship with their customer. \n\n## 6:04 - Career Path \n\n* Brad was an IT Director in a department of 2 back when he moved to Dallas but wanted to look at roles at larger companies. \n\n* The next role he took was a Project Management position at EMC (back in 2007), which in his mind made sense as the next step to create a path into technical pre-Sales someday. \n\n* Interestingly enough, Brad has not hired a SE who came from a background in Project Management. \n\n* The most valuable skill Brad gained from this experience.. \n\n* A SE is charged with leading a team of people who don't report to them.  The SE has no ability to hire / fire those people or determine who is on the team. \n\n* The project management skills Brad learned allowed him to excel in this role when he eventually became a SE, but he also sees successful SEs look at and approach their role as a Project Manager in a lot of ways.  \n\n* \"You don't have to be a manager to lead people.\" - Brad Pinkston [[Management vs. Leadership]]\n\n* Brad then moved into a role as a TC (Technical Consultant) at EMC for a few years. \n\n* He left EMC eventually because he did not want to be a manager within that company. \n\n* Looking back, the management there was just a different style that did not fit with Brad. \n\n* Brad came to VMware for the career opportunities and has stayed because of the culture and the ability to be who he is. \n\n* The managers / leaders at VMware exhibited something different that he hadn't seen which made him believe maybe management was something he could do. \n\n* Brad spent 4 years as a specialist SE and core SE, but his time as a specialist contributing to the team win is what he attributes to pushing him toward a management career path. [[Paths to Management]]\n\n* Brad has been a SE Manager since October 2015. [[Paths to Management]]\n\n* Back in the EMC days, no one encouraged Brad to pursue management.   \n\n* There is tons of opportunity to be a leader without being a people manager. \n\n* Brad enjoys people, management, mentorship, and participating in that part of the team. \n\n* John points out one way to judge an organization is whether they have a career path for individual contributors that does not force you into management. \n\n* The career ladder is not always up and to the right.  Sometimes it is a completely diagonal move. \n\n* Brad wants to make sure his company retains good talent.  If the employee is not engaged and excited, he would encourage the person to find something else at the company (i.e. outside the SE career path) so they can be happy and stay at VMware. \n\n* The culture of the organization helps drive these possibilities. \n\n## 20:25 - Targeting the People Management Role [[Management Interviews]] \n\n* The most beneficial thing for Brad was learning from failure.  He interviewed 2-3 times on the path to management with 1 of the experiences being a massive failure. \n\n* If people management is something you want to do, make your intentions known. \n\n* Until you go through an interview process and make your intentions known, you likely do not have people leaning in to help you get there. \n\n* Brad learned a ton from an interview process that was an utter failure.  He learned a lot about what the job of a people manager actually is. \n\n* Over the course of 9-12 months, he prepared intensely for that next chance.   [[Management Interviews]] \n\n* Brad believes in having a lot of career conversations with the people on his team. \n\n* It's important to encourage transparency. \n\n* Interviewing is a skill, even if interviewing outside your own company.  If you don't use it, it will get dull. \n\n* When Brad told his boss at the time about his goal of pursuing a people management role, the boss was very supportive and key to helping him get the position when an opportunity was available. \n\n* John makes a good comparison between Brad's preparation for a management position and the preparation others we've spoken to have gone through to get a technical certification. \n\n* The way Brad used to do certification tests was go out and fail the certification in order to truly understand what to expect and how to train for it the next time. \n\n* It was a similar experience when Brad took that first interview for a manager role.  He felt he knew what to tactically do as a manager, but that was only a very small portion of what was expected to be successful. \n\n* Many times when Brad has been given a promotion / new role, he was already doing the job.  Someone just allowed him to do it full time. \n\n* As part of the preparation process, Brad networked within the company and gained mentors.  He stayed close to his co-workers, and it was enough. \n\n## 29:31 - Lessons Learned after Getting the People Management Job \n\n* The biggest thing Brad learned in the first 6 months was the [[importance of hiring]].   \n\n* He rushed that first hire and did not have his process honed. \n\n* Brad's philosophy is trust but verify.  His people are the experts. \n\n* Now he understands why the interview process can be brutal (level of effort, emotional impact, etc.).  This was not something he was prepared for until it happened. \n\n* John makes the point that most people don't understand why the hiring process can be so brutal (for interviewers, candidates, recruiters, etc.) at large companies. \n\n* Brad points out two big pieces of the interview process we need to understand. \n\n* You wouldn't have made it deep into the hiring process if you couldn't do the job.  The person that gets the job is the person best fit for the unique situation (the right fit for the team, the relationship with the customers to be supported, etc.). \n\n* \"Just because you were not awarded the job, it doesn't mean anyone on that hiring team thinks you can't do it.\" \n\n* Leading a team is very crucial.  Everyone has to be invested in the greater success of the team. \n\n* Brad's process for SEs includes the salespeople candidates would be paired with, the Sales Manager you will be paired with, and other SEs on the team. \n\n* If those people are invested in picking you, they will be invested in your success and want you to do well. \n\n* It takes time to align schedules of all these individuals. \n\n* Smaller companies likely have a shorter process since the organization is not so \"matrixed.\" \n\n## 38:22 - Encouraging Others to Pursue Management as a Career Path  \n\n* Brad feels his role as a manager is to empower the individual development plan that someone has put together and help the person make it happen. \n\n* Brad would not encourage someone to go into management unless an employee expressed interest in it to him.  He would then help that employee put together a plan. \n\n* Brad would encourage talking to others about their journey to management. \n\n* Some things that may go into the plan could be training, brand building, opportunities to showcase doing the job before it's actually yours. \n\n* When moving from individual contributor to your first management job, it is better for your job if you are hand picked because of certain skills people know you possess / other things they know about you (brand awareness). \n\n* One of the reasons Brad was picked for the Globals role was due to his experience with process improvement / best practices implementation.  Someone told his current boss he would be a good option for the role. \n\n* The employee would build the plan and then give Brad tasks to go do to help empower the employee's journey. \n\n* We need to find what we want in our career and chase after it.  Brad would tell you he's here to help as a manager, but if you don't know where you want the finish line to be, he isn't sure how to help you lay out the path. \n\n* John sees Brad's process as cultivating an open and honest relationship between manager and employee. \n\n* After being in the new role for 9 weeks at the time of recording, Brad is delaying career development conversations with his employees for a few months to help cultivate a relationship because he takes them so seriously. \n\n* Brad likes to have career conversations with employees every 6 weeks outside the normal 1-1s.  These conversations include career goals as well as compensation goals. \n\n* Nick speaks to some of the career conversations he had with Brad while working for him. \n\n## 47:28 - Making Yourself Known in the Management Chain \n\n* When talking about brand, it is a little like a net promoter score.  Usually you are dealing with a lack of brand as opposed to a negative brand. [[Building a Brand]]\n\n* What do you feel other people think of when they hear your name?  What do you want them to think of when they hear it?  What do you want them to think your career goals are? \n\n* Moving from neutral to positive from a brand standpoint is not that difficult if you've done the work. \n\n* If you want to be a thought leader, what thought leadership initiatives have you taken on to be recognized as a thought leader? \n\n* Many people don't know what they want their brand to be.  By not knowing when asked, someone like Brad doesn't have to point out that you don't know.  It actually helps to identify what you need to do for career development. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. ","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-84":{"title":"Episode 84","content":"\n# Episode 84\n\nWelcome to episode 84 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss interviewing for management positions and management transitions with [Brad Pinkston](https://twitter.com/virtualgumbo) ([@virtualgumbo]).   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 06-24-2020 \n\n[It's Me Austin!]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNgxyL5zEAk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNgxyL5zEAk)) \n\nTopics – [[Management Interviews]] and Transitions with [[Brad Pinkston]] [[Episode 83]]\n\n================================================================= \n\n## 2:31 - Making Yourself Known in the Management Chain \n\n* Instead of Brad telling an employee what his boss might think, he asks the employee what they want their skip level to think. \n\n* It's a great way to help someone figure out where their gaps might be. \n\n* John speaks to the idea of mapping out an organization and understanding what is important to the person in each role.  This works well to expose gaps and is a good exercise for anyone to become more relevant. \n\n## 5:31 - Differences in the Interview Process for Managers \n\n* The first management job Brad interviewed for was his dream job.  He was devastated when he didn't get it. \n\n* The strategy for treating interviewing like you would a certification test did not evolve until later in Brad's career. \n\n* It developed quickly when he saw the gaps. \n\n* If you're an individual contributor, the next dream job will likely come up sooner as there are more individual contributor jobs than manager jobs. \n\n* In the lens of gaining experience interviewing, don't pick a bunch of jobs at the company you really want to work for to use as training.  Likely you won't get many more interviews at a company after saying no to them multiple times. \n\n* Nick floats the idea of asking others who are managers to mock interview you for a manager role. \n\n* Brad has helped set this up for someone on his team right now who has shown interest.  The person is interviewing with Brad's boss and some other leaders to gain experience. \n\n* It seems like people in higher places are willing to offer time to help develop talent within the organization. \n\n## 10:25 - Transitioning to a New Manager \n\n* Brad has changed managers twice in the last year.   \n\n* As an individual contributor, he had 4 bosses in 4 years.  In 5 years as a manager, he's had 5 bosses. \n\n* If your manager is changing, it could be a sign that the company is growing.   \n\n* Brad found a way to turn this into a good thing.  \n\n* He likes to treat this change the same way he would want a new direct report to treat it. \n\n* What do you want to do, what are you good at, and how do you like to be communicated with? \n\n* One of the first questions Brad asks is about how the person likes to be communicated with? \n\n* Some people expect video on for virtual conferencing, for example. \n\n* This is a good ice breaker and shows the manager that the employee is trying to make it easy for the manager to adapt. \n\n* The faster the relationship can be productive, the better it is for everyone. \n\n* A change in manager is a good time to not be so humble.  Talk about some of the good things you have done so the boss knows you're confident. \n\n* \"A confident SE is a good SE.\" \n\n* This helps the manager understand what you're good at and the type of work you really like to do. \n\n* Take the opportunity to set the stage instead of waiting for it to be set for you. \n\n## 16:29 - Layers of Transitions in Brad's Move to Globals \n\n* Brad gives a shout out to his former manager, Yvette Edwards, for all the support when he wanted to pursue the change. \n\n* He's been lucky enough to have that type of experience every time he has wanted to make a change. \n\n* It was very hard for Brad to leave his existing team.  Without the support of his manager at the time, it would have been even more difficult. \n\n* Good managers are going to encourage your career mobility…even if it causes the manager short-term pain. \n\n* Listen to the best advice Brad has ever received from a manager and the story surrounding it. \n\n* Brad realized the team was not going to collapse if he left.  It created an opportunity for someone else. \n\n* Brad learned when he first started in management that he needed to trust and have confidence in the people who picked him that his skillset was right for the job.   \n\n* People management is just solving problems, which is what we do as engineers. \n\n* Assess the current state, figure out what the future state needs to be, and put together a plan to get to future state.  That is the way Brad tackled the move, and he is continuing to execute on the plan…even with current circumstances around COVID. \n\n* Stay the course, lead the team, and celebrate the wins (even small ones). \n\n* It wasn't a big transition because Brad just tried to fix the problems.   \n\n* Brad took over management of a team of people he didn't know / had not managed during the time of COVID. \n\n* He's tried to prioritize 1-1s with video on each time. \n\n* This team of people Brad is managing was newly formed (taken from other teams to create a new team).  The people on his team didn't even know each other in the beginning. \n\n* Brad had to focus on team collaboration / team building than his collaboration with the team.  He had an incorrect assessment of current state in the early stages and had to modify the plan.  \n\n* To add to the challenges Brad was presented, his new team happens to be spread across the United States (people in Pacific, Central, and Eastern time zones). \n\n* It's been important for Brad to start his day at 7 AM and not end until 7 PM to be involved, support the team, and build relationships. \n\n* Before our interview, Brad was on a call that did not end until 7 PM Central. \n\n* John comments on getting used to consistent camera-on meetings when making a move to Google. \n\n* Building new teams, growing teams, and taking over troubled teams are likely all experiences a manager would want to have as part of their career. \n\n* John speaks to handling greenfield accounts at Google instead of accounts who were already customers like at VMware.   \n\n* Brad mentions the relatable experience that can help here (take a tool used before and tweak it for the situation). \n\n* John mentions letting go of being perfect, and Nick chimes in with an experience along those lines. \n\n* Brad also had to adapt to being on a new team of peers. \n\n* He was new to a group of peers (which was also a new team that was forming). \n\n* Brad's boss was also new to managing the team Brad transitioned to in Globals. \n\n* Brad needed to balance being new and sharing previous experiences with his teammates. \n\n* The dynamic of the team was a little different, and Brad had to adapt quickly.  \n\n* Brad knew a few of his teammates (at least somewhat) before making the move to this new team. \n\n## 39:28 - The Difficulty in the Decision \n\n* If you don't acknowledge some fears and doubts in making a move like this, you are lying to yourself. \n\n* Brad was not afraid of whether he could do the job and felt like he understood the expectations. \n\n* Will what you learned in the hiring process hold up after you make the change? \n\n* Sometimes a mismatch here can impact success in a major way. \n\n* Brad felt the change would inspire a renewed energy and help build his brand.  This outweighed the fear of the unknown. \n\n* The emotion of leaving a team that he built was even more difficult than the fear of the unknown. \n\n* \"I love these folks.  I love this team.  That was what held me back.\"   \n\n* You cannot always allow this to prevent making a decision to further your career, and Brad wasn't really leaving those people behind (still at same company). \n\n* Closing thoughts: \n\n* Decide what you want to do, make sure people know about it, and don't be afraid to be bold in figuring out what to do. \n\n* Go with your gut, and go for what you want. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-85":{"title":"Episode 85","content":"\n# Episode 85\n\nWelcome to episode 85 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss Impostor Syndrome, Anxiety, and Listening with Cody de Arkland.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-05-2020 \n\n# Topics – Impostor Syndrome, Anxiety, and Listening [[Cody de Arkland]] [[Impostor Syndrome]] [[Anxiety]] \n \n\n## 2:20 - Intro to Cody \n\n* Cody is in Technical Marketing for [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/). #HashiCorp \n\n* Cody creates technical content to educate folks on a specific product / set of products. \n\n* He was in Technical Marketing at VMware before this and also worked previously as a Solution Engineer (SE). \n\n* Tech Marketing has broad strokes, and Cody has been given the freedom to choose the content he will build and the way it is presented rather than being forced to write whitepapers all day. \n\n* Sharing the strategy behind his content creation is effective when speaking to leadership. \n\n* The level of customer engagement is less than when he was a SE, but he's usually brought in for broader conversations (i.e. where do we start / how do we solve problems with the product).   \n\n* Most customer-facing activities are paired with a SE. \n\n## 7:13 - Career History \n\n* Cody floats the concept of being accidentally in a place and feels like some of the most interesting career stories happen this way. \n\n* In his twenties, Cody worked for Verizon Wireless, and a friend told him about a contract job at Pacific Gas and Electric (PG\u0026E) that could lead to a full time position. \n\n* He started as a help desk technician and looked forward to the day he would become a full-time employee.  At first Cody thought he could someday be an internal product manager for wireless products. \n\n* \"You build your definition of who you are based on your previous experiences.\" - Cody de Arkland \n\n* Things changed, and Cody got into the security space and was an Internal Product Manager for [RSA SecureID](https://www.rsa.com/en-us/products/rsa-securid-suite).  This is not the same as doing the same job at a vendor.  He worked with the vendor and managed relationship and looked at ways to grow the product internally. \n\n* After getting involved with the remote access team he started working with Citrix and had the chance to refresh the infrastructure. \n\n* At this point someone spoke up for his abilities, confirming Cody could handle the new project to build a new architecture and implement it. \n\n* This involved building from the ground up - developing the architecture, learning about storage, administering the solution end-to-end. \n\n* Around year 4 at the company, Cody's reputation as an automation subject matter expert gave him the opportunity to be the Windows guy on the private cloud team. \n\n* This was a much larger transition for Cody.  He learned to chain automation together, and the world got way bigger, leading him to become the person who owned automation of infrastructure at his company. \n\n* At some point Cody had an opportunity to speak at [VMworld](https://www.vmworld.com/en/index.html) in 4 different sessions in various capacities with one of them being solely about his work at PG\u0026E. \n\n* He remembers the feeling of presenting something and watching lightbulbs go off.  You see people building their own ideas based on the discussion.   \n\n* \" I don't want people to do what I did.  I want to give you the path to figure out what you're going to do next with it.\" \n\n* Cody was hooked on the feeling.  He felt like he could become a technologist within the power company who did the speaking thing.   \n\n* Ultimately the company needed more of a power company guy.  The project ended, and Cody's team was broken up. \n\n* Once this happened things were not the same.  Despite his leadership being very supportive of his speaking efforts, at the end of the day, it was a power company. \n\n* The next year at VMworld he saw a session with [[Anthony Burke]] and one other on Power NSX.  The presenters had built the framework from the ground up. \n\n* Cody had a feeling of \"that's what I want to do.  I want to go work at VMware.\"  He did not know how or what it would look like but knew it was what he wanted. \n\n* He started by reaching out to some folks internal to VMware for advice and applied for a SE role in Sacremento.  He got the job. \n\n* No excitement matched the feeling of starting as a SE at VMware. \n\n* Cody felt he was not a great SE and struggled with how actions translate to revenue. \n\n* People underestimate what it's like to move from a customer to a vendor.   \n\n* John spoke some training received while at VMware that would have helped him be a better IT Administrator in his past experience. \n\n* For Cody, the act of coming from being a top 5% employee at a power company to being a technical generalist SE (without an automation focus) and carrying a quota became a stressor. \n\n* With no guidance on this beforehand, Cody had some issues. \n\n* When the numbers are not hit, it makes you feel like you missed the mark. \n\n* If you're failing technical validation, maybe there is a problem. \n\n## 21:50 - Impostor Syndrome and Vulnerability \n\n* During the role as a SE is when Cody was hit with impostor syndrome, but at the time he didn't know what to call it. \n\n* He began to think he should have \"stayed in his lane\" and stayed with the power company. \n\n* The roller coaster continued for about a year. \n\n* When Cody got into automation conversations he felt more confident. \n\n* Cody's advice - \"Identify the things that excite you and the places your confidence comes from, and build on those.\" \n\n* Find the things you are good at that make you feel good.  Let that be the foundation, or you will crumble. \n\n* Be aware of what the foundation is and the ramifications of completely rebuilding it. \n\n* It's one thing to go learn a new skill and try a different career path, but your confidence will be built from the ground up.  Give yourself some room to not be confident if this is the case. \n\n* John comments on the talent market for certain roles like Sales Engineering and lack of a formal check-in for people making a transition to this type of role. \n\n* People making that transition need to watch themselves.  It’s important to have a trusted person for support. \n\n* It took Cody a while to find who that was for him. \n\n* Leaving one life for another because of a career change may mean the people you used to work with cannot identify with your new struggles.  Their knowledge of you was based on what they experienced from you. \n\n* Be aware of who you are, and keep listening to yourself.  There must be a trusted person that allows you to be your most vulnerable self. \n\n* Being vulnerable is a struggle for many of us.  People might not know how to respond in the way you need them to respond. \n\n* If there's one thing to be selfish about, it's what you need at your weakest point.   \n\n* Be aware of going to people who support you in the way you need to be supported. \n\n* Communities are not always setup in ways that encourage this. \n\n* John speaks to toxic masculinity and how this affects our ability to be vulnerable. \n\n* Nick makes the point that we don't want our managers to think we are complete head cases. \n\n* Cody states there is a difference in being successful and feeling successful.  Good leaders would ask an employee what makes him / her feel like they are being successful. \n\n* For Cody, success is feeling trusted and depended upon by others. \n\n* Cody knows how to better communicate the way he's feeling and his emotions now than when he was a SE. \n\n* Has a manager ever asked you, \"what would make you feel successful?\" \n\n* This provides a manager an opportunity to provide empathy to an employee. \n\n* Getting down into specifics is the only way to help both you and your manager understand what your needs are. \n\n## 33:55 - Anxiety and The Importance of Being an Ear \n\n* Cody flips the script on Nick and John and poses a question about people listening without giving advice.  Listen to hear the answers. \n\n* Know to ask for what you need when making a request of someone. \n\n* We have a tendency to automatically go into \"fix\" mode when hearing about others' struggles. \n\n* 39:47 Cody says some very low times in the last few years would not have happened if someone had taken the approach he suggested earlier. \n\n* Cody made a comment that crossed the line with someone, and the realization of that along with many other factors triggered an anxiety attack. \n\n* The next few days was a period of loneliness.  All he wanted was someone to talk to about the problem. \n\n* Everyone had their version of how Cody should deal with the issues, but that isn't what he needed.  All he wanted was someone to allow him to talk about it. \n\n* Many emotional moments from the past could have been so much better if someone had listened to hear instead of listening to respond. \n\n* Don't underestimate the value of being an ear to someone. \n\n* Cody goes deep here and shares his fears that being vulnerable affects his brand or how people think of him. \n\n* Cody likes to be transparent, but there is a level of transparency for all of us that must be kept inside the circle of trust (i.e. stuff from the lowest moments).   \n\n* Some of Cody's biggest career advice for others is do the things that make you happy, and figure out what those are (not the job…the things).   \n\n* For Cody, this is being a helpful technologist, someone good to put in front of customers, someone who is transparent with their feelings…not a guy who fell apart a bunch of times. \n\n* We have to expose our fears and talk through them to experience the healing. \n\n* We are trained to get over it and move on.  We're not ever trained to just let it happen and accept you will feel a certain way. \n\n* We don't want to let people see certain sides of ourselves. \n\n* Find the circle of people you can trust, and let your guard down for them. \n\n* Maybe you say to yourself \"I'm going to let this happen.\"  Have your day.  Have your anxiety moment.  Letting the stuff happen will make you better for it. \n\n* Building too much pressure up in a water line causes it to explode. \n\n* John mentions the practice of a clearness committee within a community where he used to live.  Listen to how the process worked. \n\n## 52:45 - Giving Advice \n\n* Cody describes his decision to leave the Cloud Management group at VMware.  A reset was required. \n\n* Cody has decided not to give advice to others unless they ask for it first. Another option is asking permission to give advice as a way to be considerate. \n\n* We all want to be needed by others and the self-confidence of giving others words to build them up. \n\n* It's hard to refrain from giving advice in the moment.  People often just need the opportunity to reflect what they're saying / what's happening so they can process it. \n\n* \"If you want to be the person who is there for people, listen to them.\" - Cody de Arkland \n\n* 55:07 - end the episode at \"This conversation got deep.\" \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. ","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-86":{"title":"Episode 86","content":"\n# Episode 86\n\nWelcome to episode 86 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss emotional tech support, verbose logging, and debugging with [Cody de Arkland](https://twitter.com/Codydearkland).   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 07-05-2020 \n\nTopics – Emotional Tech Support, Verbose Logging, and Debugging [[Cody de Arkland]] [[Episode 85]] [[MOC - Mental Health]]\n\n\n=============================================================== \n\n## 2:12 - Getting Support \n\n* Are the people who we consider an \"ear\" for us usually outside our immediate family? \n\n* Cody says we go to people for the support we need.  A spouse may not always understand about a work problem / struggle. \n\n* John says our families have baggage with us that color all conversations.  We don't want to burden our spouse with every single burden (i.e. treat like a stress ball), so to spread this around, we go to others who can empathize (a peer, co-worker, friend, etc.) \n\n* Going to mental health or spiritual councilors are viable options as well for support. \n\n* When you figure out the type of people you need for a specific conversation, you have found the circle of trust and reached a measure of emotional maturity.  Each member doesn't get all of the topics. \n\n* When we have not reached this level of maturity, we tend to shotgun things in all directions, causing collateral damage out of desperation.   \n\n* Whoever is in the shrapnel when you explode catches everything (unfiltered, unprocessed). \n\n* John and Cody relate our topic to GitHub pull requests. \n\n## 9:31 - Mental Plot Twists with Career Changes \n\n* Impostor syndrome doesn't hit Cody daily any longer. \n\n* He struggles with feeling included.  Cody wants to be seen in a certain light at HashiCorp. \n\n* He's less afraid of people figuring out he does not belong and more afraid of not being invited. \n\n* Even making a change within an organization (compared to changing companies) resets your reputation. \n\n* John speaks to asking for more money at a new company as an incentive to walk away from your network, political capital, etc. at a former employer. \n\n* John speaks to his experience in moving from VMware to Google (new customers, new co-workers, changing industries).  He felt initially like it may have been too many changes. \n\n* Cody wishes someone would have sat him down to talk through what his brain would do after making a move to HashiCorp.  This likely happens to all of us. \n\n* There is a hard reset of a person's reputation that happens in a change like this.  It may not hit on day one, but it will hit. \n\n* \"No one knows about that here, so don't take it personal.\" \n\n* Part of the reason for this podcast is to give people a fair warning about these types of changes so they don't feel alone when it happens. \n\n* 17:04 - Move to Hashi \n\n* Cody had a colleague who made the move and respects the company's position in the industry. \n\n* He points out the change was not for money but for his career and the specific space in which he would be working. \n\n* On an emotional level, moving from the Cloud Management team at VMware to the Kubernetes group was a big shock. \n\n* He didn't think too much about what changing groups might mean but had challenges moving on. \n\n* It was hard to figure out how to get involved in the new space and felt there was too much instability. \n\n* Even now, being removed from the decision for a few months, Cody agrees making the move to Hashi was still the right one. \n\n* Deciding a topic is best presented to a specific audience in a certain format (written vs. video for example) is thinking like a Technical Marketer. \n\n* Identify the message, what it is meant to do, who the audience will be, and the best medium to deliver it.   \n\n* It is attractive to a hiring manager in the Tech Marketing field for a candidate to explain reasoning behind the development of the content. \n\n* Look at your projects (at work / in the community) and how you would reflect them later.  Cody gives the example of creating a portfolio of his work. \n\n* Do this with your home lab, and by the way, put your home lab stuff on your resume!  Have specific reasons for what you have achieved. \n\n* Think about the things you are doing and how you want them reflected.  \n\n## 24:39 - Debugging Complex Problems \n\n* What do the actions you take speak to others about you?  Cody gives the example of what his brand is based on his actions. \n\n* We can treat emotional issues like technology problems (debugging, deconstructing).   \n\n* Sometimes we need others to reflect back what we're saying to be able to debug. \n\n* The good book of engineering says look at the problem's cause before solving it, but usually we think about how to fix something immediately without looking at root cause. \n\n* Take the problem, and decompose before we jump in trying to solve it.  Don't try to solve it without all the data. \n\n* John drops a reference to [The Soul of a New Machine](https://www.amazon.com/The-Soul-of-New-Machine-audiobook/dp/B01FCTJCR0) and then compares help desk work methodologies to the way we deal with emotional problems. \n\n* Cody had initial thoughts he wanted to share on the podcast, but we ended up stumbling on the thing that matters the most (value of listening). \n\n* Cody has heard of people who quit because they didn't deal with complex emotional problems. \n\n* Debugging yourself is extremely important. \n\n## 33:02 Logging Emotions \n\n* It isn't normal to dump your darkest fears onto social media.  Cody cares about the person who doesn't understand why they are angry and frustrated all the time but needs to see effective strategies for dealing with these things modeled. \n\n* The analogy here is log outputs.  Debugging is easier with verbose logging.  Looking at the logs of others with the same problems helps even more so. \n\n* Feeling alone is one of the worst things possible.  Cody doesn't want that feeling to haunt anyone. \n\n* John can't remember the name of the [Quantified Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self) movement and the possible approach of gathering metrics to help assess mental state. [[Quantified Self]]\n\n* Cody never feels anxiety posting on social media now but definitely did when he wrote the impostor syndrome blog post. \n\n* Read Cody's blogs on [impostor syndrome](https://www.thehumblelab.com/lets-talk-about-imposter-syndrome/) and [carrying baggage](https://www.thehumblelab.com/lets-talk-about-carrying-baggage/). [[Impostor Syndrome]] [[Carrying Baggage]]\n\n* The response from that post was so positive he decided not to feel anxiety about this any longer. \n\n* Cody has found a way to turn vulnerability into a strength. \n\n## 39:11 - Closing Thoughts / What's Next \n\n* Cody says career and lives are like seasons.  It isn't so much about what's next but rather \"when\" is next.   \n\n* It's a good time to be a nerd.   \n\n* Cody watches the market, what is happening with the products he works on, etc.  But he cares more about the way he is treated, what leadership believes, and what the organization believes…less about the individual technology. \n\n* Choosing something interesting to do as part of your work is still important. \n\n* Cody could go back to being a SE now if he wanted.  He knows who he is now. \n\n* It's about understanding the work you are going to be doing. \n\n* If next is now, what is the work you will be doing?  Will you feel like you are making a difference?  Think about it. \n\n* There is a balance of the business need and the emotional IQ need.  The businesses that really succeed figure out that balance by empowering leadership to make good choices. \n\n* Leadership means many things.  What is your turnaround rate, your transfer rate, etc.?   \n\n* You should have metrics on how employees are doing. \n\n* If an employee feels insecure in the role, some of this is on the leader for not coaching through it and trying to provide leadership through it. \n\n* Be a part of the wider community (whether technical, social, or some other community). \n\n* Cody speaks to how the technical community has built him up and how engagement has helped him along the way.  He continues to desire to pay that back as an active part. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-87":{"title":"Episode 87","content":"\n# Episode 87\n\nWelcome to episode 87 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss our thoughts on the book The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni. \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 08-01-2020 \n\nTopics – [5 Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756) Book Report [[MOC - Book Episode]] [[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team]] [[Patrick Lencioni]]\n\n## 00:55 - Introducing the Book Discussion Episode \n\n* If you have read the book, we would love to hear your feedback. \n\n* 1:33 - The book format is a business fable (presents a lesson in the form of a story). \n\n* 2:14 - John shares a quick summary of the book's plot that centers mostly on the CEO and executive team at a technology startup. \n\n* The book is available on Audible as well.  DM us if you want a free copy! \n\n* [What are the 5 Dysfunctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team#Summary)?  Nick walks through them. \n\n* Absence of Trust \n\n* Fear of Conflict \n\n* Lack of Commitment \n\n* Avoidance of Accountability \n\n* Inattention to Results \n\n## 5:14 - Trusting Business Fables \n\n* John is somewhat suspicious of the business fable approach, and Nick suggests practicing a willing suspension of disbelief with these types of fictional stories.   \n\n* The story is told from the point of view of the CEO with some insight into the other characters' thoughts and feelings. \n\n* John's suspicion of this style of book comes from having read [Who Moved My Cheese?](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Moved-My-Cheese-Amazing/dp/0399144463/) by [[Spencer Johnson]] and being pretty frustrated with it. [[Who Moved My Cheese?]]\n\n* We've discussed [The Goal](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951) as well as [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/1942788290) on the show previously.  Those books taught the characters through a Socratic method, while this specific book doesn't go about it in quite the same way. [[The Goal]] [[The Phoenix Project]]\n\n* John liked both books mentioned above but still found them magical to some extent. \n\n* Is the author trying to get the reader to accept the 5 dysfunctions as absolute truth or as a framework for use in certain situations?   \n\n## 13:00 - Applicability of the Lessons \n\n* If you are trying to become a front line manager, is this book's lesson applicable?   \n\n* Nick says yes, but it isn't quite apples to apples with the structure of the team presented in the book. \n\n* John comments that all members of a team likely do not work on a single project together like the executive team in the book worked on the success of the company. \n\n* Is our help desk analogy right?  Send us some feedback! \n\n* John shares an example of his teammates at Google, how they work on projects, and how collected teams work together.  Then he relates it back to being within an IT organization (i.e. working across team silos). \n\n* With the team construct in the book being people who work under the same manager, we found it difficult to generalize to other teams spread across multiple managers. \n\n## 20:35 - Highlights from the Book \n\n* The new CEO in the book took about 4 weeks to observe and understand the situation at the company. \n\n* Go back and listen to [Brad Pinkston's experience taking over management of a new team](https://nerd-journey.com/management-interviews-and-transitions-with-brad-pinkston/) and his strategy in the beginning. [[Episode 84]] [[Brad Pinkston]]\n\n* Nick references Brad's strategy for wait time before having career conversations with employees. \n\n* The CEO had a very controlled tone in the conversations, keeping her emotions in check early on in interactions with the team. \n\n* John mentioned there were a number of tense situations in the book.  Not everything went perfectly. \n\n* The CEO spoke to deciding between allowing a conflict to continue compared to solving it for the team members.  It was a similar decision point as to when to address bad behavior vs. allowing teammates to hold one another accountable. \n\n* The difficult conversations in the book were situations the CEO had experienced previously.  She learned from not getting those right in the past and developed the process she presented to her new team. \n\n* Encouraging vulnerability was encouraged by the CEO.  At the end of the book, we hear some specific exercises on encouraging vulnerability.   \n\n* Go back and listen to our recent episodes with [[Cody de Arkland]]. \n\n* EP 85 - [Impostor Syndrome, Anxiety, and Effective Listening with Cody de Arkland](https://nerd-journey.com/impostor-syndrome-anxiety-and-effective-listening-with-cody-de-arkland/)  [[Episode 85]]\n\n* EP 86 - [Emotional Tech Support and Debugging with Verbose Logging with Cody de Arkland](https://nerd-journey.com/emotional-tech-support-and-debugging-with-verbose-logging-with-cody-de-arkland/)  [[Episode 86]]\n\n* Many of the hard conversations happen at a team offsite.  Not all reactions from the executive team are positive, even the reaction to conflicting priorities about going to the offsite in the first place. \n\n* The CEO restated the team's problem at every offsite to remind them of the why behind what they were doing and to drive unity. \n\n* Consensus is bad.  This was more specific to difficult decisions and situations (i.e. high stakes). \n\n* If there is consensus, does that mean you need more people who think differently on the team? \n\n* Disagree, then commit.  Healthy conflict within the team when making difficult decisions is welcome.  Members of the team need to have their viewpoint heard. \n\n* The executive team had to learn this team was their first team and first priority.  All the reports should come in below this. \n\n* Should a manager's first priority be loyalty to their team of peers? \n\n* Nick labels the John White Paradox. \n\n## 35:48 - Summary Discussion \n\n* Is this a good book to read to learn management lessons? \n\n* Nick says yes.  The nuggets from the way the CEO acted, thought, and controlled emotions were very helpful. \n\n* John also says yes but struggled with the focus on an executive group in the story. \n\n* Are there other situations in which this book is worth reading? \n\n* Even if you are not a manager, anyone leading a team focused on a project can still use the tools described in this book. \n\n* Do you believe the lessons in the book? \n\n* Nick says yes, but get information from multiple sources to get a sense of what good looks like. \n\n* John labels this as an interesting framework for team success through building good practices, encouraging good behavior, etc. \n\n* Nick recommends reading [The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897) by [[Camille Fornier]] and [Systems of Engineering Management](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186) by [[Will Larson]].  Maybe we'll review one of these in a future episode. [[The Manager's Path]] [[Systems of Engineerign Management]]\n\n* Reach out to us with your thoughts on 5 Dysfunctions of a Team. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-88":{"title":"Episode 88","content":"\n# Episode 88\n\nWelcome to episode 88 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss leveling up your career and making the conscious decision to change with Yadin Porter de León.  \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 08-07-2020\n\n\nTopics – Leveling Up and Making the Decision to Change\n======================================================\n[[Yadin Porter de Leon]] \n\n\n## 2:05 - Career Background\n* Yadin is one of those people that recruiters have no idea what to do with.  He currently works for VMware as a part of the Marketing organization.\n* Throughout the conversation, Yadin will be channeling [Amy Lewis](https://twitter.com/CommsNinja). [[Amy Lewis]]\n* His background is in regional management, sales alignment, and professional services.\n* The bulk of his tech career was from working with companies like AIG, Apple, Dell, and VMware (customers of his at one time or another).\n* Yadin saw a disconnect in Marketing.  Maybe we should create content by people for people (very intuitive to the tech community).\n\t* Sometimes marketers will create content for an audience they don't really know (i.e. the person doing the creating may not know a CIO, a Database Admin, or a [SysAdmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator)).\n* When Yadin was young, he leaned toward tech around age 10 (got excited about AppleSoft Basic).  Listen to the story he shares about pseudo-hacking a program at school.\n* He was super into storytelling, and went back and forth between video production and tech.  He eventually attended film school.\n* Yadin got a MBA in Information Systems and made the decision to go all tech after the [dot com crash](https://www.newsweek.com/dotcom-bubble-crash-20-anniversary-technology-companies-ever-happen-again-1491385).\n* Yadin shares a story from his experience in the last week speaking with [Joe Beda](https://twitter.com/jbeda) and [James Watters](https://twitter.com/wattersjames) on his podcast.  It was intimidating to speak to people who are so technical. [[Joe Beda]] [[James Watters]]\n* Yadin was a documentary filmmaker at one point and lost his funding.\n\t* He received a from a friend about working at a software company around the same time and said yes.\n\t* Yadin feels like his journey started that day.\n\t* Right after leaving Thomson Reuters, the software company he originally worked for was dissolved.\n\n## 9:04 - Pro Tips on [[Leveling Up]]\n* Ask your company if they pay for any education.  There's usually something they will throw at you.  Check with HR first because there is cash to be had.\n* Yadin is the founder of the [Level Up Project](https://twitter.com/tech_levelup) and co-founder of [Tech Village Media](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tech-village-media). [[Level Up Project]] [[Tech Village Media]]\n\t* There will be a [vTrailMap](https://twitter.com/hashtag/vtrailmap) again this year for the benefit of the community.\n\t* The Level Up Project is in line with what we do on the podcast (helping people level up in their career by sharing lessons we learned earlier in our careers).  \n\t* John shares that he and Nick have had their eyes opened to the vast career possibilities for individual contributors.\n\t* The number one thing that opened Yadin's eyes from a career standpoint was podcasts.  It was not just one but many.\n\t\t* Yadin started with [The CloudCast](https://www.thecloudcast.net/) and went back to their first episode.  [[The CloudCast]]\n\t\t* He thought he was in tech but did not understand what it was like to be in tech until working for a tech company in Silicon Valley.\n\t\t* One of the reasons he started the vTrailMap was because he was lost on where to start in the industry (what podcast to listen to, what blog to read, etc.) and wanted to get involved.\n\t\t* Twitter and following people from various podcasts certainly helped, but no one had made a guide quite like the vTrailMap.\n\t\t* You have to be curious.  Take that up 10x.  Don't just listen to one podcast.  Listen to several.  It doesn't have to be with a specific regularity.\n\t\t* Listen to people who have done a job, and ask yourself if their role sounds fun.\n\t\t* Marketing has a lot of money, and they aren't afraid to give it to the right people.\n\t\t* Following your passion is a recipe for disillusionment.  \n\t\t* Yadin believes we should show up, do the work, and find the passion.  Show the discipline drip by drip, day by day.  If the passion isn't there, maybe it's time to move to another role.\n\t\t* When I showed up one day, what gave me the most value / got me the most excited?\n\t\t\t* Was it working on a new technology or something else?\n\t\t* Whether you are a [pioneer, settler, or town planner](http://geek-whisperers.com/2016/02/the-pioneer-settler-town-planner-continuum-with-brian-gracely/)…find out where you want to fit.  There's no shame in loving ITIL, for example, if it is something you love to do.  But find an organization that will let you do the work in a way you want. [[Pioneer, Settler, Town Planner]]\n\t\t* Share a blog, a podcast, comment on Twitter.\n\n## 17:05 - What if I'm Too Busy / Burned Out?\n* Burnout is real.  IT personnel are asked to do more with less consistently.\n\t* When you're in that situation and can't get off the treadmill, that is a health issue (i.e. not enough time to complete the basic components of your role).  \n\t* Sometimes we create more things to do than can be done.  But if others are putting things on you that you 1) don't want to do and 2) requires more time in your day than you have, that is a huge red flag.  Just to get oxygen, you have to move to a different organization.\n\t\t* No one wants to go to their manager and say they are overwhelmed.\n\t* Even if your day is packed, you can reach out to people (send an email, send a DM) to see what working in a specific role is like.\n\t* The best time to do what you are thinking about doing is NOW.\n\t* In any situation there are 3 things you can do, but you have to choose one and pursue with intent.  \n\t\t* Accept it - if this is your choice, you must stop complaining.\n\t\t* Change it - do something about it, and stop complaining because you're doing something about it.\n\t\t* Leave - get out of the situation.\n\t* By declaratively choosing, you take control (situation is doing something for me vs. doing something to me).\n\n* Reach out to [Yadin](https://twitter.com/porterdeleon) on Twitter, see #vTrailMap, and subscribe to the [Tech Village Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/techvillage).\n* Yadin is most proud of his work on [The CIO Exchange Podcast](https://cio-exchange-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes).

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss changing your career trajectory with Yadin Porter de León.\n\nOriginal Recording Date: 08-07-2020\n\n# Topics – Changing Your Career Trajectory\n[[Yadin Porter de Leon]] [[Episode 88]]\n\n## 2:36 - Changing your Career Trajectory\n\n-   Yadin's job is fairly unique. Because of his vast experience, he was betting on the fact that there will be a role that matches this.\n    -   He values doing things that make sense through Marketing channels which actually helps people.\n-   There are not a lot of tips and tricks that really help move the needle with career progression.\n    -   There are many good things out there, but they involve getting in a rigor.\n-   To change the trajectory of your career, you must take a step back.\n    -   Am I happy with the direction that I am going?\n    -   Do I want to do something different?\n    -   Some people want to just do one thing (like a Database Admin) and be really good at it. But they may want to keep doing it and have time for their family.\n        -   If that is what you want, decide it is what you want…and then do it.\n        -   Don't feel like you need to be the CEO of a company someday.\n        -   Is an early heart attack something you want? There's someone else who can do the job you are doing and be intrinsically happy doing the work.\n        -   If you don't like managing people, don't manage people. So many people hate their jobs because their manager took a management role without wanting to do it or having the skills to do it.\n            -   Many pursue management because it seems like the next logical step.\n    -   Yadin takes a philosophical approach. He's never had the same job title twice. But that approach is not right for everyone.\n        -   He advocates making a declarative choice on the life balance you want (no such thing as work / life balance).\n        -   Everything feeds your soul and takes energy from you. Decide what you want that balance to be.\n        -   Every time Yadin approached a new job, he asked himself if it was going to be a new path to help him grow or just something he would enjoy doing right now.\n        -   If you're afraid of trying something new every time, don't do it.\n        -   You don't have to be transformative every day. But feed the lifestyle you want.\n        -   Don't chase pay and title. Don't take prescriptive advice from someone who says you must get a MBA or a bunch of certifications. Decide on the lifestyle you want FIRST.\n        -   Make peace with your decision (i.e. I won't be rich, etc.).\n        -   Hard core career coaches like [Kat Troyer](https://twitter.com/dailykat) will tell you that you must do the hard work. Understanding what you want to do for your next career comes down to understanding what you want, how you want to live your life, and what will be best for your family. [[Kat Troyer]]\n        -   Nick believes many people don't think they have a choice.\n            -   We don't often take the time to reflect on what now is like.\n            -   People feel like they are beggars more than choosers.\n            -   Recruiters are your friends, and you don't have to pay them anything. DM [Yadin](https://twitter.com/porterdeleon) for some recommendations on recruiters.\n\n## 13:33 - [[Scale Your Networking]]\n\n-   You need [[Proof of Work|proof of work]] to scale your networking.\n    -   This can short circuit a number of conversations.\n    -   \"If only 3 people in the world know how good you are, then those 3 people control your destiny.\" You need more than those 3 people to know how good you are.\n        -   Those 3 people are busy people with their own time constraints.\n        -   That’s where blogging comes into play as do podcasts and networking.\n        -   Choose a channel, but you must figure out a way for more people to know how good you are.\n        -   You must take your talent and put it out into the world so everyone knows.\n            -   Examples - code on GitHub, blog posts, podcasts\n            -   The number of followers on social media or number of hits do not matter. All that matters is that the right person reads the blog, sees the code, or hears the podcast.\n            -   Listen to Yadin's story about the blog post he wrote for the VP who hired him as immediate proof of work.\n            -   You have to get past the fear of exposing your talent.\n            -   Otherwise, you will struggle to get out of that box or silo.\n            -   Even if you don't get a job after interviewing, more people know how good you are.\n            -   Get yourself out there, or you have to stop complaining.\n            -   Yadin references their parting bit from the [Tech Village Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/techvillage). Stop making excuses and complaining unless you are going to own it. Start putting yourself out there. It does mean being vulnerable. It does mean people critiquing your work. [[Tech Village Podcast]]\n    -   19:02 - John says putting yourself out there and vulnerability seemingly conflict.\n        -   We all have a comfortable level of risk.\n        -   The same is true for putting yourself out there. If no level of risk is acceptable, you might not get any further. But make your choice.\n        -   John mentions that growth and progression require discomfort.\n            -   You're going to be in a situation where you don't know the answer to a question.\n            -   Be ok with saying you don't know, and agree to go and get the answer for someone.\n            -   Yadin shares a great story about having only 5 minutes to convince someone he and his teammates could find the answer to a really important question.\n            -   Find those moments where you can put yourself in an uncomfortable situation. If you never put yourself there, you won't move forward.\n            -   Be declarative, and be ok with it (even if that is not growing at all).\n            -   Yadin shares with us what's really important to him when it comes to career considerations.\n\n## 24:14 - Should We All Market Ourselves?\n\n-   Yadin shares an emergency situation in his role compared to other roles and the difference in stakes (i.e. higher for brain surgeons, etc.).\n-   He chooses very intentionally not to be a brain surgeon or support an app that affects thousands of people when it goes down.\n-   People hear the word comms often. Communications is just telling people what you're doing. Whether within your organization, in an internal wiki, or in blog that communication has a virtuous cycle effect (helps them and helps you).\n-   The next time a problem happens, that person will think of you. It may give you a chance to help them again, to mentor them, etc. Imagine another team seeing you as a subject matter expert. * It helps others but also gives you confidence and experience in communication.\n-   Yadin gets up wondering who he can help that day while putting food on his family's table. Marrying those two is a win.\n-   Maybe your passion is doing what you do now. Maybe you need an organization that recognizes a technical career path. To progress you might need to find an organization that does.\n-   You can progress as an individual contributor if the organization lets you.\n    -   Don't take a management role because it is the only option…unless some other reason requires it for a time. But be declarative knowing you will only do it for a period of time.\n    -   \"I have never been more satisfied and have never done better work than I am right now. And not one person reports to me.\" - Yadin Porter de Leon\n    -   Yadin shares the story of managing many people as well as vendors and contractors. You can be an individual contributor and make more money, do different things, etc.\n    -   Managing people is a profound responsibility. The people reporting to you need someone who shows up and delivers for them, someone who helps them find the confidence they didn't know they had.\n-   Reach out to [Yadin](https://twitter.com/porterdeleon) on Twitter, see #vTrailMap, and subscribe to the [Tech Village Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/techvillage).\n-   Yadin is most proud of his work on [The CIO Exchange Podcast](https://cio-exchange-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes).

We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss our review of [The Inner Game of Stress](https://www.amazon.com/Inner-Game-Stress-Challenges-Potential/dp/140006791X).   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 08-21-2020 \n\nTopics – [The Inner Game of Stress](https://www.amazon.com/Inner-Game-Stress-Challenges-Potential/dp/140006791X) by [[Tim Gallwey]], [[Edd Hanzelik]], and [[John Horton]] [[The Inner Game of Stress]] [[MOC - Book Episode]]\n\n==================================== \n\n## 0:58 - Setting the Stage \n\n* DM us on Twitter if you want a free copy of the book on Audible! \n\n* John liked the Kindle version in addition to just the audio version so he could see pictures, etc.  Nick did audio only and took notes from time to time. \n\n* This started from a podcast John listened to called  \n\nAgainst the Rules with [[Michael Lewis]]. Season 1 is about referees, and season 2 is about coaching. There was an episode about [the coach in your head](https://atrpodcast.com/episodes/the-coach-in-your-head-s1!82597) he found intriguing.   \n\n* [Michael Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis) is an author of some popular books that were made into movies like [Moneyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball) and [The Blind Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Side:_Evolution_of_a_Game). [[Moneyball]] [[The Blind Side]]\n\n* On the show they mentioned another book called [The Inner Game of Tennis](https://www.amazon.com/Inner-Game-Tennis-Classic-Performance/dp/0679778314) by [[Timothy Gallwey]].  [Tim Gallwey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gallwey) was a well known coach at the time of its writing. [[The Inner Game of Tennis]]\n\n* We found there were other books by Tim Gallwey and stumbled upon the one we're discussing in this episode.  With so many out there experiencing times of stress and burn out in our current world, we felt it would be appropriate to review the book on air. \n\n* For Inner Game of Stress, Tim paired with two medical doctors (Edd Hanzelik and John Horton).  These doctors sought Tim out and used a mixture of medicine and inner game techniques to help treat patients feeling the physical effects of stress. \n\n## 7:29 - Overview of the Book \n\n* Part 1 - The Game of Stress \n\n* Why Stress \n\n* This section discusses the physiological basis of stress, why it is necessary, the fight / flight / freeze reactions we can have, and what prolonged stress can do to the body. \n\n* Two Selves \n\n* Self 1 is the critical storyteller. \n\n* Self 2 operates in the moment and leverages our natural abilities. \n\n* Meet Your Stress Maker - Self 1 \n\n* Learn how self 1 works, the stories it can tell you, etc. \n\n* Gearing up and Gearing Down \n\n* There were stories provided about the long-term effects of stress (gearing up) and the idea of gearing down (rest, recreation, reflection). \n\n* 11:10 - Part 2 - Outsmarting Stress \n\n* The Inner Game Learning Code \n\n* Awareness \n\n* This is a non-judgemental awareness of what reality is.  The stories we tell ourselves are not always how things are.  Awareness helps self 2 drive instead of self 1. \n\n* Choice \n\n* Conscious choice is important.  Consider the why and reasoning behind choices and the intent rather than making them automatically. \n\n* Trust \n\n* Where will you place your trust?  Will you trust that you have the tools to overcome your problems already without getting in your own way? \n\n* Tree of Stability \n\n* What brings you back away from the stress and allows self 2 to work? \n\n* Build a Personal Shield \n\n* This is a construct that describes the qualities / things that protect you from stress and push you toward stability. \n\n* Be the CEO of Your Life \n\n* Do we really act like we own all decisions we make?  We are in control even though we do not feel that way at times. \n\n* The analogies / constructs are very useful, but you are free to use your own analogies. \n\n* 15:37 - Part 3 - The Inner Game Toolbox \n\n* These are tools you can actively leverage to help deal with stress. \n\n* Tool # 1 - STOP \n\n* In the moment when you feel stressed, stop for a second (does not have to be a long period of time).  Think about what it is that is stressful and what you want from the situation.  Think about how you should actually proceed. \n\n* John shares an example anecdote from the book. \n\n* Tool # 2 - Being the CEO \n\n* Tactically, if you define the mission of your life like a company, what would it be?  What are your policies and values?  What are your resources (inner and outer), and how are you going to use them?  How many shares will you sell to others?   \n\n* Disclaimer - we did not say it before now, but the book is not a dry list of suggestions.   It contains stories about anonymized real patients who had problems with stress and used these tools with coaching from one of the authors. \n\n* Sometimes you need to buy the shares back that have been sold. \n\n* Tool # 3- The Three Control Questions \n\n* In self-reflection, consider these questions. \n\n* What don't I control? \n\n* What am I currently trying to control? \n\n* What could I control that I'm not presently controlling? \n\n* Understand the things you are making active decisions about, unconscious decisions about, and what you could be making active decisions about. \n\n* This really goes back to awareness. \n\n* Tool # 4 - Trying on a New Attitude \n\n* This one sounded similar to John's mention of a clearness committee in [Episode 85](https://nerd-journey.com/impostor-syndrome-anxiety-and-effective-listening-with-cody-de-arkland/).  [[Episode 85]]\n\n* Tell a group of people about your stress, and try to determine the attitude you have.  Others suggest an attitude for you to try on, and you are required to try each one nonjudgementally.  Choose the one that seems right / feels the best based on the situation. \n\n* Facing the situation with a different attitude can really help, and it's helpful to have others suggest those attitudes. \n\n* In the moment, you can be blind to many things. \n\n* Tool # 5 - The Magic Pen \n\n* This is the idea of [free writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing) the point where self 1 has run out of things to say and you get to what self 2 (or the non-judgemental observer) has to say. [[Free Writing]]\n\n* This reminded John of [Free Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing) popularized as [morning pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing) in [The Artist's Way](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-Spiritual-Higher-Creativity/dp/1585421472).  [[Morning Pages]] [[The Artist's Way]]\n\n* Every morning, the creative should spend time writing without stopping.  Fill three pages of content in a stream of consciousness exercise.  \n\n* The magic pen is more about a focus on getting into the mindfulness state rather than mentally clearing your throat by writing. \n\n* Tool # 6 - Transpose \n\n* Try to imagine yourself in the other person's shoes and answer the following questions. \n\n* What are you thinking? \n\n* What are you feeling? \n\n* What do you want? \n\n* This is a great exercise to help you show empathy.  It can also give some insight into another person's perspective. \n\n* If you assume the person does not have malicious intent, what could be going through their mind? \n\n* Tool # 7 - Redefine \n\n* Think about words used to define what is happening to you.  Perhaps it can be defined in a different way to decrease stress. \n\n* A process, policy, or rule in your life could be based on conditions that no longer exist. \n\n* John shares a fun anecdote from the book. \n\n* To Nick, this is similar to \"that's how we've always done it\" and speaks to the value of fresh eyes. \n\n* Tool # 8 - PLE Triangle \n\n* PLE represents performance, learning, and enjoyment. \n\n* All three are needed when making goals for yourself.  Will that performance goal that allows learning and is enjoyable? \n\n* If so, it is a recipe for success. \n\n## 28:44 - Summary Discussion \n\n* Is this a book that is worth reading to be better at handling stress? \n\n* Nick says yes.  He likes the stories as well as the tools.  His favorite tool is the control questions. \n\n* John thinks the book is useful.  The analogies are powerful, but if they don't happen to be something you click with, you could create your own analogies based on the same concept. \n\n* His favorite tool was the STOP tool.  Being aware that you are stressed in the moment is challenging.  Having the power to engineer a way to pause takes effort.   \n\n* You will not be good at using the tools initially without practice. \n\n* John didn't feel like the book was selling a series of seminars (just the ideas in the book). \n\n* Likely John and Nick will read some of the other books in the inner game series. \n\n* Are there situations other than career in which this book is worth reading? \n\n* John says yes.  Keep in mind stress can come from work, personal life, extended family, friend group, or some other area.  The source of stress is not important.   \n\n* Career burnout and stress are finally being talked about in our industry, but remember the lessons here are not just career related.  [[Burnout]]\n\n* Nick thinks the stories in the book allow you to see the ways stress effects people physically in different ways.  He didn't think about how degenerative that constant exposure to stress can be. \n\n* Do we believe the lessons in the book? \n\n* Nothing in the book is encouraging you to shy away from the stress.  They encourage you to enter the stress on your own terms. \n\n* The author addresses the idea of people believing if you are not stressed, something is wrong.  John associates this with \"macho\" and \"toxic masculinity.\" \n\n* Nick mentioned the story about alpha males in animal observations being more susceptible to disease and the pack doing better without them. \n\n* Don't be that guy! \n\n* Stress is needed if there is danger to keep you safe and keep you alert, but you don't want it all the time. \n\n* Pay attention to your physical reactions. \n\n* Part of the philosophy of the inner game is being aware of what is happening without classifying things as good or bad. \n\n* The tactics in part 3 of the book seem to assume using awareness to your advantage. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-91":{"title":"Episode 91","content":"\n# Episode 91\n\nWelcome to episode 91 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss some Reddit threads from the IT Career Questions forum.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 09-11-2020 \n\nTopics – Popular IT Career Questions from Reddit [[Reddit Questions]]\n\n## 1:05 - We're Testing A New Format! \n\n* We're trying a new format this week.  It's a round up of career advice threads from the Reddit forum [IT Career Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/). \n\n* We'll be taking some of the top posts from the past week and will give a brief synopsis of the threads, categorize the post, and share our reactions. \n\n## 1:47 - [Keep not getting entry level jobs due to \"lack of experience\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ip6tly/keep_not_getting_entry_level_jobs_due_to_lack_of/) \n\n* Synopsis \n\n* The poster claims little to no experience and that he / she keeps getting turned down in interviews due to lack of experience.  They have an A+ certification, 6 months of IT experience, and want to change the experience. \n\n* Categories \n\n* [[Resume writing]] \n\n* [[Interviewing]]\n\n* Reactions \n\n* Nick points out that commenters on this thread draw out the fact that the poster had an internship in addition to their 6 months experience.  This speaks to the fact that we need to be mindful of what can be used as experience when writing a resume and interviewing. \n\n* For example, a home lab is experience you can use!  Listen to [this episode](https://nerd-journey.com/emotional-tech-support-and-debugging-with-verbose-logging-with-cody-de-arkland/) with [[Cody de Arkland]]'s tips for leveraging experience with home labs on your resume / in an interview. [[Episode 86]]\n\n* John says we need to ensure we talk about everything that is relevant.  Go into the interview with some goals (solid idea of what you have accomplished, how you measured it, make sure you are able to work in main talking points, etc.). \n\n* The resume is an attention getter.  It is a springboard for further dialogue in an interview to give more detail. \n\n## 5:35 - [Landed a job with no degree and experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/inioqx/landed_a_job_with_no_degree_and_experience/) \n\n* Synopsis \n\n* The poster landed an IT job without experience (only troubleshooting knowledge from home) and also without an IT related degree. They currently work as a junior engineer fixing computers and laptops.  This poster was previously rejected for other jobs due to not meeting the requirements. \n\n* John drops a reference to the [Geek Squad](https://www.bestbuy.com/services/remotesupport).  Nick shares a fun anecdote. [[Geek Squad]]\n\n* Categories \n\n* Encouragement \n\n* Advice \n\n* Reactions \n\n* This post shows what someone did to achieve success and is sort of the opposite of the first post we mentioned.   \n\n* John harasses Nick for buying a new desktop PC. \n\n* We're truly happy for the poster.  It's nice to see someone achieving their goal after struggling. \n\n* If all jobs require experience, how do you get hired with no experience? \n\n* Building PCs as a hobby is practical experience that can be leveraged in these sort of situations. \n\n* There are ways to get experience even if not in a professional experience. \n\n* Many times hiring managers for entry level positions are looking for people who are enthusiastic and can acquire that knowledge.  Nick mentions seeing [Spiceworks Community](https://community.spiceworks.com/) posts from managers confirming the desire to find enthusiastic candidates. \n\n* Nick references [Switch](https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Change-Things-When-Hard/dp/0385528752) by [[Chip and Dan Heath]] and the idea of finding the bright spots. [[Switch]]\n\n* Think about where you can go if you're deep into PC hardware guts.  The next level career probably won't involve this, and the [[Compensation]] has a ceiling.  Progress into operating systems, networking, end user computing administrator. \n\n## 13:56 - [IT job that pays well, but does not offer a lot of good experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/incrwa/it_job_that_pays_well_but_does_not_offer_a_lot_of/) \n\n* Synopsis \n\n* The poster doesn't feel like the work he / she does is valuable to get to the next level in the tech field (patching network cables and supporting customer computer / phone problems).  They mention the pay is good but that they would rather be an expert in their field (seems stuck in \"basic help desk\", no chance to work on new technologies). \n\n* Categories \n\n* Stay here vs. go elsewhere based on [[Career Goals|career aspirations]] \n\n* Career Advancement \n\n* Reactions \n\n* Nick sees working closely with end users as an opportunity to build soft skills that can help you market yourself. \n\n* Perhaps this is an opportunity to automate the fix for repeating problems. \n\n* John emphasizes interaction skills as a gateway to higher paying jobs. \n\n* Maybe this situation is an opportunity to talk about long term [[Career Goals|career aspirations]] with your manager to get their support, influence the type of work you get to do, etc. \n\n* Nick shares a story on this. \n\n## 18:08 - [How to transition from Tech support to DevOps or other technical roles?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/iodg8b/how_to_transition_from_tech_support_to_devops_or/) \n\n* Synopsis \n\n* The poster has worked in IT support for 3 years and wants to transition to  Cloud  / DevOps engineer.  The person has no coding skills but some basic knowledge of software release processes.  They are seeking advice on how to get started and how to handle job interviews about previous experience (have been very honest on resume but get no calls back). \n\n* Categories \n\n* Career Advancement \n\n* Skills Gap - request for resources \n\n* Resume writing \n\n* Interviewing \n\n* Reactions \n\n* One of the best comments on this thread suggested a mindset shift in the metrics on which to focus when applying for a DevOps role (shift from tickets closed to SLOs and availability). \n\n* Can you demonstrate you have made the mindset shift? \n\n* It's also important to understand what you're asking for in this new role (i.e. understanding DevOps). \n\n* Experience in the IT support side alone may not get you there. \n\n* Check out one of the links provided in the highest rated comment on this post for a great roadmap - [[https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops)](https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops)). \n\n* Read the job description for anything entitled DevOps carefully. \n\n* Approach with the mindset of the job you want instead of the job you have.  John suggests reading up on the [SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) role](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/) and adopting these same mindsets. #SRE \n\n* This is a chance to get mentored by someone already doing the job you think you want. \n\n* Try talking to your manager as well to get projects of interest. \n\n* Go back and listen to [Episode 45](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-045-career-conversations-with-your-manager/) on career conversations with your manager and [Episode 13](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-013-the-sniper-approach-to-job-hunting-with-tom-delicati/) on [[Tom Delicati]]'s job hunting approach that created a new role at the company who hired him. [[Episode 45]] [[Episode 13]]\n\n## 25:09 - [Just found out that I am the lowest paid employee at my mSP and I am very upset](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/iqevjm/just_found_out_that_i_am_the_lowest_paid_employee/) \n\n* Synopsis \n\n* The poster was hired at below asking salary at a small MSP and was the sole helpdesk person for a while, putting tons of effort into the job. After the company hiring a junior engineer to help with workload, the poster then found out the junior makes more money, which made him furious. The poster left and scheduled a meeting with the owners the next day to communicate the situation.  It worked to land a raise! \n\n* Categories \n\n* [[Asking for a raise]] \n\n* Anger \n\n* [[Equitable pay]] \n\n* Problem - resolution \n\n* Reactions \n\n* Figure out whether you are being compensated properly, and don’t wait for a situation like this to ask for more money! \n\n* Putting in sweat equity when not getting compensated in some way doesn't make sense long term. \n\n* Discuss what you have been doing vs. requirements with management.  Consistently going above and beyond requires some compensation (money). \n\n* Maybe we should be asking about annual performance / compensation reviews during the interview process. [[Performance Review]]\n\n* John references a really interesting comment from the thread that shifts the issue from \"I'm not being paid as much as a junior person\" to \"I'm not being compensated properly for the amount of work and quality of output.\" \n\n* It's uncomfortable to talk about compensation and something we do not practice. \n\n* Nick shares a story about a new boss asking about compensation after Nick changed teams within the company. \n\n* We seemed to skew toward early career here, but it was an interesting experiment.  Let us know what you think! \n\n* This is proof that many others are wondering the same things you are.  Ask. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-93":{"title":"Episode 93","content":"\n# Episode 93\n\nWelcome to episode 93 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss Leadership and Supporting Employee Potential with Paul Green, Chief Development Officer of Angel MedFlight.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 09-16-2020 \n\nTopics – Leadership and Supporting Employee Potential \n\n=========================== \n\n## 02:12 - Meet Paul Green \n\n* [Paul Green](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulgreen130/) is the Chief Development officer at [Angel MedFlight Worldwide Air Ambulance](https://www.angelmedflight.com/) and was the CIO (Chief Information Officer) when he started with the company. [[Paul Green]] #AngelMedFlight \n\n* Paul held the title of CIO at his previous company as well. \n\n* He started in IT in 1998 as a kid thrust into a Network Administrator position at a public company.  No one else there knew much about computers. \n\n* The CFO was confident Paul knew more than other employees at the company. \n\n* Paul shares a story about working as a night auditor while in college and setting up the new property management system for a fellow employee who struggled to get it right. \n\n* Listen to the challenges of running Dell Optiplex hardware on Windows 98 from back in the day.  Paul compares the difference in computer setup then vs. now. \n\n* Coming through the ranks back then required real learning.  Multiple iterations were required to get better. \n\n* IT now is about software more than hardware (was previously more about hardware). \n\n* There were few best practices back then and a lot of people just figuring things out on their own.   \n\n* This past experience allows Paul to think about things different than others. \n\n* Instead of thinking outside the box, Paul didn't realize there was a box in the first place. \n\n* Paul did not start in IT to do things a certain way.  He was doing his own thing and followed his father and grandfather's examples of doing things right the first time. \n\n* Something as simple as zip tying wires inside a server case mattered.  Attention to the small details communicates to others that you are about the work you are doing. \n\n* \"The details are what really count in IT.\" - Paul Green \n\n* The difference in having a nice application and having a really good application is the details.  Take Instagram vs. Facebook for example. \n\n* John mentions the idea of polish as an accumulation of many details.  Think inside the box before you start thinking outside. \n\n* Is this attention to detail Paul mentioned something managers appreciate today? \n\n* It depends on the manager's experience.  Paul had a CFO who cared nothing about details (only completion) and contrasts with his current CFO who cares about every detail. \n\n* It was more about how \"clean\" something was done, which lends itself well to paying attention to details. \n\n## 11:44 - [[Management vs. Leadership]] \n\n* Paul has seen the entire spectrum of management. \n\n* If Paul is not willing to do something himself, he should never have to ask an employee to do it. \n\n* He likes to work alongside his employees to accomplish goals while simultaneously helping support their growth. \n\n* \"It's not my job to tell you how to do your job.  It's my job to help you figure out how to do it on your own.\" - Paul Green \n\n* Paul likes to ask questions and use analogies to help employees think through a situation.  It's important to pay attention to how employees learn and understand things.  [[Coaching vs. Directing]]\n\n* Paul enjoys having lunch with employees to understand their personality, how they interact, and how they work.   \n\n* \"I don't have supervisors, and I don't have managers.  I only have leaders.\" \n\n* Every single person with a staff is a leader whose job is to make the people below them better, which subsequently makes the leader better and the organization better. \n\n* Paul references [Start with Why](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591846447) by [[Simon Sinek]] as a great read. [[Start With Why]] \n\n* He started a book club inside the company, and they are currently reading Start with Why.  The next book will be [Talking to Strangers](https://www.amazon.com/Talking-to-Strangers-audiobook/dp/B07NJCG1XS/).  Understand why you are doing something, and learn how to talk to the people for which you are doing it. [[Talking to Strangers]]\n\n* IT leaders need to put together the right IT to accomplish the company's mission.  Understand operations within the company to associate the proper IT with the organization. \n\n* Stop worrying about what a new tech product is.  Find the one that fits the situation and goal the best.  Tag lines, terms, and fancy acronyms don't mean much.  What gives my company's goal the best chance to succeed? \n\n* Nick references [Three Signs of a Miserable Job](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Signs-Miserable-Job/dp/B000VA1PCG) by [[Patrick Lencioni]] and mentions many employees have trouble making the connection between what they do and the purpose of the company. [[Three Signs of a Miserable Job]]\n\n* Paul says giving someone a purpose helps them excel. \n\n* When speaking of his current company, Paul says they don't change the world.  But, the people the company has helped might just change the world one day because of a second chance. \n\n* Paul lets his employees know they don't just do IT.  Employees are the fundamental underlying reason why Angel MedFlight can do what it does…change people's lives.  Being better at the job helps people facing the patients be better at their job. \n\n* We have to ensure people understand the role they play in these outcomes. \n\n* This is a challenge in large organizations.  We discuss VMware, Apple, Chick-Fil-A, In-N-Out Burger as examples of companies with very overwhelmingly positive morale and how this creates customer loyalty. \n\n* John references [Idiocracy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/) and an example of a very unenthusiastic employee in a Costco in the movie. [[Idiocracy]]\n\n* Enthusiasm for your organization is infectious.  Paul wants to feel that when people from other organizations talk with him. \n\n* How do leaders get people on board in a way that isn't just saying the words? \n\n* Don't tell someone how to do something.  Show them what a company means to you so others can be onboard. \n\n* Paul tries to be relatable to others as much as possible and shares an interesting story about a discussion with the CFO about his influence on employees. \n\n* Consistently showing employees that you aren't going to lead them down the wrong path builds rapport and trust. \n\n* Showing employees that anything is possible encourages them to think in a similar manner. \n\n* For those just starting out in IT, say yes to what you're asked to do unless there's no way you can do it.  Take time to learn how, and use proper resources.   \n\n* Be willing to do what it takes, and ask for more work. \n\n* When you have spare time, asking a leader for something else to work on shows your dedication.  This helps the leader put you in a position to get more work that is a greater challenge.  Paul shares a great example of how he has done this for an existing employee and how it changed that person's trajectory and increased self-esteem. \n\n* John points out this is a stretch goal and that leaders can help make employees successful in getting to those goals. \n\n* Paul says if something is a huge stretch, help prepare the employee for it in chunks.  Give projects which allow the employee can succeed, and build on that. \n\n* 33:16 - Detecting and Supporting [[Employee Potential]] \n\n* Sometimes people surprise you.  Paul has hired many people over the years. \n\n* During the hiring process, Paul seeks to ask questions a certain way to determine if the employee is committed to their work and will give full effort. \n\n* Some of the questions are outlandish.  He asks real world questions to test the thought process. \n\n* Paul is looking for thought process, attitude, mindset, and whether the person is a fit with the team more so than the educational background. \n\n* A team is better than one person.  Paul mentions [Moneyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)) and its ties to the formation of a team. [[Moneyball]] [[Michael Lewis]]\n\n* The highest draft pick may not make the team better.  It's about how you will integrate the new team member. \n\n* Looking outside IT is fine.  For help desk, find someone who can communicate, describe the thought process behind what they are doing, etc.   \n\n* Look at the role, and find the right fit for the role (i.e. skills fit vs. traditional background). \n\n* Paul shares a great story about his lead developer (a Marine who was the lead mechanic on a helicopter and held a job deployed on a boat for a number of years).  The environment in which this person worked was very different than those many in IT work in today. \n\n* Putting together people from different background and different walks of life is almost like putting together a team of superheroes.  Paul's team is a unique group that really gels well together and has delivered some amazing outcomes.  \"The box doesn't exist for my team.\" \n\n* Nick mentions [Range](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) by [[David Epstein]] and how Paul's team seem to fit into the premise that generalists triumph in a specialized world.  [[Range]]\n\n* Paul shares a great example of how a generalist would be best fit for a Security Specialist role and relates this to how the CIA makes their hires. \n\n* Current leaders need to be setting up employees for long-term success. \n\n* Someone once asked Paul why he wanted to train people to make them better for the company.  This person was afraid this would make the employees so much better that they leave. \n\n* Some people will leave and move on no matter what. \n\n* Set people up for success.  They may leave eventually, but you will get the best out of the employee while they are at your company.  Otherwise, you may be settling for mediocre employees. \n\n* A mediocre employee who improves is a positive impact on other employees and will infect the entire team. \n\n* Helping people on the path to success will help you as a leader. \n\n* One of Paul's favorite things is watching people grow.  Seeing the excitement when someone proves they can do what they never thought they could is extremely empowering. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. ","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-94":{"title":"Episode 94","content":"\n# Episode 94\n\nWelcome to episode 94 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]! We're [John White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vJourneyman/) ([@vJourneyman](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)) and [Nick Korte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/) ([@NetworkNerd_](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/)), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we'd been given earlier in our careers. In today's episode we discuss career progression, the role of CIO, and growing towards it with Paul Green, Chief Development Officer of Angel MedFlight.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 09-16-2020 \n\nTopics – Career Progression, the CIO Role, and Growing Towards It [[Paul Green]] #AngelMedFlight [[Episode 93]]\n\n================================================================= \n\n## 02:22 - Tips for the Individual Contributor's Career Path \n\n* Ask a lot of questions.  Paul is notorious for this.  His first boss even asked him to stop asking questions. \n\n* New employees should ask if they don't understand.  Ask to understand the reasons behind the tasks and how they fit with the company's goals. \n\n* Paul used to go to stakeholders and ask why they needed something.  Giving people what they ask for is not always the answer.  Give them the perfect product for the process they are trying to accomplish. \n\n* People generally don't know what they want.  We can usually give them something better. \n\n* Paul talks about how his team looks at processes, outcomes, and solutioning at his company.  Asking more questions allows for the delivery of better products.   \n\n* Don't start off with a goal of wanting to be a supervisor or manager or CIO.  Start by working hard, asking questions, and getting out of your comfort zone. \n\n* Paul shares an interesting story of a mentee who wanted to be a Network specialist but ended up elsewhere. \n\n* Don't focus on the outcome.  Moving to different roles allow you to figure out what you want to do. \n\n* Staying at the same company for many years is pretty rare in today's world and may not come with big pay raises.  Normally loyalty and longevity of this nature comes from a love for the work. \n\n## 09:40 - The [[CIO's Role]] \n\n* Paul never had aspirations to be CIO.  He thought about doing bigger and better things every year. \n\n* Paul wanted to do cool things in his industry to push what he was doing forward and shares career experiences in hospitality. \n\n* During this process, he wanted to build the best IT solutions for the business. \n\n* Paul doesn't do things for compliments.  He does it for the enjoyment and to show that anything is possible. \n\n* You don't really know what a CIO does until getting there, but if you're coming up with ideas to make the business better, you are getting closer to it every day. \n\n* A CIO today is 50% operations and 50% IT.  Now IT is in the forefront of a CEO's mindset.  Quality IT drives business forward. \n\n* Everything Paul has done in his career was to drive the business forward. \n\n* Always be thinking about how to build a better process. \n\n* Think of fellow employees as customers, and give them the best tools to do their job while treating them well. \n\n* Keep pushing forward to build better processes.  Paul shares an example of process improvement through technology from healthcare. \n\n* A CIO should be just as worried about the operations as the company as the budget in IT and what products IT is delivering.   \n\n* Never buy a product because it has a cool tag line.  It is not about new, fancy, shiny. \n\n* Buy for what fits the goal and direction of the company. \n\n* Organically move up through an organization without the goal of being CIO someday.  On the way you may find something you are way better at than you realized. \n\n* There is no right path for someone.  It is not how you start but how you finish. \n\n## 21:06 - Ideas for Personal Growth \n\n* Paul shares the example of a college student with communication skills moving into IT.   \n\n* Paul does not like to silo people.  You may not ever know their full capabilities. \n\n* This is a challenge within large organizations.  The way you communicate with others, and your enthusiasm will be noticed. \n\n* The worst thing one can do is stay in the same job for many years.  If you don't show an enthusiasm to do something else, you won't ever change. \n\n* Show your superior you are capable of the job to which you're applying.  Start selling yourself on day 1.  Communicate in the right way so that when the next step comes, your superiors have taken notice and will give you the chance to move on. \n\n* Paul loves it when team members encourage one another.  Leaders notice this kind of thing. \n\n* It is much easier to sell yourself over time than to start when you get into the interview. \n\n* A good leader is going to notice employees doing the right things. \n\n* People don't work for organizations.  They work for leaders.  Working for a good leader will deliver a good outcome. \n\n* If a really good leader does not take notice, have a conversation in humility to confirm you're on the right path. \n\n* Put yourself in the position to humbly make the boss notice. \n\n* Find a leader whose \"why\" you can support and that aligns with your \"why,\" especially if you have aspirations to progress. \n\n* These types of leaders will take you on a path of growth, even if some day it is not with them.   \n\n## 30:02 - Progressing to CIO \n\n* Understand what is out there from a product perspective.  Read and research, whether things relate to your business or not.  You won't know if something is best for you unless you know what is out there. \n\n* Paul reads a number of different books on a wide spectrum of topics. \n\n* He just finished [The Sixth Man](https://www.amazon.com/Sixth-Man-Memoir-Andre-Iguodala/dp/0525533982) by [[Andre Iguodala]]. [[The Sixth Man]] \n\n* He just started [Shoe Dog](https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-Nike/dp/1501135929) by [[Phil Knight]].  [[Shoe Dog]]\n\n* You are never finished learning.  Paul shares the example of helping a recent college graduate think differently about what's next. \n\n* Paul likes to learn how to do something rather than be told about it.  Learning how to do something and making mistakes allows deeper learning than just telling. \n\n* He prefers guiding employees and allowing this same learning process. [[Coaching vs. Directing]]\n\n* Learn about business, and understand what is out there.  If you are in IT, you are in business.  IT drives business processes, and these processes change companies. \n\n* There's no amount of information that is enough.  If you want to be a really good leader, all of the information you take in will apply in some way. \n\n* A lot of it will help you out with some of your team members.  Talking to people on their level, and being conversant in a variety of topics helps build camaraderie. \n\n* Ask questions.  Be present.  Too many of us are not present in the conversation.  If you can't be in the conversation, figure out how to get into the conversation. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-95":{"title":"Episode 95","content":"\n# Episode 95\n\nWelcome to episode 95 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss losing a teammate.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 09-27-2020 \n\nTopics – [[Losing a Teammate]] / Team Transitions \n\n============================================== \n\n## 0:57 - Scenarios for Losing a Teammate \n\n* Positive attrition \n\n* Think of this as an internal transfer.  This happens frequently in organizations that encourage progression. \n\n* Negative attrition \n\n* This is someone leaving the company (an outside offer, unexpected termination). \n\n* Neutral case / re-organization \n\n* For example, Nick moved to a new team last year because of some shuffling of resources within the company.  This seems to be more frequent in large organizations or as companies change their focus. \n\n## 4:11 - Effects on the Team \n\n* Will the person be backfilled? \n\n* This is going to affect morale.  What can you do to take increased ownership of higher morale? \n\n* This is a necessary step as part of your growth within an organization.  \n\n* This may be challenging of the team suffered from a sudden loss of a teammate. \n\n* Many team members are going to wonder if someone leaving will be looked at as a cost cutting opportunity for the company. \n\n* Nick recommends checking out [this episode of Datanauts](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/datanauts-101-the-business-side-of-it/) with guest [[Tim Crawford]] about the [[Transformational CIO]]. \n\n* Workload \n\n* Who will carry the workload and cover what the former teammate was doing, or how would it be distributed to everyone on the team? \n\n* Replacing someone does not happen instantly, and covering someone's workload does not imply you are immediately an expert in what they were doing.  Factor in the ramp time. \n\n* What about vacations when the team is short staffed? \n\n* This is worse on smaller teams. \n\n* Perhaps this is a chance to take on additional / more advanced work and gain experience. \n\n* This could be a chance for you to step into a more senior role while the gap in the team shifts to needing a more junior role instead. \n\n* There is a special case for smaller teams in regard to workload.  What if there were only 2 or 3 people and you lose someone? \n\n* This speaks to the need for good communication, documentation, and cross training on the team. \n\n## 12:08 - Effects on the Manager \n\n* Disclaimer - Nick and John have not had experience in a people management / leadership role (i.e. responsible for hiring / firing, compensation, career path for employees). \n\n* Go back and listen to [Episode 93](https://nerd-journey.com/leadership-and-supporting-employee-potential-with-paul-green/) to hear [[Paul Green]]'s description of what a leader is. [[Episode 93]]\n\n* Have empathy for the manager and what may be going on in their life.  The manager has to focus on hiring / filling the gap or perhaps having to justify the need for the role. \n\n* Team morale will need attention, but they may have less 1-1 time for employee relationships. \n\n* Does the manager have a bench of good candidates to pull from, or do they need to start working with a recruiter or possibly recruiting on their own? \n\n* The manager must also be con \n\n* This is a time to review job descriptions carefully if you're the manager.  Maybe the team needs something different now for strategic reasons.  This will take more time, however. \n\n* The workload of the manager will undoubtedly increase temporarily.   \n\n* Some of this may be filling in operational gaps from the loss of a team member or helping the rest of the team understand how their responsibilities have changed for the time being. \n\n* It can be a rough job in times of transition. \n\n* How can you jump in to help in the interview process?  Ask your manager! \n\n* Another career focused idea is to help review the onboarding processes for your manager.  There may be nothing written down or a process that has not been updated in a while. \n\n* If the head count cannot be replaced, the manager has to try to prevent greater morale dip / attrition. \n\n## 20:15 - How You Can Help \n\n* Provide good candidates for the opening on the team. \n\n* Be candid about what you know of candidates you are recommending and their work.  If you have not worked with them directly, be up front about it.  Have you read the person's blog and found it helpful, for example? \n\n* Having a valuable network of candidates can be part of your value to the organization.  Make sure you think it's actually a fit. \n\n* Check to see if your company has a referral bonus! \n\n* How can you support your teammates? \n\n* Provide 1-1 support. \n\n* Be positive in team settings. \n\n* Have empathy for others, and ensure they feel heard. \n\n* Help the team out with coverage if you are able. \n\n* Increasing the scope and scale of your responsibilities for the team is something you can put in a promotion packet. \n\n* Document this somewhere. \n\n* Go back and listen to our episodes with Cody de Arkland to help with showing empathy to others. \n\n* [Episode 85 - Impostor Syndrome, Anxiety, and Effective Listening](https://nerd-journey.com/impostor-syndrome-anxiety-and-effective-listening-with-cody-de-arkland/) \n\n* [Episode 86 - Emotional Tech Support and Debugging with Verbose Logging](https://nerd-journey.com/emotional-tech-support-and-debugging-with-verbose-logging-with-cody-de-arkland/) \n\n* Welcoming a new teammate \n\n* Take a new member under your wing, share knowledge, and make the person feel welcome. \n\n* We can all take ownership of team culture. \n\n* Learn about a new team member's strengths.  They have fresh eyes to analyze the organization's processes. \n\n* When someone asks about the why behind something and you cannot answer, maybe your documentation needs improvement or processes need to change. \n\n## 31:26 - Keeping in Touch with Former Teammates \n\n* Maintain your network, and keep the line of communication open. \n\n* Schedule time to catch up now and then. \n\n* You never know when the two of you may be working together again. \n\n* Don't make every interaction you asking for help.  Ask what you can do to help. \n\n* Curating your network is another series of tasks you can schedule. \n\n* All of the things we have discussed are above and beyond our day-to-day tasks.  It's not something you will find in your job description.   \n\n* Look at what you are doing.  How can you change it to further your career?  \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-96":{"title":"Episode 96","content":"\n# Episode 96\n\nWelcome to episode 96 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss sponsorship, dreams, and the path to entrepreneurship with Ashley Connell of Prowess.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 09-30-2020 \n\nTopics – Sponsorship, Dreams, and the Path to Entrepreneurship [[Ashley Connell]] #Prowess [[Women in Technology]]\n\n============================================================== \n\n## 02:20 - Meet Our Guest, Ashley Connell \n\n* [Ashley Connell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-connell-bb847a11/) is the CEO and Founder of [Prowess](https://prowessproject.com/), an organization that helps companies find expert talent by vetting and certifying talented women who took time off from the work force in some way and want to get back into it. \n\n* The candidates could be caretakers, a leader who wants to take a step back, or someone who is after a career pivot. \n\n* Prowess has built a job matching platform that matches not only skills and expertise to roles but also communication style, behavior style, personality style with the team the person would be joining.  This produces a better candidate fit to the role. \n\n## 3:28 - Finding #Spiceworks and A Fairy Godmother \n\n* She graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a degree in public relations but had no intention of pursuing a career in it. \n\n* Ashley started looking for internships in Marketing and stumbled across a small company in Austin called [Spiceworks](https://www.spiceworks.com/). \n\n* She knew nothing about technology at the time but saw they had an opening in entry-level Marketing. \n\n* Listen to Ashley's story about the interview with her would-be manager and how it didn't go exactly as she thought it might. \n\n* In any case, Ashley became Jen Slaski's first Marketing hire. \n\n* She became a guinea pig for different Marketing projects. Once she tested them and got them off the ground they could be handed off to someone else. \n\n* Ashley worked in the Austin office for about 4 years and then moved to London for a couple of years and helped open an office overseas, which helped her see Marketing from a global perspective. \n\n* John and Nick originally met through the [Spiceworks community](https://community.spiceworks.com/).  In much the same way, Nick met Ashley when she worked for Spiceworks at some local meetups in Austin. \n\n* Nick digs into Ashley's interview with Jen Slaski a little deeper.  She was slightly overdressed for the interview and the culture at Spiceworks. \n\n* Ashley was comfortable with asking questions and not knowing things.  When talking to IT Professionals in the community, she made her role clear (helping to amplify the Spiceworks brand and connecting Marketers to IT Professionals).  It wasn't to know everything about technology. \n\n* At the end of the day, Ashley's knowledge of technology didn't matter.  People were more focused on building community than on their differences. \n\n* 9:09 - What about the gender imbalance in the Spiceworks community and greater technology industry? \n\n* The hard part about being a female is you do not know someone's intention.  You want to assume the best, but when people want to take you to coffee for career advice, for example, it may or may not be what they are bringing to the table. \n\n* Spiceworks was a safe spot, but there were comments here and there that were inappropriate.  Sometimes she had to pretend she didn't hear them, which is horrible. \n\n* If she could go back and change something, she would have said something. \n\n* John makes the point that it is difficult early in your career to stand up to yourself in front of peers. \n\n* Ashley talked to some women younger than her about these situations later.  She had originally thought staying in those situations / being considered one of the guys was a good thing or a way to progress her career.  \"You should not have to be a part of the boys club to get to the next level.\" \n\n* John says this is like a tacit allowance of harassment.  It should be a constant 0 on the scale rather than getting to even a 1. \n\n* Spiceworks was good at spotting this and calling it out, but at places later in Ashley's career, the organizations weren't so good about it. \n\n* Even for males, why be considered one of the boys if that means allowing harassment? \n\n* Many women in the tech industry leave their roles because of sexual harassment. \n\n* For our male listeners, if you see something, say something.   \n\n* Ashley was involved in building [Spiceworld](https://www.spiceworks.com/spiceworld/), the annual Spiceworks conference which began in 2008.   \n\n* Listen to her story of when the conference was hosted at the Alamo Draft House in Austin. \n\n* Putting on a conference like this makes you think through a number of backup plans for failure scenarios.  When people pay for a 3-day experience, there is a lot of pressure to make things work. \n\n* The Spiceworks community was great at giving feedback, whether good, bad, or ugly.  It came from a genuine desire to improve things. \n\n* There seemed to be a secret sauce behind Spiceworks and their community.   \n\n* There was empathy among IT Professionals, with Tech Marketers, and with Spiceworks employees. \n\n## 19:19 - That's What Dreams Are Made of \n\n* When Ashley got to move to London, it was her dream.   \n\n* She studied abroad in college and really enjoyed it. \n\n* During her interview with [[Jen Slaski]], Ashley mentioned wanting to go back to Europe as a career goal.  As it turns out, Jen orchestrated a way for Ashley to reach that goal by helping to open the European Spiceworks office. \n\n* Ashley refers to Jen as her \"real life fairy godmother.\" \n\n* Finding mentors, champions, and sponsors early in your career is incredibly key to get to the next level. \n\n* Sometimes we stumble upon these folks, and other times we have to seek them out diligently. \n\n* In every stage of your career you need coaching.  John gives the example of Tiger Woods at the top of his game still needing a coach. \n\n* Great quote - \"Managers talk to you.  Mentors talk with you. Sponsors talk about you.\" [[Managers, Mentors, and Sponsors]]\n\n* This is part of that internal marketing we all need to do so people know who we are and what we are doing to make the organization more valuable. \n\n* Great managers find a way to help their employees meet [[Career Goals]] and can help retain talent while promoting growth. \n\n## 24:16 - Life at The Big Corporation \n\n* Ashley left Spiceworks and worked for a small startup after coming back to Austin. \n\n* She quickly realized she was doing all the same things she had done while at Spiceworks. \n\n* A superstar is always wanting the next opportunity.  A rock star wants to be steady and be an expert in one thing.   \n\n* Each of these personas has different types of motivations.  Ashley is a superstar. \n\n* She was recruited by SanDisk next, which was her first big corporate company. It was critical to her understanding of how big companies work. \n\n* 25:16 - The role required a great deal of travel (50% of the time she was away in the Bay Area). \n\n* She was able to get to know people higher up in the company, and they were able to get to know her. \n\n* As in the past, the line was crossed a bit in some of these activities, which caused discomfort.  There were a bunch of 1s that happened at this company. \n\n* Ashley was eventually laid off.  In fact, she was offered to either interview for her current position at 30% less pay or take a severance package. \n\n* She chose to take the package (an easy decision). \n\n* This caused no emotional downturn.  Being an entrepreneur at heart, Ashley was ready for her next pursuit. \n\n* Working for big companies with a very structured promotion plan does not work well for Ashley.  It may not suit her ambition or progression goals.  She realized this just was not for her. \n\n* This is a lesson in finding out what a growth trajectory within the company is like.  John mentions knowing to ask about this in interviews. \n\n* When you bring in a spouse / partner, it is not just your decision in these types of situations.  Sometimes there must be trade offs on who takes the career risk. \n\n## 31:54 - The #Entrepreneur Bug \n\n* At this point, Ashley had the entrepreneur bug and started a Marketing consulting firm with some folks from SanDisk (A10 Partners). \n\n* She made so many mistakes during this experience. \n\n* It does not feel like failing when you're in it. \n\n* The entrepreneur bug started piece by piece with her experience at Spiceworks and then SanDisk. \n\n* The biggest mistake at this consulting firm was having a \"whale\" client. \n\n* Ashley worked with 2 other partners with much more experience than her. \n\n* As a result, she hid her voice within A10 for a long time because of her perceived low rank.  Ashley went along with ideas she wasn't sure about as a result.  She did not feel safe enough to expose weakness. \n\n* She realized much later that not taking a more active role in activities like brainstorming was a missed opportunity.   \n\n* The culture was not one in which they could afford to have anything less than great ideas.  The A10 client base was large tech companies, and these companies relied on the A10 team to be polished experts who always had the right answer. \n\n* John makes a great point about this having to do with career inexperience, which can affect all of us. \n\n* John references the TV show [House, M.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(TV_series)) and relates it to Ashley's predicament at A10.  [[House, M.D.]]\n\n* This dove tails nicely into diversity.  You need a number of different views to get the best product in the end. [[Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion]]\n\n* Make sure your teams come from different backgrounds and have different experiences. \n\n* Ashley shares her thoughts on culture fit vs. culture add.  The latter makes the team better. \n\n* John makes a reference to a county fair competition in which laymen guessed weight more accurately than experts.  [The Wisdom of Crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds) \n\n* This is about diverse points of view  \n\n* Nick points this back to [Range](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) by David Epstein and continues to buy into the idea of late specialization and varying experience. \n\n* Go back and listen to [Paul Green's description of a team](https://nerd-journey.com/leadership-and-supporting-employee-potential-with-paul-green/) very much like this.  Start around 33:16. \n\n* 46:55 - Culture in small teams \n\n* A10 dissolved because they lost their \"whale client.\"  It was mostly due to some well-intentioned white lies made by team members. After-release edit:47:27 - 47:51 \n\n* It can be very hard to forgive after this kind of thing happens and is difficult to think about what's next.  They decided to stop operation shortly thereafter but remained friends. \n\n* Entering into a business partnership means having a plan for when the partnership dissolved.  Don't think about your marriage like this. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey. ","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-97":{"title":"Episode 97","content":"\n# Episode 97\n\nWelcome to episode 97 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [[@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)]!

In today's episode we discuss the journey that Ashley Connell, the founder of Prowess Project, took to get from idea to fully operational.   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 09-30-2020 \n\nTopics – Building Your Own Business From Idea to Operations [[Ashley Connell]] #Prowess [[Women in Technology]]\n\n============================================================ \n\n## 2:20 - The Start of Something New \n\n* The morning just before A10 lost their biggest client, Ashley had a great idea for a new business. \n\n* She had recently read [Built to Sell](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Sell-Creating-Business-Without-ebook/dp/B004IYISQW) by [[John Warrillow]] in a single sitting. [[Built to Sell]] \n\n* The book is a business fable about an entrepreneur who wanted to sell a company that wasn't worth anything and his journey to change things.   \n\n* Ashley read the book, wrote a list of things she thought she was good at, and the next morning picked one.  This was the birth of [Prowess](https://prowessproject.com/). \n\n* It started with an idea about meetings.  Often times meeting wrap ups with action items and notes are not handled properly. \n\n* What if they could do a sort of Uber for meetings and have people pay for a meeting facilitator? \n\n* Ashley had lunch with a friend from middle school who was running an accelerator program. \n\n* Ashley applied the next day and was accepted to [Founder Institute](https://www.linkedin.com/school/the-founder-institute/), which takes you from idea to Incorporated in 4 months. [[Founder Institute]]\n\n* The program is very challenging and is the best thing she has ever done. \n\n* An accelerator program is typically for scaling an existing business.  Founder Institute was more of an incubator (idea to reality). \n\n* Regarding the list Ashley made, it was about 9 things she felt were her strengths. \n\n* This was right after the A10 breakup. \n\n* The number one thing on the list was note taking.  She is very good at making sure things get accomplished at work. \n\n* As Ashley later learned, meeting facilitation in small snippets is more of a discomfort and not a pain.  People pay to get rid of pain and not discomfort. \n\n* In addition, her heart was with women returning to work.  She was, at the time, in her early 30s and married but did not yet have children. \n\n* Throughout her career, she had an ongoing anxiety about how having children would affect her career progression. \n\n* According to Harvard Business Review, if a woman is out of the workforce to raise children for 3 years, she loses 30% of her potential compensation that can never be made up. \n\n* Ashley became obsessed with this statistic.  How could women not have both? \n\n* The meeting facilitation idea would allow training women to do this wherever they were located. \n\n* However, the two real things people needed were additional project management and more empathy. \n\n* Prowess helps the women who took time off from the workforce.  They get training that leads to a certification.   \n\n* Half the curriculum includes confidence, goal setting, emotional intelligence, and communication. \n\n* The other half is on working remotely, business trends, technology training, and project management. \n\n* At the end, a candidate takes a test to be counted in or out of the Prowess job pool. \n\n* During the process, the Prowess team gathers 52 different work style indicators on the candidates and their work. \n\n* Getting to this point was all about responded to feedback. \n\n* Ashley's experience was as a hiring manager, someone who would use a member of the Prowess community to help their business. \n\n* This was key in not getting overly passionate about the mission and not concentrate too much on talent development. \n\n* Initially Ashley went and spoke to hundreds of women returning to the workforce. \n\n* About 43% of women leave the workforce to raise children at some point. \n\n* There was not a clear path for these women to return (no step-by-step process), making them feel overwhelmed and intimidated. \n\n* The mix of mentorship, training, and community seems to be the secret sauce.  All of the lessons Ashley learned from Spiceworks are being applied to her current company. \n\n## 17:13 - Being CEO of Prowess and Finding Her Why \n\n* They have been around for less than 2 years and have about 7 employees and 40 customers.  The pool of talent is about 250 women. \n\n* It was important to balance the talent with the opportunities for Prowess.  They make money through placements and matching companies with talent.  They can be more selective. \n\n* There is an application process for candidates.  Certain requirements apply to join the community.  The certifications mentioned are a requirement as well. \n\n* During COVID, Prowess created a pay it forward program so that once a candidate gets a job, they pay for another person to go through the program. \n\n* This is fostering an ambassador program as well. \n\n* 21:20 - Thinking Like CEO \n\n* The way to get there is talking to your team.  Truly understand their desires, dreams, what their family is like, and their personal goals. \n\n* Ashley runs the business not for herself but for her employees. \n\n* She surrounds herself with smart people and enables them to use their talents to move the company forward. \n\n* Is she still in the Built to Sell Mindset? \n\n* No.  She has a 10-year plan for the company. \n\n* Ashley built an organization to solve her future problem (being a woman who wanted to have children someday). \n\n* Interviews, sourcing, and feedback take an amazing amount of time.  Prowess can help cut down this time commitment for organizations because of their rigorous process. \n\n* Ashley gives an example of how a prospective employer could get help from Prowess and get candidate recommendations for a specific role quickly. \n\n* How do you progress the people? \n\n* Ashley wants to build out more resources to bring emotional intelligence into the workforce.  This is where many people shine, but this is dulled down or absent in a typical hiring process until you talk to them. \n\n* Hiring is moving to the next step, and Ashley wants Prowess to be at the forefront. \n\n* To own your own business, you must be obsessed with whatever it is you are doing. \n\n* That was one of Ashley's problems with A10 (was not obsessed with Marketing).  With Prowess, Ashley has found her why. \n\n* Entrepreneurship is extremely hard, perhaps even more than being in Sales. \n\n* Obsession with solving the problem is the only way to keep going. \n\n* The process is tiring yet rewarding. \n\n* Finding balance \n\n*  Ashley has her employees write down what they want and what they don't want.  It is often easier to write down what you don't want to paint the picture backward. \n\n* After painting the picture, it's important someone hold you accountable. \n\n* Taking time off is certainly important here. \n\n* The conversation may be over for now, but we certainly want to have Ashley back at some point! \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-98":{"title":"Episode 98","content":"\n# Episode 98\n\nWelcome to episode 98 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

In today's episode we check in on John's lessons learned after one year as a Customer Engineer at [[Google Cloud]].   \n\nOriginal Recording Date: 10-24-2020 \n\nTopics – [[Google Cloud]] 1 Year Check-in [[Google Cloud]] [[John White]] [[Year Check In|X Year Check-In]] [[Sales Engineering|Customer Engineer]]\n\n=========================== \n\n## 1:48 - John's Role at [[Google Cloud]] \n\n* John is Customer Engineer at [[Google Cloud]] (the public cloud provider part of Google), which is a Pre-Sales Technical Engineering role. \n\n* This type of role can be called different things at different companies - Pre-Sales Engineer, Sales Engineer, etc. Sometimes this is called a Solution Architect (depends on how the company defines it). \n\n* John acts as the technical front line of the [[Google Cloud]] portfolio for a couple of salespeople.  He helps with customer conversations about the technology and with territory management.   \n\n* This is similar to the role he had at VMware but has its differences. \n\n* John supports two salespeople (account reps they are sometimes called) as a stateful technical resource. \n\n* As for his customer base, he has about 15 ranging in size from startups born in the cloud to extremely large healthcare customers.  All of these are in what Google classifies as the Enterprise space (again, may be defined differently than at other vendors). \n\n## 4:34 - Potential Career Paths and Differences from #VMware \n\n* As John progressed at VMware he focused on excellence in Solution Engineering, but he did not take steps to setup for a career in [[Technical Marketing]], [[Managing People is a Different Skill Set Than Being an Individual Contributor|People Management]], [[Product Management]], etc.  When the opportunity came along to pursue a different role, it made sense to stay on the same path. \n\n* The customer mix, the organization, and the products are different even though the role itself is quite similar (i.e. difference in the execution of similar tasks). \n\n* Differences from VMware \n\n* The Customer Engineers under John's manager operate in a pooled model.  Each person has strengths and weaknesses, and teammates can provide additional support to their peers with some additional freedom to take primary responsibilities when it makes sense. \n\n* The set of specialists overlays (product specialists) available to engage for help is roughly the same but are specific to [[Google Cloud]] products.   \n\n* John gives examples of overlay teams for specific products such as AI, a Security Center of Excellence, G Suite, and others (recent acquisitions like [Apigee](https://cloud.google.com/apigee)). \n\n* John has assimilated to [G Suite](https://workspace.google.com) after initially being hesitant about a move away from Office 365.  He does, however, miss Visio. \n\n* In roles like this, an Engineer is assigned from a compensation standpoint to the [[Sales Quota|quota]] of a territory which is the same as one or more account representatives. \n\n* The Engineer is there to act as a technical resource without regard to Sales attainment (compensated differently from a Sales rep).  John shares some minor differences in percentages of variable compensation. \n\n* Quotas at [[Google Cloud]] are very different.  John's quota is aligned with his manager's quota (as are all members of the team), which means there is no disincentive to helping someone else on the team (no variable compensation misalignment among team members).  \n\n* This model promotes collaboration, and it made John feel freer to ask for help. \n\n* John mentioned in some models, a manager's compensation could be aligned with an Engineer helping a teammate, but that is not the case for the specific Engineer. \n\n* The VMware portfolio was always growing and seemed to have expanded to over what someone could expect to know at a 200 level across the board. \n\n* At [[Google Cloud]] it may be larger than that already.  To be able to demo every product in the portfolio is probably expecting too much.  John gives the examples of Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Data Lakes, and Data Warehousing as areas that were pretty new to him. \n\n* There are 8 different database engines to understand (type of storage, use case, etc.). \n\n* It's tough to compare.  The depth of knowledge required to gain proficiency / excellence in each area is a steeper climb at [[Google Cloud]]. \n\n* When he first started at [[Google Cloud]], John had moved from a 100% field role at VMware to working in an office each day. \n\n* Previously, he had the luxury of visiting the VMware office here and there (maybe once per week), but at Google his commute became 40-50 minutes daily. \n\n* The benefits were getting face to face with colleagues, which encouraged camaraderie and collaboration.  With the need to work completely from home for now, John misses these benefits (especially eating meals together and just talking with others). \n\n## 24:19 - Industry Experience without Organizational Knowledge \n\n* The [[Ramp Time]] to really understanding the [[Google Cloud]] organization and its processes took longer than John thought. \n\n*  Structures and roles \n\n* It was difficult to learn which teams do what and when to call them in.  It takes time to understand.   \n\n* The Solution Architect role, for example, is more code driven and usually has some kind of product overlay focus (working on product integration, much like a Product Manager at VMware). \n\n* Google has an Enterprise Cloud Architect role with a very subtle difference from a Customer Engineer. \n\n* The need to be humble was extremely important as John had to repeatedly ask for guidance from others. \n\n* He's documented the rules of engagement to provide for others joining the [[Google Cloud]] organization to help them ramp quicker. \n\n* With enough iterative work here, maybe this document could be something presented to people during orientation. \n\n* New types of positions within the company are constantly being created (a Solution Manager, for example), adding to the list of things to know. \n\n* A different customer base \n\n* There seem to be many more cloud native customers in the Google customer mix.  It's quite different from what John saw at VMware.  Some of these companies were born in the cloud (i.e. never bought physical servers, etc.).   \n\n* Many customers are greenfield (not current [[Google Cloud]] customers).  At VMware, John worked with existing customers throughout his tenure and managing their growth. \n\n* Some customers may have existing relationships with Amazon or Microsoft as it relates to cloud technologies, but Google Ads may be the only relationship the customer has today with Google. \n\n* John has to help his customers understand Google's capabilities and that they are more than just a search company or a company that develops Android. \n\n* This working with greenfield customers is a muscle that someone in Pre-Sales should practice exercising (i.e. talking to customers about a new line of business your company has is along the same lines). \n\n* The segment of healthcare \n\n* At VMware this was a specific vertical segment for healthcare.  John is sort of working in the vertical but not in the actual vertical.  John's manager does not focus only on managing Engineers in the healthcare and life science space, for example. \n\n* The learnings from the healthcare and life science vertical can still be applied as a help in this customer set. \n\n* Learning the healthcare industry, buying patterns, motivations, etc. was very new for John.  With 80% of his customers being in this industry, he is required to bring an opinionated stance on how to use Google's technology in the space.  This is a tremendous growth opportunity. \n\n* A new product portfolio \n\n* John was nervous about this at first.  It has taken a year to get his head around it. \n\n* It was extremely important to remain humble.  In the first 12 weeks, an architecture certification was required, but John was given focused time to train for it. \n\n* Each product has a certain depth of complexity. \n\n* See [Episode 23](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-023-johns-3-year-check-in-at-vmware-part-1/) from John's 3-year check-in at VMware. He mentioned it took a year to get competent in the job, and then he had to work to get proficient. \n\n* It took the same amount of time at Google with the same methodology. \n\n* John had to be ok with being humble and unafraid of asking questions in front of peers. \n\n* He offers new hires the opportunity to ask him questions as they ramp in a safe space. \n\n* Can someone get a job at a technology company without knowing the portfolio? \n\n* John thinks the best bet is either 1) deep domain knowledge of the technology (implement, sell, or maintain the products) or 2) deep domain knowledge of the role (technical sales, product management, etc.). \n\n* In the Pre-Sales field, there is a talent shortage.  Many companies will look to recruit from colleges and train graduates to become technical sales professionals.  This helps build the talent pool. \n\n* John's father was in technical sales at Eastman Kodak many years ago.  Even then, John did not know the role existed or exactly what it was. \n\n* If there is another way we left out, please let us know!  We want to hear the story. \n\n## 49:47 - Some Parting Career Tips \n\n* For those trying to break into Pre-Sales… \n\n* Identify what you want to do early on.  Be open to nontraditional roles.  Listen to podcasts on pre-Sales technical engineering. \n\n* We had [Ramzi Marjaba](https://wethesalesengineers.com/) on as a guest in [Episode 27](https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-027-ramzi-marjaba-interview). [[Ramzi Marjaba]] [[Episode 27]]\n\n* Get educated on the different jobs out there.  Look on company websites for different technical roles (analyst role, systems administrator, database admin, project management, etc.). \n\n* Spoiler alert…there is a part 2 coming! \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the journey.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.042589041Z","tags":null},"/Episode-99":{"title":"Episode 99","content":"\n# Episode 99\n\nWelcome to episode 99 of the Nerd Journey Podcast [@NerdJourney](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney/)!

contributor roles.   \n\n* John thinks the promotion from L4 to L5 is the last one a manager can have sole discretion on, but there is heavier scrutiny for the higher level promotions.  This is mostly speculative as John has not been through a promotion cycle just yet. \n\n* Technical background and complexity of work you are capable of doing consistently continue to raise as one moves up through the levels. \n\n* There are no specific descriptions for L3 through L7 except Customer Engineer.   \n\n* John mentioned a new role called Enterprise Cloud Architect (a role closely aligned with the Customer Engineer role), and most of those folks are L6 / L7.  The job description is different from Customer Engineer, and the engagement model is also different.  They just happen to report to the same managers as Customer Engineers. \n\n* Keep in mind there are options at large companies to progress as an individual contributor which may not be there at smaller companies.  It doesn't have to be Pre-Sales either. \n\n* What is John's take on being tied more to cloud services than before? \n\n* At #VMware before John left there were a number of subscription services.  Over time, that seems to be happening more and more.   \n\n* One of his favorite products was Wavefront (now named Tanzu Observability by Wavefront).  It is a high volume time-series database that can really only be done in the cloud. \n\n* When you buy something as a service (whether in your own datacenter or elsewhere), the service is owned and operated by a different party but provided to you for consumption. \n\n* There is this bleeding edge perception of cloud services, but John's thinking on it has evolved.  Cloud services are not inherently bleeding edge / cutting edge.  Listen to the examples he gives of services that are useful but aren't super exciting (O365 / hosted e-mail). \n\n* Some of the services Google has are a bit earlier in the hype cycle but may require more knowledge to handle. \n\n* VMware is in this business as well (i.e. services around Kubernetes). \n\n* Another example would be machine learning.  The more these services become commodity, they become more like infrastructure and a bit less glamorous.   \n\n* Cloud companies of all types are focusing on products a little earlier in the maturity cycle. \n\n* 13:07 - Many people go work for a vendor because they are passionate about the technology.  Has John achieved a passion for the technology as a result of his experience after not having used much of the technology coming into Google Cloud? \n\n* Before working for VMware, John was excited about bringing the technology he wished he could have used as a customer to his customers. \n\n* Coming into Google Cloud, things like key differentiators of the services offered were not as clear to him.  These were things he asked about in the interview process. \n\n* Once on the inside, John came to better understand. \n\n* Things like artificial intelligence and machine learning were somewhat \"hand wavy\" and felt like buzz words.  Now John understands what machine learning is, what infrastructure needs to be in place for it to work, why we would want to use machine learning, etc. \n\n* It was similar for data analytics, data pipelines, etc.  These are all valuable when you have the right problem to solve, but one must understand the problem well. \n\n* John mentioned streaming data analytics and how Wavefront from VMware helps solve this.  \n\n* John and his peers are able to leverage lab environments to learn about the products (how he learns best).  Listen to his story about using Google products to create a [[COVID-19]] data tracker. \n\n## 21:53 - Cultural Changes in the Move to Google \n\n* The in-office culture required some adjusting, and John came to value it greatly. [[Working In-Office]]\n\n* While he does not miss the commute, he does miss seeing colleagues in person, picking brains, going to lunch with extended team members, etc. \n\n* When you are new to an organization, this is such a valuable experience.  John isn't sure how he did it at VMware without this. \n\n* John was able to shadow people and listen in on calls to help him learn and ramp. \n\n* Over time you start to exercise the right muscles and get better and better. \n\n* The Sales process was different. \n\n* It was brand new to John to be assisting a Salesperson in efforts to drive business and to follow through afterward to help drive consumption. [[Drive Consumption]]\n\n* If customers do not use a service, everyone is unhappy at the end of a subscription term. \n\n* There is an element of customer success to the role.  Finding additional use cases within an organization for a technology already in use helps with the consumption element and provides more value to the customer. \n\n* This seems to allow for flexing a different kind of muscle.  Many of John's customers are greenfield customers (i.e. no significant spend with Google Cloud). \n\n* Only recently has he been involved in the monitoring of consumption. \n\n* Being involved in hiring interviews is not something he did while at VMware.   [[Approaching Interviews]]\n\n* At Google Cloud, none of the interviewing is done by hiring managers as a general rule.  All initial screening and interviews to qualify to get hired at Google is not an area in which hiring managers are involved.  Managers get involved later in the process, however. \n\n* In these initial screenings, interviewers are looking for things like role-related knowledge, general cognitive ability, leadership, and Googlyness. \n\n* In the role-related knowledge interviews, it is usually two people (front line Customer Engineers) interviewing a prospective Customer Engineer. \n\n* In cognitive ability interviews, a front-line Customer Engineer is trying to understand a candidate's thinking and problem solving capabilities. \n\n* Generally leadership and Googlyness screenings are done by a front-line employee. \n\n* That's 4 individual contributors which get involved in the interview process for an incoming Customer Engineer. \n\n* John says there was a great deal of training internally on this which finally helped him understand what the documents he had read from careers.google.com had indicated (seemed a bit opaque at first). \n\n* John has coached a number of people through this process. \n\n* To be clear, John has participated in interviewing candidates who were going only for a Customer Engineer role or the Cloud Architect role (both report to his management chain). \n\n* If you are looking to change jobs (even if not specifically targeting Google), look at the careers.google.com \"How We Hire\" section.  It matches a number of things we have previously discussed on the show and describes the entire hiring process. \n\n* Being a part of the interview process and coaching others through it has made John much more equipped to go through hiring processes in the future. \n\n* The performance review process is very different than he had in previous roles. \n\n* John does not remember ever preparing specific material for reviews at other companies.  He did receive performance feedback from previous managers, but this is very different than Google. \n\n* Google has a twice yearly formal review process which requires deep introspection.  This is something you want to be preparing for on a weekly basis along the way. [[Performance Review]]\n\n* Asking for peer reviews was extremely helpful.   \n\n* The first time John had to do this, it was extremely intimidating.  He was not sure what they were asking him for. \n\n* Despite his manager explaining it clearly, John still had challenges with the process the first time through.  At that point he had only successfully gone through training.  It was challenging to describe an impact and accomplishments. \n\n* This process is not routine (at least for John) an may require he go through it a few more times to get to that point. \n\n* John has a weekly task on Fridays reminding him to pull information out of meetings during the previous week which would be useful for performance review purposes as well as a reminder of exactly what he needs to target. \n\n* John was delivered a performance review yearly before VMware but little more than that. \n\n* Nick shares his experiences with performance reviews (nothing compared to what John has been through at Google). \n\n* John mentioned the official feedback after everything he prepared came at a later time with categories and ratings. \n\n* This seemed to be extremely burdensome on management with the need to provide feedback and justifications for ratings to employees. \n\n* In order to get promoted, John recommends preparing a promotion package which shows you are exceeding the metrics for success in multiple areas.   \n\n* At Google, the feedback ratings are calibrated and standardized across the entire organization (regardless of role, etc.). \n\n## 41:50 - John's Professional Development \n\n* The job description at each level is very clear.  On a weekly basis you want to describe how you are meeting or exceeding those job descriptions (i.e. strongly outperforming a specific metric, etc.). \n\n* Recording things once per week was definitely not something John had previously done but is absolutely the best way to keep your accomplishments top of mind. \n\n* This is near impossible to do well just before review time. \n\n* John has learned to document the things he is doing even better now (account plans, customer overviews, etc.).  In the past these types of documents had an ever changing format.  John chose to create a narrative of his customers with engagement history.  Listen to how he describes it and what gets tracked. \n\n* When reflecting back on it, John isn't sure why he didn't do this before. \n\n* This type of document is also helpful if an account changes hands to another team. \n\n* Staying organized like this has done wonders to help John keep up with tasks. \n\n* John has created a documentation web for each customer that he can share with extended team members to get them up to speed easily. \n\n* Does John see himself moving to a different role within Google at some point? \n\n* It's too early to tell.  He feels he needs to think of himself as an \"Exceeds Expectations\" person in a number of  areas before considering a move.   \n\n* He has potential to be useful in a management position if company growth would allow for it, but again, he wants to first further sharpen his experience and level of excellence as a Customer Engineer (i.e. history of being a strong performer, influence on specific products, etc.). \n\n* No specific product / product line has jumped out as an area in which he would like to at some point specialize.  But, you never know. \n\n* See also our [[Specialist vs. Generalist]] discussion from a [previous episode](INSERT LINK HERE).  \n\n* Is the move to Google what John thought it would be? \n\n* He didn't really know what to expect.  It is normally traumatic to move from a familiar place to something new.  You're walking away from all of the contacts, internal knowledge, and reflexes for navigating an organization. \n\n* It has taken a year for John to understand enough about the organization to be effective.  It had been long enough since joining VMware that he didn't remember how traumatic it was to have zero institutional knowledge. \n\n* John created a document to help others navigate the organization (getting a customer support that is in proof of concept, for example). \n\n## 53:42 - Closing Remarks \n\n* John doesn't want every interaction with his previous teammates to hinge upon  how great Google is.   \n\n* John tries to keep in touch with folks every 6 months or so, but it is not officially tracked in a document.  :) \n\n* Keeping in touch with others can be a challenge when entering a whole new world (new company). \n\n* John suggests we all get organized early on and begin writing the narrative for your review process.  Make it a habit as John wishes he had. \n\n* Begin tracking your work against requirements in the job description for your role on a consistent basis. \n\n* Even if there is no formal review process, it would be extremely powerful to give your manager a packet of information you have written. \n\n* The weekly reflection process may seem like a whip, but get in the habit.  Nick wishes he did it more as well. \n\n* If this is not something you are doing, don't complain when you do not accomplish what you want.   \n\n* This is something you can control relevant to your performance. \n\n* If you do it and get nowhere, you have room to complain.  If you chose not to do something to make it easier for your manager to help you get that next raise or promotion, it's on you. \n\n* If you do in fact get nowhere, there is still a benefit!  This process has written / improved your resume for you.  Getting hired is like a very structured performance review process. \n\n* Episode 100 is coming soon!  We should do something special for it. \n\n## [Contact us](https://twitter.com/NerdJourney) if you need help on the

It can loom and build to the point where it affects mental state, clouds thinking, and affects emotional and physical health.  And watch out for spikes in stress (we will all have them during our career).\n\tIf a company has a crisis playbook, it makes sense to create one for yourself (who to call for which type of support you need whether work / personal / financial, etc.).  And keep it updated.\n\tDo we check in with ourselves on wear and tear?  Think about how things are affecting you and if you are having a physical reaction or avoiding social interaction.  Others may be able to spot this better than us.  Are we eating poorly, sleeping little, or dealing with a lack of energy?  These are all signs.  \n\tExercise, nutrition, hydration, and having a good support network can help!\n\n- [[Episode 70]]\n\t[[Handling Fear and Uncertainty]]\n\tThings we cannot control can overwhelm us and keep us from seeing what we can control - doing our jobs well, enhancing our larger organization (our team of peers and beyond), and helping your network (catching up, lifting others up).

Josh Fidel and his teammates were under immense pressure during long sales cycles and doing activities very visible to leadership.  The amount of travel was 5 days per week and affected home life.  Josh woke up in a hotel room and couldn't remember where he was or why he was there and knew he needed to make a change.  \"I’m building these crystal palaces at the cost of what really matters.\"\n\tJosh had back surgery and took 3 months off.  He did not want to go back and eventually switched jobs into one that allowed more time with family.\n\n- [[Episode 82]]\n\tWhy Vacation Won't Cure Burnout\n\tEffective Mental Health Days Off\n\tWe have trouble not thinking about work while on vacation, but total disconnection can allow decompression time.  Time away may allow pinpointing the problem but does not allow you to fix it.  Josh Fidel took 3 months, but he had to quit his job to fix the problem.\n\tWhile at the office, take breaks to avoid too many consecutive meetings, and defend them when there is a conflict.  Evaluate why you are having trouble completing tasks to get to the root causes of unhappiness (allows you to address it at some point).\n\tSpend time outside, with loved ones / important people, on hobbies, reading, or learning something instead of numbing your mind with nonsense.\n\n- [[Episode 85]] [[Episode 86]]\n\t[[Cody de Arkland]] on Imposter Syndrome, Emotional Tech Support, Verbose Logging, and Debugging\n\tGive yourself room to build up new confidence when starting a new career path / role, and let it be ok to not be confident for a time.  Build on what excites you and the places your confidence comes from.  Have a trusted person for support who can identify with you you are and where you are.  Make it someone who allows you to be your most vulnerable self.  It may be someone different based on whether the issue is work / personal.\n\tRemember to debug yourself with emotional issues.  Find effective strategies for dealing with these things (like Cody de Arkland has shared online).  Don't ever feel alone.\n\n\n- [[Episode 90]]\n\t[[The Inner Game of Stress]]\n\tThe author was a tennis coach who paired with two medical doctors.  Self1 is the critical storyteller (or the stress maker), and Self2 operates in the moment and leverages our natural abilities.\n\tGearing up is when stress piles up long term, and gearing down is using rest, recreation, and reflection to decrease stress.\n\tBe the CEO of your life and own the decisions you make (define life mission like a company, add policies, values, etc.).  Awareness, choice, and trust are all part of the inner game learning code.\n\tTools to use:\n\t\tSTOP - pause, think about the stress, what you want, how to proceed, then do it.\n\t\tThink about what you don't control, what you don't control but keep trying to control, and what you control that you are not presently controlling (all about awareness).\n\t\tTry on a new attitude\n\t\tFree writing / the magic pen\n\t\tTranspose yourself into another person's situation (think, feel, want)\n\t\tRedefine what is happening to help reduce stress\n\t\tRemember PLE (performance, learning, enjoyment) and how much we need all of them\n\tEnter the stres on your own terms.\n\t\t\n\n- [[Episode 91]]\n\t[[Healthy Mind Platter]]\n\tWe can feel like there is no time to switch off.  Does your employer provide for mental health?\n\t7 daily essential mental activities to optimize brain matter and promote wellbeing\n\t\tFocus time (call back to deep work)\n\t\tPlay time (creative)\n\t\tConnecting time (people, in person)\n\t\tPhysical time (move your body through exercise)\n\t\tTime in (reflection)\n\t\tDown time (non-focused, mind wandering)\n\t\tSleep time\n\tHow much time do you spend in each areas?  Are you missing one?\n\n- [[Episode 127]]\n\tCountdown to Burnout with [[Tom Hollingsworth]]\n\tBurnout can creep in because of the stuff on your to-do list you can never get to (starts to eat away at you).  Quitting and moving to a different job won't cure burnout.  The burnout will follow you.  Sometimes we need to say no when we have too much on our plate (hard for people pleasers).\n\tIf someone tells you something is off, LISTEN to them.  Accepting intervention is a gift.\n\tSet manageable, reachable goals and be ok with not making everything a stretch.  If everything is a stretch goal eventually the rubber band will break. Work on stretch goals often enough that it feels like a special occasion and pushes you past boundaries but not so often that it adds stress.  \n\tTake time for self-care despite the voices in your head telling you should be \"doing something.\"  Taking care of yourself should be like billable hours for you (not your employer).  Tom suggests looking at coloring apps, finding a hobby that forces you away from work (for him it is being active in Boy Scouts).\n\n- [[Episode 132]]\n\tRiding the Burnout Wave with [[Jonathan Frappier]]\n\tJonathan didn't know why he was burned out but slowly started peeling things back because he was losing his passion for technology (and did so until there were very few extracurriculars) - blogging was fun until it was turned into a business, vBrownBag stuff being similar to work made it feel like work, he didn't want to go to tech conferences, etc.  \n\tJonathan's daughter wanted to learn to snowboard, and she wanted her parents to do it with her.  This became the thing outside of work that recharged Jonathan.  It’s important now to find something that helps you maintain balance.\n\tAdding things back comes in waves.  Jonathan is figuring out, like surfing, how to see the wave coming without having it knock him over.  Look out for how you are feeling at any given moment.  If beaten down, remember to look for the wave that will come to give you energy to do something new or something you once enjoyed. Don't try to ride every wave.  Awareness of going through the waves allows you to pick yourself up and come out of it.\n\n- [[Episode 166]]\n\t[[Andrew Miller]] on burnout\n\tA hypergrowth startup required Andrew to travel from each to west coast US, and the pace of the work was rapid.  Despite enjoying and appreciate co-workers, he came close to burnout.  \n\tAm I pushing hard enough, do I care enough, can I outwork the pace, and do I care enough about my team (12 direct reports)?\n\tHis kids were growing up, realized he had career options, and wanted to slow his work pace a bit.\n\tWhen you push hard enough for so long it is hard to dial it back (i.e. stress build up).  Andrew needed to take a pause.\n\tWhen your company is growing that fast, it’s like every quarter it is a new company. You’re essentially needing to be in that high energy burst mode all the time.\n\n- [[Episode 179]]\n\t[[Nick Korte]] almost burning out\nNick didn't want to quit the tour like John Mellencamp.  \"That could be me.\"  \nA disconnected vacation at an inconvenient time (supported by management) allowed a re-read of [[The Practice]].  This was a time of change (daughter changing schools, worship service concerns) and a feeling of overwhelm at work (late nights, early mornings).  \nThe feedback Nick was given was that he did not always need to go straight to the sandpaper on the material (not afraid of the hard work).  Nick started doing morning pages for some relief and some distance and was more intentional with sleep - a boundary, more focus time.  It creates time for reflection and creativity (rest).\nListened back to [[Jonathan Frappier]], [[Chris Wahl]], [[Tom Hollingsworth]]\n\n\n- [[Episode 181]] [[Episode 182]]\n\t[[Bill Kindle]] on Burnout\n\tBill reached a career crisis and started second guessing IT as a career (lost the love).  There was not a way for him to move up in his current company, and he was not given a chance. He was bored.  He got depressed and work quality declined.  He had stopped writing and other extracurriculars.\n\tAttending a VMUG to speak to John and Kat Troyer was therapeutic.  \"It's not your fault that they are not utilizing your skills.\"\n\tBill needed other outlets like learning and sharing (writing).  He found new communities in which to participate, got a degree, and got certifications...all in an effort to eventually make a move elsewhere.\n\tBill helped lead the Fort Wayne VMUG and uses Kanban for work visualization.  He had the opportunity to contribute to PowerShell books also.\n\t\n\t","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.046589096Z","tags":null},"/MOC-Communicating-With-Your-Management":{"title":"MOC - Communicating With Your Management","content":"\n# MOC - Communicating With Your Management\n\n## General\n- [[Episode 83]] [[Episode 84]] [[Brad Pinkston]] Transitioning to a new manager; Find out how your new boss prefers to be communicated with (improves relationship)\n- [[Episode 172]] [[Evan Oldford]] Daily Report to management as a shutdown routine (report containing no more than 5 concise points that add insight and could be read while waiting to get coffee at Starbucks) with BLUF (bottom line up front) to ensure no one misses (i.e. danger of missing a project deadline, context of customer CSAT issue, etc.).

Let others know too.  If you don't sell yourself, no one will.  Brad struggles with getting his people to cheerlead for themselves. He tells his team to make a folder and call it I Love Me.

They know more about what management in that organization is like than you do.\n- [[Episode 51]] [[Charlie Nichol]]'s manager encouraged him to look into leadership/management even though Charlie was a SE and saw himself as someone who should stay close to the technology. Trusting your manager's instincts.  In Charlie's case, his manager groomed him and allowed him to take on management type tasks.\n- [[Episode 83]] [[Brad Pinkston]] talked to his manager about his desire to become a manager and received support to actually get the position.\n- [[Episode 115]] [[Jeff Eberhard]] after 9 months as a VMware SE asked his boss to be considered to lead a new team that was forming and was told no (boss thought the team would take him seriously).  Jeff also got feedback from his peers that the move to leadership was a good idea, which he took back to his boss, went through a formal process, and was given the job.   Jeff says if you have someone on your team that wants to move into leadership, it makes your job as a leader easier.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.046589096Z","tags":null},"/MOC-Deep-Work-for-Job-Excellence":{"title":"MOC - Deep Work for Job Excellence","content":"\n# MOC - Deep Work for Job Excellence\n\n\n1) [[Episode 108]] Original mention by Nick as a book goal for 2021\n   From a [[Deliberate Practice]] reading list by [[James Clear]]\n2) [[Episode 124]] [[Josh Duffney]] mentioned the concept and the book and applying it to his output\n3) [[Episode 138]] [[Don Jones]] mentions the ideas of quantifying time spent doing different things, stripping away the ones that aren't providing value, and scheduling everything, very much Deep Work concepts.\n4) [[Episode 140]] [[Eric Brooker]] mentioned focus.

A manager may have role power but lack a network and relationships.  [[Episode 58]]\n\n[[Don Jones]] also says that mangement and leadership are two separate things.

It was a step removed from technology. It required a different skill set, almost unrelated to the individual contributor role, other than being able to conceptually understand what the ICs were doing. [[Episode 42]]\n\n[[Don Jones]] mentions that managers are dependent on their team for their success, not themselves. They're also removed from whether any particular day went well (and might not find out for weeks or months!). It's a different job with different skills. [[Episode 137]]\n\n[[Charlie Nichol]] knew how to motivate top performers because he was one but lacked the ability to motivate those not performing well at first (i.e. not everyone is motivated by the same thing).  Managers take care of many things that happen, but we might not see that they did it (i.e. making sure someone gets paid for coming to work on their first day).   Charlie took the aspects of every good manager he had met and developed his own methodology.  Management is like parenting in that way (take all the good you see from others and create your own, cannot know what it is like until you do it).  You are no longer an expert on technology.   [[Episode 51]]\n\n[[Brad Christian]] realized with a team you can widen the impact and scope of what you can accomplish, especially with a high performance team.  Brad learns from his team and considers himself a servant leader.  Management is also a path to more money.  Brad’s goal is to remove impediments from the team and help them do their job better. If you can do that and enjoy it and hold onto your technical skills a little, you can be successful.

As the world becomes more distracting with social media and smart phones, the ability to concentrate will lead to premium positions and premium concentration.\n\n- [[Episode 108]] Original mention by Nick as a book goal for 2021\n   From a [[Deliberate Practice]] reading list by [[James Clear]]\n- [[Episode 124]] [[Josh Duffney]] mentioned the concept and the book and applying it to his output\n- [[Episode 138]] [[Don Jones]] mentions the ideas of quantifying time spent doing different things, stripping away the ones that aren't providing value, and scheduling everything, very much Deep Work concepts.\n- [[Episode 140]] [[Eric Brooker]] mentioned focus. Mentioned successful people who only checked email once or twice a day. This reminded Nick of Deep Work.\n- [[Episode 141]] [[Episode 142]] [[Episode 143]] [[Episode 144]] [[Episode 145]] [[Episode 146]] [[Episode 147]] Our discussions of the book\n- [[Episode 149]] [[Chris Wahl]] ditched social media, focuses on solving cool problems, and removed distractions. We told him about the book and he wrote a blog post after he read it.\n- [[Episode 153]] [[Scott Lowe]] talked about paring down the things he focuses on and puts a premium on making the most of his time. Read another Cal Newport book and was planning on reading Deep Work.\n- [[Episode 156]] [[Episode 157]] [[Josh Duffney]] returns, connecting Deep Work with Smart Notes. The book he was working on, Reclaim, incorporates Deep Work focus without needing to retreat into being a hermit to accomplish hard work. \n- [[Episode 160]] [[Andy Syrewicze]] mentions the skill required to do nothing, reminding us of Cal Newport's charge to be OK with being bored. The dopamine hit of filling time with distraction leads to a dependence on distraction, the enemy of deep work.\n- [[Episode 173]] [[Evan Oldford]] mentioned his practice of working on a problem immediately before bed, then waking up with an epiphany, letting his subconsciousness work on making connections, similar to the Deep Work idea, \"Downtime Aids Insights\".\n- [[Episode 183]] [[Episode 184]] [[Michael Levan]] connected getting to Deep Work through a series of iterative changes, connecting Deep Work as a goal using Atomic Habits.\n\n\n## Smart Notes for Job Excellence\n- [[How to Take Smart Notes]] by [[Sonke Ahrens]]\n- Doing your best knowledge work requires that as you ingest information, you record the information in your own words, and store it in a manner, that allows you to recall, connect, link, and publish. This concept is a stand in for the idea that real understanding of concepts comes not only from consuming them, but also recording them and teaching them. The first student is a future version of yourself who only dimly remembers the context of the information in question.\n\n- Example of the Nerd Journey podcast and the show notes, restating the discussions.\n- Highlighting the Show Notes and extracted concepts in Obsidian\n- Announcing that we'll publish the information and graph\n\n- [[Episode 148]] [[Chris Wahl]] mentioned a note-taking system incorporating labels and color-coding to remember and find things which reminded John of a Zettelkasten. Everything goes into his notes system because he won't know what's valuable until later. He also describes that writing out concepts forces you to think more deeply about the topic and perhap even improve your understanding of it, structurally and contextually.\n- [[Episode 156]] [[Episode 157]] [[Josh Duffney]] links Zettelkasten with Deep Work. He was so inspired that he wrote a short book about implementing the system in Obsidian.\n- [[Episode 172]] [[Evan Oldford]] commented on the intensity of the notes that went into reading Deep Work. That was done using the Smart Notes methodology. We built the episodes by reacting to literature notes John wrote.\n- [[Episode 178]] [[Stephanie Wong]] discussed how real learning comes from not just reading something, but retrieving the information, processing it, and teaching it back to others. Smart Notes are exactly this process, where the first student is the future you.\n- [[Episode 186]] [[Phil Monk]] described the memory palace technique, which reminds John of the spacial or graph view of a Zettelkasten.\n\n## Show Your Work for Job Excellence\n- [[Show Your Work]] by [[Austin Kleon]]\n- Influence others by publishing. People want to follow the path of other beginners in a subject, not experts who can't always relate to being a beginner. [[Curse of Knowledge]] \n\n### Communicate With Your Management\n\n### Publish\n- [[Episode 1]] Both hosts pointed to their community participation and blogging as proof of work and career accelerators. \n- [[Episode 8]] Raising your Impact Radius by investing in participation, blogging, and conference or community meetup speaking\n- [[Episode 13]] [[Tom Delicati]]'s sniper approach to job applications builds on proof of expertise via user community involvement - target companies you know use the product you're an expert in.\n- [[Episode 38]] [[Jon Hildebrand]] mentioning how his manager saw his blogging as evidence of the potential to work on a bigger stage doing great things (our words, not his).\n- [[Episode 119]] [[David Klee]] discussed how his blogging and community involvement helped build a reputation \n- [[Episode 131]] [[Jonathan Frappier]] used blogging as a way to store knowledge and experience, then found that it brought some recognition and helped him make moves to bigger organizations.\n\n### Beginner Mindset\n### Smart Kid Syndrome\n### No Growth Without Discomfort\n- [[Episode 5]] First mention of \"You'll be bad at first.\"\n- [[Episode 10]] John's Journeyman Mindset, \"If I'm an expert at anything, it's that I'm now comfortable not being an expert at a new thing.\"\n- [[Episode 18a]] [[Episode 18b]] [[Joseph Griffiths]] Discomfort is natural when engaging in professional development.\n- [[Episode 80]] Side mention of \"Smart Kid Syndrome.\" If you've been praised an have ego invested in appearing smart/good, you'll avoid new things. Because you'll probably be bad at first.\n- [[Episode 106]] [[Steven Murawski]] and the Beginner Mindset. Willingness to be a beginner and asking dumb questions as a career enabler. Beginner doesn't mean inexperienced. Bringing the depth of your experience and related experiences. [[Episode 107]] is all about Steven's application of that mindset to major job transitions.\n- [[Episode 117]] [[Kate Emshoff]]  mentiontions that the discomfort with not fitting in at an organization has a flip side: Standing out. \n- [[Episode 136]] [[Blake Johnson]] \n\t`If I stayed comfortable, I would be who I was ten years ago.  And that's not acceptable.`\n- [[Episode 153]] [[Scott Lowe]] discusses the balance between discomfort while you're learning a new skill and the danger of waiting too long, when it's become passe and not a differentiator in the marketplace.\n- [[Episode 177]] [[Stephanie Wong]] refers to the first pancake principle. It's always ugly, but you have to do it to get better.\n- [[Episode 182]] [[Blake Johnson]] mentions that taking chances and discomfort is the way to get out of a rut (being in a place where you're so comfortable that you're bored).\n- [[Episode 73]] [[Episode 74]] [[Al Rasheed]]'s fist-hand story of getting to come to VMworld 2017 for the first time via community interaction and his spreadsheet of people to meet. How VMUG involvement has led to multiple community advocacy program memberships. Leading to conference presentations. The opportunities to give and receive mentorship.\n- [[Episode 80]] [[Episode 81]] [[Manny Sidhu]] mentioned how keeping involved in communities helps him find the right technology waves to invest in.\n- [[Episode 86]] [[Cody de Arkland]] mentions the parallel between projects at work and in the community as a portfolio of your work.\n- [[Episode 88]] [[Episode 89]] [[Yadin Porter de Leon]] starts with the benefit of professional networking then discusses how blogging, podcasting, and other community involvement act as a scaled-up version of networking. Networking that can act passively while you sleep.\n\n\n### Community\n- [[Bonus Episode 5]] [[Al Rasheed]]'s first VMworld came from community involvement.\n- [[Bonus Episode 6]] Observation that the people in the vCommunity and vBrownBag area were placing a much higher priority on professional networking, which is a career accelerator.\n- [[Episode 32]] [[Episode 33]] [[Tony Reeves]] discussed community participation and conference attendance as a job accelerator. Getting picked for an Advocacy program helped especially.\n- [[Episode 34]] [[Episode 35]] [[Jimmy Tassin]]'s involvement in the Minecraft community as a resume builder.\n- [[Episode 39]] [[Paul Woodward Jr.]] of the ExploreVM Podcast saw online community participation as a way to see more types of problems than the ones at your workplace.\n- [[Episode 41]] [[Presentations]] We discussed the career benefits in our episode on doing presentations.\n- [[Episode 43]] [[Ethan Banks]] discussed blogging as an accountability mechanism for his [[CCIE]] [[Certification Study]]. That led to podcasting, which led to a business.\n- [[Episode 45]] Side projects can help build skills for your career.\n- [[Episode 46]] [[Keiran Shelden]]'s blogging got him invited to Tech Field Day and Storage Field day. It's a way of positioning yourself as a thought leader. That's a phrase that people equate with expert, but maybe we should take it literally, someone who shows leadership in their thinking, not expertise.\n- [[Episode 60]] [[Episode 61]] [[Amy Hervey]]'s discussion about [[Personal Brand]] and self-marketing. Showing your work is part of marketing yourself and your brand.\n- [[Episode 106]] [[Episode 107]] [[Steven Murawski]] discussed how his advancement was intertwined with his involvement in tech communities.\n- [[Episode 123]] [[Episode 124]] [[Josh Duffney]] talked about Community being the incubator for his career. to writing courses at pluralsight. eventually Microsoft.\n- [[Episode 138]] [[Don Jones]] talks about his method of helping people succeed is building a community.\n\n## Atomic Habits for Job Excellence\n- [[Atomic Habits]] by [[James Clear]]\n- Improvement comes from small, incremental steps. Improving 1% every day has a compounding effect. So making tiny, easy changes that last and build upon each other can have a profound effect. Math! This is a stand-in for incremental and iterative changes.\n\n- [[Episode 18b]] [[Joseph Griffiths]] mentions that there aren't short cuts to iterate on one's career. Learning and getting better takes time, and is an iterative process.\n- [[Episode 57]] The idea of making changes in personal spending by removing small indulgences, one at a time. \"The Latte Effect\"\n- [[Episode 106]] [[Steven Murawski]] and incremental changes over time.  \n\t`It's not that I need to be perfect tomorrow.  I need to be a little bit better than I was today.`\n- [[Episode 135]] - [[Blake Johnson]] discussed small, incremental change as the key to make lasting changes.\n- [[Episode 143]] [[Nick Korte]] while discussing [[Deep Work]], noted that the only way to get to the profoundly different lifestyle that the author described was the get there incrementally.\n- [[Episode 148]] [[Chris Wahl]] states the the process of writing is also iterative. You start with something and never end with it. There's always a process of incremental change and self-exploration.\n- [[Episode 183]] [[Michael Levan]] is a DevOps guy, who told us that he thinks the path to success is a series of iterative, modular changes that need to be examined individually to see if they result in an improvement. He was talking about fitness, so you can see that the small, incremental approach can cross knowledge domains.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.054589206Z","tags":null},"/Speaker-Notes-Burnout":{"title":"Speaker Notes - Burnout","content":"\n# Speaker Notes - Burnout\n\n- [[Episode 58#^515deb]] [[Kelly Schroeder]] Burnout and the Path to Healing\n- Taking responsibilities outside his skillset caused Kelly to burn out (pay raise, security clearance upgrade in exchange for a 2 year grind).\n- Personal issues compounded the situation, and Kelly eventually resigned.  \n- Even after Kelly's boss removed the responsibilities Kelly struggled with, he found he still hated his job and needed a change.  This led to 18 months of unemployement with 16 months of no interviews.  He focused on what interested him at first and then anything that could pay the bills.  The reason for the dry spell was he needed to change the way he wrote his resume.\n\n- [[Episode 68]]\n[[Work-Life Balance]], Personal Crisis Playbook, Handling Stress\nConstant low-level stress can be overlooked as a destructive force.  It can loom and build to the point where it affects mental state, clouds thinking, and affects emotional and physical health.  And watch out for spikes in stress (we will all have them during our career).\nIf a company has a crisis playbook, it makes sense to create one for yourself (who to call for which type of support you need whether work / personal / financial, etc.).  And keep it updated.\nDo we check in with ourselves on wear and tear?  Think about how things are affecting you and if you are having a physical reaction or avoiding social interaction.  Others may be able to spot this better than us.  Are we eating poorly, sleeping little, or dealing with a lack of energy?  These are all signs.  \nExercise, nutrition, hydration, and having a good support network can help!\n\n- [[Episode 70]]\n\t[[Handling Fear and Uncertainty]]\n\tThings we cannot control can overwhelm us and keep us from seeing what we can control - doing our jobs well, enhancing our larger organization (our team of peers and beyond), and helping your network (catching up, lifting others up).  This has shades of Give and Take by Adam Grant even though we had not read it before this episode.\n\n- [[Episode 78]]\nBurnout and Recovery with [[Josh Fidel]]\nLoving your job isn't enough to prevent burnout when other priorities slip.  Josh Fidel and his teammates were under immense pressure during long sales cycles and doing activities very visible to leadership.  The amount of travel was 5 days per week and affected home life.  Josh woke up in a hotel room and couldn't remember where he was or why he was there and knew he needed to make a change.  \"I’m building these crystal palaces at the cost of what really matters.\"\nJosh had back surgery and took 3 months off.  He did not want to go back and eventually switched jobs into one that allowed more time with family.\n\n- [[Episode 82]]\nWhy Vacation Won't Cure Burnout\nEffective Mental Health Days Off\nWe have trouble not thinking about work while on vacation, but total disconnection can allow decompression time.  Time away may allow pinpointing the problem but does not allow you to fix it.  Josh Fidel took 3 months, but he had to quit his job to fix the problem.\nWhile at the office, take breaks to avoid too many consecutive meetings, and defend them when there is a conflict.  Evaluate why you are having trouble completing tasks to get to the root causes of unhappiness (allows you to address it at some point).\nSpend time outside, with loved ones / important people, on hobbies, reading, or learning something instead of numbing your mind with nonsense.\n\n- [[Episode 85]] [[Episode 86]]\n[[Cody de Arkland]] on Imposter Syndrome, Emotional Tech Support, Verbose Logging, and Debugging\nGive yourself room to build up new confidence when starting a new career path / role, and let it be ok to not be confident for a time.  Build on what excites you and the places your confidence comes from.  Have a trusted person for support who can identify with you you are and where you are.  Make it someone who allows you to be your most vulnerable self.  It may be someone different based on whether the issue is work / personal.\nRemember to debug yourself with emotional issues.  Find effective strategies for dealing with these things (like Cody de Arkland has shared online).  Don't ever feel alone.\n\n\n- [[Episode 90]]\n[[The Inner Game of Stress]]\nThe author was a tennis coach who paired with two medical doctors.  Self1 is the critical storyteller (or the stress maker), and Self2 operates in the moment and leverages our natural abilities.\nGearing up is when stress piles up long term, and gearing down is using rest, recreation, and reflection to decrease stress.\nBe the CEO of your life and own the decisions you make (define life mission like a company, add policies, values, etc.).  Awareness, choice, and trust are all part of the inner game learning code.\nTools to use:\n- STOP - pause, think about the stress, what you want, how to proceed, then do it.\n- Think about what you don't control, what you don't control but keep trying to control, and what you control that you are not presently controlling (all about awareness).\n- Try on a new attitude\n- Free writing / the magic pen\n- Transpose yourself into another person's situation (think, feel, want)\n- Redefine what is happening to help reduce stress\n- Remember PLE (performance, learning, enjoyment) and how much we need all of them\nEnter the stres on your own terms.\n\n\n- [[Episode 91]]\n[[Healthy Mind Platter]]\nWe can feel like there is no time to switch off.  Does your employer provide for mental health?\n7 daily essential mental activities to optimize brain matter and promote wellbeing\n- Focus time (call back to deep work)\n- Play time (creative)\n- Connecting time (people, in person)\n- Physical time (move your body through exercise)\n- Time in (reflection)\n- Down time (non-focused, mind wandering)\n- Sleep time\nHow much time do you spend in each areas?  Are you missing one?\n\n- [[Episode 127]]\nCountdown to Burnout with [[Tom Hollingsworth]]\nBurnout can creep in because of the stuff on your to-do list you can never get to (starts to eat away at you).  Quitting and moving to a different job won't cure burnout.  The burnout will follow you.  Sometimes we need to say no when we have too much on our plate (hard for people pleasers).\nIf someone tells you something is off, LISTEN to them.  Accepting intervention is a gift.\nSet manageable, reachable goals and be ok with not making everything a stretch.  If everything is a stretch goal eventually the rubber band will break. Work on stretch goals often enough that it feels like a special occasion and pushes you past boundaries but not so often that it adds stress.  \nTake time for self-care despite the voices in your head telling you should be \"doing something.\"  Taking care of yourself should be like billable hours for you (not your employer).  Tom suggests looking at coloring apps, finding a hobby that forces you away from work (for him it is being active in Boy Scouts).\n\n- [[Episode 132]]\nRiding the Burnout Wave with [[Jonathan Frappier]]\nJonathan didn't know why he was burned out but slowly started peeling things back because he was losing his passion for technology (and did so until there were very few extracurriculars) - blogging was fun until it was turned into a business, vBrownBag stuff being similar to work made it feel like work, he didn't want to go to tech conferences, etc.  \nJonathan's daughter wanted to learn to snowboard, and she wanted her parents to do it with her.  This became the thing outside of work that recharged Jonathan.  It’s important now to find something that helps you maintain balance.\nAdding things back comes in waves.  Jonathan is figuring out, like surfing, how to see the wave coming without having it knock him over.  Look out for how you are feeling at any given moment.  If beaten down, remember to look for the wave that will come to give you energy to do something new or something you once enjoyed. Don't try to ride every wave.  Awareness of going through the waves allows you to pick yourself up and come out of it.\n\n- [[Episode 166]]\n[[Andrew Miller]] on burnout\nA hypergrowth startup required Andrew to travel from each to west coast US, and the pace of the work was rapid.  Despite enjoying and appreciate co-workers, he came close to burnout.  \nAm I pushing hard enough, do I care enough, can I outwork the pace, and do I care enough about my team (12 direct reports)?\nHis kids were growing up, realized he had career options, and wanted to slow his work pace a bit.\nWhen you push hard enough for so long it is hard to dial it back (i.e. stress build up).  Andrew needed to take a pause.\nWhen your company is growing that fast, it’s like every quarter it is a new company. You’re essentially needing to be in that high energy burst mode all the time.\n\n- [[Episode 179]]\n[[Nick Korte]] almost burning out\nNick didn't want to quit the tour like John Mellencamp.  \"That could be me.\"  \nA disconnected vacation at an inconvenient time (supported by management) allowed a re-read of [[The Practice]].  This was a time of change (daughter changing schools, worship service concerns) and a feeling of overwhelm at work (late nights, early mornings).  \nThe feedback Nick was given was that he did not always need to go straight to the sandpaper on the material (not afraid of the hard work).  Nick started doing morning pages for some relief and some distance and was more intentional with sleep - a boundary, more focus time.  It creates time for reflection and creativity (rest).\nListened back to [[Jonathan Frappier]], [[Chris Wahl]], [[Tom Hollingsworth]]\n\n\n- [[Episode 181]] [[Episode 182]]\n[[Bill Kindle]] on Burnout\nBill reached a career crisis and started second guessing IT as a career (lost the love).  There was not a way for him to move up in his current company, and he was not given a chance. He was bored.  He got depressed and work quality declined.  He had stopped writing and other extracurriculars.\nAttending a VMUG to speak to John and Kat Troyer was therapeutic.  \"It's not your fault that they are not utilizing your skills.\"\nBill needed other outlets like learning and sharing (writing).  He found new communities in which to participate, got a degree, and got certifications...all in an effort to eventually make a move elsewhere.\nBill helped lead the Fort Wayne VMUG and uses Kanban for work visualization.  He had the opportunity to contribute to PowerShell books also.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.054589206Z","tags":null},"/Speaker-Notes-Condensed":{"title":"Speaker Notes - Condensed","content":"\n# Speaker Notes - Condensed\n\n## Intro\n### John\nWelcome everyone to Adventures in Technical Career Progression! I'm your host, John White, former VMware Staff Solution Engineer, current Google Cloud Customer Engineer, @vJourneyman on twitter.\n### Nick\n\t``\n## Disclaimer\nWe won't be talking about product.\n\n## Who are we?\n### John\nWe've been releasing the Nerd Journey Podcast weekly for the past four years.\n\n### Nick\nThat's just about 200 total episodes across 55 guests. \n\n### John\nWe've been looking for the career advice we wish we'd been given, earlier in our careers.\n### Nick\nUltimately, we're just two nerds on a journey.\n### John\nA journey to career enlightenment.\n### Nick\nSo let's take a trip!\n\n\n## Agenda\nx### John\nLet me just spend a second on the format. We're going to do about 45 mins of talking and 15 min of questions.\n\n### Nick\nAnd I've got a session in Moscone South I have to get to right after this one, so I can't stay and talkin the hallway, but you can, right John?\n### John\nAbsolutely. Happy to stay and chat.\n\n### Nick\nGlad one of us can. \nAs for the content, we're bringing you the collective wisdom of our guests.\n### John\nRight, the patterns we noticed emerging.\n### Nick\nPoll: People Management\n### John\nPoll: Becoming a Top Level IC\n### Nick\nPoll: Burnout\n### John\nPoll: Need to find a way in, when you didn't have the exact experience a roll asked for?\n### Nick\nSprinkling management communication and lateral moves throughout, but if it feels like we didn't cover what you want from that, feel free to ask a question during Q\u0026A.\n\n\n\n## People Management Career Path\n [[Speaker Notes - People Management Career]]\n\n### Managing People is a Different Skill Set from being an IC\n\n### John\n- Graph diagram\n- [[Ethan Banks]] is co-founder of Packet Pushers Interactive; Host or co-hosts podcasts about IT for architects and engineers on shows such as [[Heavy Networking]] and [[Day Two Cloud]].\n- Pointed out that manager of a tech team isn't a super-tech lead.  \n### Nick\n- Administrative, resource coordination. \n### John\n- I think he said he hated it, because it didn't meet what his expectations were.\n### Nick\n- [[Don Jones]] was a VP at Pluralsight when we talked to him, now VP of Content at Karat, and mentioned that managers are dependent on their team for their success, not themselves. \n- No feel for day-to-day success.\n### John\n- Different job with different skills\n- When we originally talked to [[Charlie Nichol]], he was a Senior Manager of Solution Engineering at VMware. He's currently a Regional VP for Sales Engineering at Rubrik.\n- You are no longer an expert at technology.\n- He also talked about motivating people who are different from you.\n### Nick\n- When we talked to [[Brad Christian]], he was a Solution Engineering Manager at VMware. He's currently a Product Marketing Manager at DataStax.\n- His goal is to remove impediments from the team and help them do their job better. \n- Do that and enjoy it and hold onto your technical skills a little, you can be successful.\n### John\n- [[Jeff Eberhard]] was a Solution Engineering Leader at VMware when we spoke to him. He's currently a Cloud Sales and Engineering Leader at Oracle.\n- He had to learn how to manage people significantly older than him.  \"How do I lead someone who has been doing this since before I was born?\"\n- Let's generalize that, how do you lead someone who's more technically proficient than you? The answer is that leadership and management are different skills sets than technical proficiency.\n\n### Managment vs Leadership\n### Nick\n [[Brad Pinkston]] is a Director of Partnerships at Decisionlink, though he was \n- a Director of Global Solutions Consulting at VMware when we spoke to him\n- \"You don't have to be a manager to be a leader.\" \n- Leadership is inspiring, teaching, mentoring, coaching, and supporting your colleagues. \n### John\n- Management adds the tasks of hiring, firing, performance management and excercise of role power to support the team.\n- Role power expectation. Role power vs relationship power.\n## Nick\n[[Don Jones]] also says that mangement and leadership are two separate things. You can lead as a peer, without being the boss. Managers handle resource allocation, measurement, etc.\n### John\n- [[Scott Lowe]] is a Principal Technical Content Engineer, and was a Principal Field Engineer when we talked to him.\n- Re-states the point about leadership being different than management. Part of the leadership task is helping others be more effective in their roles without being their manager.\n\n## Characteristics of Good Managers\n### Nick\n- [[Kelly Schroeder]] is currently Director of IT at Colorado Early Colleges.\n- Observed a manager very clearly cared about the wellbeing of the team and it's memebers, both personally and professionally. Carries that with him today.\n### John\n- [[Paul Green]] is Chief Development Officer at Angel MedFlight, having also held the CIO role.\n- Coaching vs Solving Problems. Helps reports think through how to solve a problem rather than solving it for them\n- Connect employee responsibilities with the company achieving it's goals.\n### Nick\n- Back to [[Jeff Eberhard]].\n- Interested in personal connection with their reports\n- An interest in helping people develop their strong points as well as their weaknesses\n- An understanding of the individual's abilities as a contributor\n### John\n- We spoke with [[Evan Oldford]], Senior Director of Engineering at Cisco and author of 'Ghost Rules: Unspoken secrets to getting ahead'\n- Great managers remember great talent and want to bring you with them.\n\n## Actions\n## Communicating With Your Management\n### Nick\n- Talk to your manager about your career goals\n- [[Ethan Banks]] implies that you should actually listen to warnings your manager has about becoming a manager.\n### John\n- [[Charlie Nichol]]'s manager encouraged him to look into leadership/management\n- Trust your manager's instincts\n- Got exposure and took on managerial tasks.\n### Nick\n- [[Brad Pinkston]] and [[Jeff Eberhard]] both had conversations with ther managers about making the jump to Manager from IC. \n- Good managers will give opportunities to take on leadership tasks to get experience.\n### John\nDidn't Jeff overcome an early \"soft no\" by having those conversations?\n## Nick\n- Story about Jeff collecting endorsements from peers about the potential move, which helped overcome the soft \"no\".\n## Management Interviews\n### John\n- [[Brad Pinkston]] process of preparing for a management interview that was just as systematic as preparing for a certification exam.\n- Study, peer group prep, mock interviews, interviewing people who had the job already.\n### Nick\n- [[Charlie Nichol]] knew the management position was opening up, so had unofficial discussions with each stakeholder ahead of time. \n- Even got endorsements to apply from them ahead of time.\n\n### John\n# Becoming a Top Tier Individual Contributor\n\n### Intro\nWe saw these four patterns, and mapped them to four books on the topic. They're just the ones we picked to call out the topic, but we're sure there are others. In fact, if you know of them, we want to hear about them.\n\n### Deep Work for Job Excellence\n\n### John\n\n[[Deep Work]] is a book by Cal Newport. The thesis is that high value, difficult work requires intense and intentional focus.  Individual contributors can leverage this idea to build personal brand and accomplish the important things.\n\n### Nick\n[[Eric Brooker]] is VP of Strategic Partnerships at Bluewave Technologies and gave examples of successful people he knew that only checked e-mail a couple of times per day.\n\n### John\n[[Don Jones]] suggests we should quantify time spent doing different things, removing the items that are less valuable, and scheduling everything.\n\n\n### Nick\nSpeaking of time tracking, [[Chris Wahl]], Senior Delivery Principal at Slalom, found he was spending hours per day on social media and decided to focus on solving cool problems and removing distractions.  He even wrote a great blog post after reading [[Deep Work]] by Cal Newport.\n\n### John\n[[Andy Syrewicze]], Tech Evangelist at Hornet Security, mentions the skill required to do nothing, reminding us of Cal Newport's charge to be OK with being bored. The dopamine hit of filling time with distraction leads to a dependence on distraction, the enemy of deep work.  [[Evan Oldford]] often works on a problem right before bed, allowing his subconscious to work on it while sleeping (often resulting in a morning epiphany)\n\n## Show Your Work\n### Publishing and Community\n### Nick\nWe're showing our work here, right John?\n### John\nThat's right. All our notes, including our speaker notes are going to be published at graph.nerd-journey.com. It'll be live by the end of the conference. This is based on the ideas from **Show Your Work by Austin Kleon**.\n### Nick\n[[Jon Hildebrand]], Principal Technologist at Cohesity, mentioning how his manager saw his blogging as evidence of the potential to work on a bigger stage doing great things (our words, not his).\n\n### John\n[[David Klee]], founder of Heraflux Technologies, discussed how his blogging and community involvement helped build a reputation\n\n### Nick\n[[Jonathan Frappier]] used blogging as a way to store knowledge and experience, then found that it brought some recognition and helped him make moves to bigger organizations.  He was also a part of vBrownBag and the vExpert communities which boosted network connections and encouraged learning (started hosting some of the vBrownBag shows).\n\n## Beginner Mindset\n## Smart Kid Syndrome\n## No Growth Without Discomfort\n### John\nPeople want to learn from recent beginners as well as experts. Beginners can empathize with the frustrations and missing context that beginners face.\n### Nick\nDon't you have a saying about fear of being bad?\n### John\nOh right. Don't fear being bad at something. You definitely will be. Embrace and accept it.\nSmart Kid Syndrome\n### Nick\n[[Steven Murawski]] mentioned the willingness to be a beginner and asking dumb questions as a career enabler. Beginner doesn't mean inexperienced. Bringing the depth of your experience and related experiences.\n### John\n[[Scott Lowe]] mentioned the balance between discomfort while you're learning a skill and waiting too long to discuss it, when it's become passe.\n### Nick\n[[Stephanie Wong]] is the Head of Developer Engagement at Google Cloud. She talked about the first pancake principle: It's always going to be bad, but you've got to get it out of the way.\n### John\n[[Chris Wahl]] ditched social media, focuses on solving cool problems, and removed distractions. We told him about the book and he wrote a blog post after he read it.\n\n## Smart Notes\n### Nick\nThis idea is based on the book, **How to Take Smart Notes** by Sonke Ahrens.\n### John\nThat's right. He says that great output comes from great thinking. Great thinking comes from great writing. And great writing comes from taking smart notes while you're consuming information. \nSmart notes are \n- Atomic Thoughts\n- In your own words\n- Connected to other thoughts\nThe graphs you see on these slides are examples of Smart Notes. We used a program called Obsidian, but there's a bunch of tools out there that you could do this with.\n### Nick\n[[Chris Wahl]] mentioned a note-taking system incorporating labels and color-coding to remember and find things.\n- you won't know what's important until later\n- writing in your own words forces deeper thought and understanding of the subject\n### John\n[[Josh Duffney]] is a Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft, and was the one who originally introduced us to the Deep Work concept we talked about earlier. He was so galvanized by the idea of Smart Notes that he wrote a short book on how to implement the system with Obsidian.\n### Nick\n[[Stephanie Wong]] discussed how real learning comes from not just reading something, but retrieving the information, processing it, and teaching it back to others.\n\n### John\n## Atomic Habits\n[[Atomic Habits]] by [[James Clear]]\n\nImprovement comes from small, incremental steps. Improving 1% every day has a compounding effect. So making tiny, easy changes that last and build upon each other can have a profound effect.\n### Nick\n[[Joseph Griffiths]] mentions that there aren't short cuts to iterate on one's career. Learning and getting better takes time, and is an iterative process.\n### John\n[[Steven Murawski]] and incremental changes over time.  \n\t`It's not that I need to be perfect tomorrow.  I need to be a little bit better than I was today.`\n### Nick\nWe had two people mention this idea for fitness as well.\n[[Blake Johnson]] discussed small, incremental change as the key to make lasting changes. [[Michael Levan]] talked about a series of iterative, modular changes, individually measured. But he's also a DevOps consultant as well as a fitness guy, so that makes sense.\n\n\n---\n\n# Burnout\n### John\nWe can get anxiety and feel fear from those things we cannot control. Things like doing our jobs well, enhancing our larger organization (our team of peers and beyond), and helping your network (catching up, lifting others up).  [[The Inner Game of Stress]] by [[Tim Gallwey]], a tennis coach who paired with medical professionals to write this book, encourages us to think about what you don't control, what you don't control but keep trying to control, and what you control that you are not presently controlling (all about awareness).\n\n### Nick\n[[Tom Hollingsworth]], Network Analyst and Tech Field Day Event Lead, says we cannot always be chasing a stretch goal - set manageable, reachable goals and be ok with not making everything a stretch.  If everything is a stretch goal eventually the rubber band will break. Work on stretch goals often enough that it feels like a special occasion and pushes you past boundaries but not so often that it adds stress.  \n\n### John\n[[Jonathan Frappier]], Senior Product Education Engineer at HashiCorp, stresses the important of finding something to help maintain balance.  He slowly peeled back extracurricular activities after almost losing his passion for technology but took up snowboarding as a hobby with the family.Look out for how you are feeling at any given moment.  If beaten down, remember to look for the wave that will come to give you energy to do something new or something you once enjoyed. Don't try to ride every wave.  Awareness of going through the waves allows you to pick yourself up and come out of it.\n\n\n### Nick\n[[Cody de Arkland]] encourages us to Give yourself room to build up new confidence when starting a new career path / role, and let it be ok to not be confident for a time.  Build on what excites you and the places your confidence comes from.\n\n### John\n[[Josh Fidel]] says loving your job isn't enough to prevent burnout when other priorities slip.  In his case, it was too much time away from family because of travel 5 days a week combined with the immense pressure of working with large customers on things under close inspection by leadership.\n\n### Nick\nThings like exercise, being in nature, and a practice called [[Morning Pages]] helped me get away from the overwhelming feeling of such a large to-do list.  It was all this and not having social media logged in on my phone.\n\n### John\n[[Bill Kindle]], a Senior Systems Engineer at Chemstation, needed creative outlets like writing and participating in community groups to fight back burnout and boredom with his job.  The rev up and rev down of extra curriculars is different based on your situation (in contrast with Jonathan Frappier needing to trim down activities outside work).\n\n\n## Relatable Experience\n### John\nWe've seen a trend in guests who had some kind of background in education and then went into technology.  I'm part of that list as are [[Ethan Banks]], [[Jonathan Frappier]], and a couple of others.  [[Don Jones]] told us that teaching is just repackaging information.  Think about roles where that is needed.\n\n### Nick\n[[Dominique Top]], a Solution Engineer at HashiCorp, started off perfoming in a band and studied music at the Dutch Pop Academy.  She worked at an Apple store in retail sales and learned more about the devices and the tech.  She got a job as a recruiter for DevOps roles but would try to learn from the candidates about the technology, eventually attending and later leading community meetup groups in the space.  She got into DevOps community advocacy and then met a leader from HashiCorp who suggested she fill some skills gaps (which she did and later got a job as a Solution Engineer).\n\n### John\n[[Stephanie Wong]] went to school for communications and digital humanities (impact of tech on society and culture). She practiced her audio/video production skills in a guerilla podcast; When it came time to apply for a job for developer advocacy, she could apply all her tech skills from being a sales engineer with her communications background to get the job.   There is also a shout out to dreaming in bands concept here and saying no to Google Cloud (dream company).\n\n### Nick\n[[Jimmy Tassin]], a former IT admin and Solution Engineer at Lumen, said despite lacking industry-specific experience, he had experience in government-regulated industries, which was a positive when interviewing for a financial services industry job. During other times, he was able to draw the paralells between operating a successful Minecraft server and IT administration.\n\n### John\nSales experience doesn't always come from sales roles.  For example, selling projects to your boss (not just that we should upgrade to the next version because it's better).  [[Tony Reeves]], a Solution Engineer at VMware is a great example of this.\n\n[[Nick Korte]] said selling his ideas on solutions at a helpdesk was still selling.  \n\n[[David Klee]] went from doing IT for a performing arts center to working for a consulting firm to eventually starting his own consulting business.  The focus on helping solve interesting problems and his no nonsense / low pressure approach helps put customers at ease.\n\n\n# Don't Let the Journey End Here\n\n### Nick\nReach out to us with your ideas, your disagreements, the stories you'd like to share with us. Our DMs are open, we'd love for you to listen to any of the episodes that you find helpful and subscribe if you like our content in general.\n\n### John\ngraph.nerd-journey.com will be live by tomorrow. If we're missing conceptual links or some of our thought should connect to things that don't exist on our graph, let us know and we'll investigate and add it. Maybe you'd like to come on to talk about it, even? There's an idea.\n\nThat's all the content we have that we didn't cut. We'd love to open up for questions. \n\nOr if you don't have any questions, we'll just keep talking.\n\nNick has another session at 3:30, so he can't stay after, but I'm happy to hang out in the hallway, or head over to the VMware Communities and Code.","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.054589206Z","tags":null},"/Speaker-Notes-Condensed2":{"title":"Speaker Notes - Condensed2","content":"\n# Speaker Notes - Condensed2  \n\n## Becoming a Top Tier Individual Contributor\n\n### Intro\nWe saw these four patterns, and mapped them to four books on the topic.

She practiced her audio/video production skills in a guerilla podcast; When it came time to apply for a job for developer advocacy, she could apply all her tech skills from being a sales engineer with her communications background to get the job.   There is also a shout out to dreaming in bands concept here and saying no to Google Cloud (dream company).\n\n### Nick\n[[Jimmy Tassin]], a former IT admin and Solution Engineer at Lumen, said despite lacking industry-specific experience, he had experience in government-regulated industries, which was a positive when interviewing for a financial services industry job. During other times, he was able to draw the paralells between operating a successful Minecraft server and IT administration.\n\n### John\nSales experience doesn't always come from sales roles.  Give the example of selling projects to your boss (not just that we should upgrade to the next version because it's better).  [[Tony Reeves]], a Solution Engineer at VMware is a great example of this.\n\n[[Nick Korte]] said selling his ideas on solutions at a helpdesk was still selling.  \n\n[[David Klee]] went from doing IT for a performing arts center to working for a consulting firm to eventually starting his own consulting business.  The focus on helping solve interesting problems and his no nonsense / low pressure approach helps put customers at ease.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-18T21:59:37.054589206Z","tags":null},"/Speaker-Notes-People-Management-Career":{"title":"Speaker Notes - People Management Career","content":"\n\n# Speaker Notes - People Management Career\n\n## [[Managing People is a Different Skill Set Than Being an Individual Contributor]]\n\n[[Ethan Banks]] is co-founder of Packet Pushers Interactive; Host or co-hosts podcasts about IT for architects and engineers on shows such as [[Heavy Networking]] and [[Day Two Cloud]]. He thought getting into managment would be like a technical lead, but found out it was resource management and coordination meetings. It was a step removed from technology. It required a different skill set, almost unrelated to the individual contributor role, other than being able to conceptually understand what the ICs were doing. [[Episode 42]]\n\n[[Don Jones]] was a VP at Pluralsight when we talked to him, VP of Content at Karat, and mentioned that managers are dependent on their team for their success, not themselves. They're also removed from whether any particular day went well (and might not find out for weeks or months!). It's a different job with different skills. [[Episode 137]]\n\nWhen we originally talked to [[Charlie Nichol]], he was a Senior Manager of Solution Engineering at VMware. He's currently a Regional VP for Americas Channel Sales Engineering at Rubrik. He knew how to motivate top performers because he was one but lacked the ability to motivate those not performing well at first (i.e. not everyone is motivated by the same thing).  Managers take care of many things that happen, but we might not see that they did it (i.e. making sure someone gets paid for coming to work on their first day).   Charlie took the aspects of every good manager he had met and developed his own methodology.  Management is like parenting in that way (take all the good you see from others and create your own, cannot know what it is like until you do it).  You are no longer an expert on technology.   [[Episode 51]]\n\nWhen we talked to [[Brad Christian]], he was a Solution Engineering Manager in the Networking and Security Business Unit at VMware. He's currently a Product Marketing Manager at DataStax. He realized with a team you can widen the impact and scope of what you can accomplish, especially with a high performance team.  Brad learns from his team and considers himself a servant leader.  Management is also a path to more money.  Brad’s goal is to remove impediments from the team and help them do their job better. If you can do that and enjoy it and hold onto your technical skills a little, you can be successful.  [[Episode 114]]\n\n[[Jeff Eberhard]] was a Solution Engineering Leader at VMware when we spoke to him. He's currently a Cloud Sales and Engineering Leader at Oracle. He had to learn how to manage people significantly older than him.  \"How do I lead someone who has been doing this since before I was born?\" [[Episode 115]]\n\n## [[Management vs. Leadership]]\n[[Brad Pinkston]] is a Director of Partnerships at Decisionlink, though he was \na Director of Global Solutions Consulting at VMware when we spoke to him.says, \"You don't have to be a manager to be a leader.\" Leadership is inspiring, teaching, mentoring, coaching, and supporting your colleagues. Management adds the tasks of hiring, firing, performance management and excercise of role power to support the team. A leader might have power from networking and relatinoships, but not role power. A manager may have role power but lack a network and relationships.  [[Episode 58]]\n\n[[Don Jones]] also says that mangement and leadership are two separate things. You can lead as a peer, without being the boss. Managers handle resource allocation, measurement, etc. [[Episode 137]]\n\n[[Scott Lowe]] also re-states the point about leadership being different than management. Part of the leadership task is helping others be more effective in their roles without being their manager. [[Episode 152]]\n\n[[Dreaming in Bands]] It's probably worth mentioning our general career advice that kept popping up about dreaming in bands, or a spectrum of possibilities, instead of focusing on a single company or role. Going through a process of deconstructing the parts of the role and/or company that appeal to you is a really important step. There might be more roles or companies than you know of. [[Stephanie Wong]] is a great example of someone who wouldn't have been able to articulate her current Developer Advocacy role out of college, because it didn't exist yet. Maybe your dream role or dream company doesn't exist yet!\n\n\n## [[Characteristics of Good Managers]]\n[[Kelly Schroeder]] mentioned that a manager he replaced very clearly cared about the wellbeing of the team and it's memebers, both personally and professionally. That concept of caring for the people on your team is something that Kelly still carries with him. [[Episode 59]]\n\n[[Paul Green]] mentions that a key task a manager should do is to help reports think through how to solve a problem rather than solving it for them. Additionally, it's critical to connect how employee responsibilities help the company accomplish it's goals. [[Coaching vs. Directing]]  [[Episode 93]]\n\n[[Jeff Eberhard]] observations on a good manager: someone interested in personal connection with their reports, an interest in helping them develop their strong points as well as their weaknesses, and an understanding of the individual's abilities as a contributor are (a high flyer with the potential to move up, a solid contributor who wants to stay put, or someone struggling who needs support to improve to the team standard). \n\n[[Evan Oldford]] was encouraged to come work at a startup by a manager that liked him and originally took a chance on him at a company called Whistle.  Great managers remember great talent and want to bring you with them.  [[Episode 172]]\n\n## [[MOC - Communicating With Your Management#^6af8c8]] About Becoming A Manager\n\n- [[Episode 1]] Talk to your manager about your aspirations to become a manager\n- [[Episode 42]] [[Ethan Banks]] implies that you should actually listen to warnings your manager has about becoming a manager. They know more about what management in that organization is like than you do.\n- [[Episode 51]] [[Charlie Nichol]]'s manager encouraged him to look into leadership/management even though Charlie was a SE and saw himself as someone who should stay close to the technology. Trusting your manager's instincts.  In Charlie's case, his manager groomed him and allowed him to take on management type tasks.\n- [[Episode 83]] [[Brad Pinkston]] talked to his manager about his desire to become a manager and received support to actually get the position.\n- [[Episode 115]] [[Jeff Eberhard]] after 9 months as a VMware SE asked his boss to be considered to lead a new team that was forming and was told no (boss thought the team would take him seriously).  Jeff also got feedback from his peers that the move to leadership was a good idea, which he took back to his boss, went through a formal process, and was given the job.   Jeff says if you have someone on your team that wants to move into leadership, it makes your job as a leader easier.\n\n## [[Management Interviews]]\n- [[Brad Pinkston]] spoke to the parallel between preparing for a management interview and preparing to take a certification exam. There is value in trying and failing to see what the process is really testing for. There's value in a formal preparation, study, and peer group preparation process along with your manager's support and sponsorship. Making your intentions known to your managers means you'll have the opportunity for coaching and development of the skills one needs to succeed at the interview as well as the job. He sees a lot of value in having conversations with others who are in the management position and making a plan to get the management position. That plan could include things like building a brand, formal management training, and opportunities to showcase the skills one would need as a manager. Brad also sees value in doing mock interviews with people who have actually interviewed people for management positions. [[Episode 83]]\n- When [[Charlie Nichol]] knew ahead of time that a manager position was opening up. He got unofficial interviews with the stakeholders before the position even opened up to understand what their expectations from the manager position and to get their blessing to apply.

There are ways to lead without being a manager and ways to advance your career as an individual contributor that does not end in management. In fact, management may not even be an interest or something that is right for you.\n\n#### Key Takeaway 2\n\nThe pandemic has made life even more difficult for so many. What can you do to prevent burnout and preserve your mental health? We'll share stories of people who have been through it and what they did to dig themselves out of it.\n\n#### Key Takeaway 3\n\nWhat can you be doing to stand out in a hot job market?

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`.

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Create an Operand Account on [their website](https://operand.ai/).\n2. Go to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e Integrations.\n3. Follow the steps to setup the GitHub integration.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!
