In today&rsquo;s episode we share part 2 of our interview with Blake Johnson.  We discuss ways to get started with fitness and stay the course, dealing with accountability and shame, what we can learn from the life of a car salesman, and thoughts on finding your why.   </p><p>Original Recording Date:  07-08-2021 </p><p><a href=/Blake-Johnson rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Blake-Johnson>Blake Johnson</a> (find him on

They have just found a way to make it major part of their lives (a must have for them). </p></li><li><p>This makes the process more human.  People at the gym who look fit are struggling too, struggling to get better.  One day, you could be struggling with them. </p></li></ul><a href=#1455---accountability-and-shame><h2 id=1455---accountability-and-shame><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>14:55 - #Accountability and #Shame </h2></a><ul><li><p>Does staying the course mean you need to exercise daily? </p></li><li><p>Life happens.  Regardless of what happened in the past we are here right now.  Every client Blake works with has a goal (certain number of days per week, no one size fits all). </p></li><li><p>If goals don&rsquo;t get reached, don&rsquo;t beat yourself up.  Focus on the successes and not the misses. </p></li><li><p>Staying the course is answering the question &ldquo;why did we get off track?&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>Maybe you ate bad food and missed a workout.  Consider ways to change it next time so you will feel better.  </p></li><li><p>Staying the course is being honest with yourself and having accountability without the judgement.  There is a lot of judgement out there. </p></li><li><p>Either change the behavior, or change the fitness program accordingly.  There is no one size fits all.  We need to be able to adapt to reach goals in anything we do. </p></li><li><p>Nick mentions this sounds like an episode of
<a href=https://packetpushers.net/ rel=noopener>Packet Pushers</a> discussing blameless post mortems.  When someone asks you why you missed the mark, it comes with a fear of judgement. </p></li><li><p>At the end of the day, if you need to be held accountable that is important.  What if we were held accountable / held ourselves accountable without necessarily feeling shame? </p></li><li><p>Some people play the shame game.  Instead…acknowledge it, fix it, and move on.  </p></li><li><p>John mentioned people can be more comfortable in the shame spiral than in making a positive change. </p></li><li><p>Blake said he&rsquo;s read psychology studies about why people stay in bad situations (regardless of what it is).  </p></li><li><p>We overload the senses so much we end up staying where we are. </p></li><li><p>If Blake could change the world, he&rsquo;d want everyone to learn about psychology and philosophy to be more well rounded. </p></li></ul><a href=#2218---human-improvement><h2 id=2218---human-improvement><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>22:18 - Human Improvement </h2></a><ul><li><p>Life is short.  We only have one shot at this life.  Life is far too short to not maximize our abilities, to wake up feeling bad, to not give yourself ample opportunity to go out and have fun, or not love every second of it. </p></li><li><p>Blake needed to be different things growing up.  One day he decided he wanted to focus on his life being the life he wanted it to be. </p></li><li><p>He focused on treating people well.  They in term started treating him a lot better.  </p></li><li><p>Blake focused on surrounding himself with positive thinking and situations that made him feel better. </p></li><li><p>There is no reset button or cheat code.  We cannot surround ourselves with that kind of thinking. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s easy to look at someone else and say &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t I be like that.  They have so much.&rdquo;  That person probably feels the same way about something else. </p></li><li><p>Life is short.  Maximize it. </p></li></ul><a href=#2500---life-of-a-car-salesman><h2 id=2500---life-of-a-car-salesman><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>25:00 - Life of a Car Salesman </h2></a><ul><li><p>Nick mentioned it&rsquo;s one thing to love what you do but another to master your field and succeed.  Does the work involved ever become just work? </p></li><li><p>Blake says strength and conditioning at one point became a chore. </p></li><li><p>Blake owns his own business and can pour the parts he loves into it. </p></li><li><p>Life is too short to do what you hate.  But Blake doesn&rsquo;t want to surround himself with just his passions and gives the example of pursuing a PhD. </p></li><li><p>Strength and conditioning was his full career for 6+ years.  Add personal training before that, and it makes about a decade. </p></li><li><p>He&rsquo;s found his own style of training. </p></li><li><p>Blake has childish joy about being able to run his own business. </p></li><li><p>Blake is a car salesman today.  Does that surprise you we have not mentioned it to this point?  He&rsquo;s in the customer service game and just happens to sell cars. </p></li><li><p>He gets to meet and talk with incredible people who are passionate about other things. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s a bonus that Blake can keep reading the books he wants to read and can train the way he wants to train, doing what he loves. </p></li><li><p>Blake loves life, and he loves people. </p></li><li><p>Of all the things that you could sell, selling cars didn&rsquo;t seem to mesh (on the surface) with the positivity and self-actualization we&rsquo;ve discussed. </p></li><li><p>If you had told Blake 5 years ago or any time in his life that he would be selling cars, he would have laughed at you. </p></li><li><p>When he stepped away from strength and conditioning, he started applying for several jobs.  One of them was selling cars for the company he works for now. </p></li><li><p>Blake would not be in the car game if it was not for this company.  They have a reputation for customer service and taking care of both customers and employees. </p></li><li><p>Blake could tell during the interview process that the company wasn&rsquo;t fake. </p></li><li><p>He decided he could learn how to sell cars to work at this company. </p></li><li><p>Blake says car salesmen basically earn their reputations.  He&rsquo;s work with many of them and heard lots of stories from customers. </p></li><li><p>Blake can take what many people consider a loathsome experience and turn it into &ldquo;that was a positive experience.&rdquo;  He is enjoying the chance to change people&rsquo;s perception of what the experience should be. </p></li><li><p>If buying a car can be a decent experience, imagine how many other experiences we could re-engineer.  </p></li><li><p>The work has been both challenging and fun. </p></li><li><p>John highlights car sales as a 100% commission job in some cases, a system to grind down the customer, etc. </p></li><li><p>There can be companies who don&rsquo;t fit this mold and seek to break out in a positive way. </p></li><li><p>Blake&rsquo;s company (which is about to celebrate their 110th year) is going to give a fair price and negotiate if they can in addition to treating customers well. </p></li><li><p>We&rsquo;d rather have a repeat customer than a one time customer.  Take care of people the honest, right way, and the results speak for themselves. </p></li><li><p>Blake does birthday cards by the way! </p></li><li><p>John points out the disappearing asymmetry of information in the car buying process. </p></li><li><p>Blake says his company has used the golden rule of treatment to others much like the hospitality industry has adopted. </p></li><li><p>If Blake doesn&rsquo;t sell, he doesn&rsquo;t get paid.  The company treats him not like the new guy but like an associate no different than anyone.  The culture was refreshing. </p></li></ul><a href=#3717---finding-your-why-and-closing-thoughts><h2 id=3717---finding-your-why-and-closing-thoughts><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>37:17 -

<a href=https://www.manifestfit.com/ rel=noopener>Manifest Fit</a> or working for the company where he sells cars, Blake&rsquo;s why has always stayed the same - treat people well and leave a positive impact. </p></li><li><p>If you can&rsquo;t answer why you show up every day, think about it.  How can you figure it out and maybe navigate your life a bit differently? </p></li><li><p>A number of previous guests agreed that aligning personal values with their company&rsquo;s values was a reason for joining, regardless of role. </p></li><li><p>For where Blake and his wife are and what they value, it came down to where he felt more at home with an employer. That was the guiding light when he had to decide between two potential offers. </p></li><li><p>Parting thoughts </p></li><li><p>The best advice and the worse advice was the same. Do what you love.  This can be a big rabbit hole of frustration and may not turn into a career. </p></li><li><p>At the same time, if you do something you hate, it is not going to be beneficial.  Life is way too short to settle for less than YOUR best (not the best but your best).   </p></li><li><p>Create a 3-dimensional life for yourself. </p></li><li><p>Feel free to reach out to Blake on
