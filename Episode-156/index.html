<a href=https://joshduffney.gumroad.com/l/become-ansible rel=noopener>his first technical book</a>.Â </p></li><li><p>He has done a lot of work on productivity, <a href=/Digital-Minimalism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Digital-Minimalism>digital minimalism</a>, and wellbeing and wanted that to crystalize into a book.Â </p></li><li><p>Unfortunately Josh bit off more than he could chew at the beginning.Â </p></li><li><p>Josh has spent the last year trying to learn how to write the caliber of book he wants to write.Â  This required a lot of information, and Josh could not keep it all in his head.Â  He stumbled upon smart notes to help develop an external system that would help.Â </p></li><li><p>There are many schools of thought on productivity such as
<a href=https://gettingthingsdone.com/ rel=noopener>Getting Things Done</a> and others.Â </p></li><li><p>Josh heard about the smart notes system through repeated word of mouth.Â  He tends to be a late adopter, letting others filter out the noise.Â </p></li><li><p>A few years ago his manager mentioned Josh&rsquo;s interest in productivity and suggested he read the book
<a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes-Audiobook/B09HSSQMTW?source_code=GPAGBSH0508140001&ipRedirectOverride=true" rel=noopener>How to Take Smart Notes</a>.Â </p></li><li><p>This kept resurfacing on Twitter by others, eventually getting promoted by someone whose newsletter Josh followed. At that point Josh decided to give it a shot.Â </p></li><li><p>After reading the book, he felt it was exactly what he needed.Â </p></li><li><p>It gave Josh a way to reverse engineer the process of writing.Â </p></li><li><p>As a content developer, Josh writes all the time in his day job.Â </p></li><li><p>The fear of the blank page has always bothered Josh.Â  He has spent the last year learning how to write fast and how to de-compartmentalize phases of writing.Â </p></li><li><p>Right after reading comes note taking.Â  If you have a pile of notes and a way to go back and find them, you always have an idea to write about.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>This also allows a way to organize thoughts that were swirling in Josh&rsquo;s head and causing anxiety.Â </p></li><li><p>Once you read a certain scale, you need somewhere to externalize the knowledge to reference at a later time.Â  There is no way to keep so many mental models in your head.Â </p></li><li><p>The book <a href=/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes>How to Take Smart Notes</a> is really the American publisher&rsquo;s title.Â  It was originally titled
<a href=https://zettelkasten.de/ rel=noopener>Zettelkasten</a>, and the original translation of that is slip box (somewhat akin to a 1980s card catalog at a library).Â  Originally the system was a pile of cards with index numbers on them and ideas.Â  <a href=/Zettelkasten rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Zettelkasten>Zettelkasten</a></p></li><li><p>How to think and write more productively is kind of the point of the book.Â </p></li><li><p>True Zettelkasten practitioners will make the same distinction on smart notes.Â </p></li><li><p>Josh says it is easy to get hung up on smart notes and the permanent note.Â  It puts so much pressure on the permanent note, but really note taking should improve with iteration over time as you learn to take over time.Â </p></li><li><p>There&rsquo;s no specific format of a smart note.Â  It&rsquo;s more about using them to think better and organize your knowledge.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#1137---smart-notes-basics><h2 id=1137---smart-notes-basics><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>11:37 - Smart Notes BasicsÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>The basic notion is that there are several notes, each with a different purpose.Â </p></li><li><p>Fleeting notes - sort of like a journal or short / brief notes to capture an idea, task, or insightÂ </p></li><li><p>Josh keeps a notebook with him at all times and uses it for fleeting notes.Â </p></li><li><p>These are meant to be processed within a couple of days and might generate things like reminders.Â </p></li><li><p>Literature notes - taking notes while you read and turning reading from a passive activity into an active activity.Â </p></li><li><p>This was the one Josh was least familiar with.Â  The primary purpose of this kind of note is to get more familiar with and understand the literature itself.Â </p></li><li><p>The inventor of Zettelkasten would take notes on index cards as he read.Â  Think of it like a brief summary with a page number on the index card to go back and reference / take in depth notes later.Â </p></li><li><p>Check out
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095 rel=noopener>How to Read a Book</a>, which provides a framework for marking up books (underline, write in margins, etc.).Â </p></li><li><p><a href=https://ucc.vt.edu/academic_support/study_skills_information/sq3r_reading-study_system.html rel=noopener>SQ3R</a> is a another reading comprehension method referenced as is
<a href=https://www.etown.edu/offices/learning/SQ5R_Method.aspx rel=noopener>SQ5R</a>.Â  The number of Rs depends on how much review you do.Â </p></li><li><p>Josh uses literature notes heavily when reading technical books, most recently in his learning of the
<a href=https://go.dev/ rel=noopener>Go Programming Language</a>.Â </p></li><li><p>Permanent notes - notes you want to keep forever but malleable in the sense that you can rework themÂ </p></li><li><p>These are the types of notes that go into your Zettelkasten / slip box.Â  In
<a href=https://obsidian.md/ rel=noopener>Obsidian</a>, this would be called a vault (where your knowledge base is built).Â </p></li><li><p>There is an entire process around connecting the notes.Â </p></li><li><p>John found the goal of extracting knowledge as you ingest it and predigesting it into the knowledge base as extremely interesting.Â </p></li><li><p>You can see all the things of interest in one place and understand these are the things you should write about.Â </p></li><li><p>Josh says the promise is once you have built the knowledge base you can look into it for ideas and that the majority of the work will have been done for you as you get ready to write a blog post or book.Â </p></li><li><p>Listen to John&rsquo;s example of how putting a few permanent notes together to form a blog post might work.Â </p></li><li><p>Josh says you will find the truth that there is no writing.Â  There is only rewriting.Â  As you take the notes and bring into different texts they will need transitions, some will need more clarity, and you&rsquo;ll find you can move around.Â </p></li><li><p>Once you get the knowledge out of your head you can externalize and move it around in a way you just can&rsquo;t do when it&rsquo;s in your head.Â </p></li><li><p>Josh&rsquo;s preference - whatever medium you have consumed the information in should be the medium you use to make notes.Â  For example, if Josh read a physical book, he would use physical note cards to start and transfer to Obsidian later.Â </p></li><li><p>Usually this is reserved for difficult books (200-300 page books get marked up and translated to physical notes).Â </p></li><li><p>For going through a tutorial or a blog post, Josh would put literature notes directly into Obsidian as he went.Â  The literature note would then get converted later into a permanent note.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Listen to Josh&rsquo;s example about doing this for the knowledge base he is building for Go lang.Â </p></li><li><p>Do you copy things down word for word as you come across them (literature notes) or put into your own words?Â </p></li><li><p>It is advised if you want to understand the material better that you put it into your own words.Â </p></li><li><p>Josh uses quote blocks in Obsidian if he&rsquo;s taking something word for word.Â  But the note likely would include more than just the quote to further his understanding.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#2042---a-critical-eye-for-relevance><h2 id=2042---a-critical-eye-for-relevance><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>20:42 - A Critical Eye for RelevanceÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Relevance has been the number 1 skill sharpened from note taking.Â  Since we last spoke, Josh has taken 370 physical notesÂ  and over 400 digital notes.Â </p></li><li><p>He&rsquo;s getting a lot better in the process of what is relevant.Â  At first he was reluctant to rely on his brain for remembering anything.Â </p></li><li><p>Josh recently re-read
