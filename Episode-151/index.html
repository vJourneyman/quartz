<a href=https://community.spiceworks.com/ rel=noopener>Spiceworks community</a>Â existed until over 500,000 users had joined it.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ peopleÂ heÂ cameÂ across and interacted with in theÂ community wereÂ both knowledgeableÂ and helpful.Â  If somoeneÂ madeÂ a suggestion that didn&rsquo;t work, DuwayneÂ could go back and ask theÂ person again.Â </p></li><li><p>InterestinglyÂ enough, DuwayneÂ at oneÂ timeÂ followed John WhiteÂ in theÂ community for learning and sharing purposes.Â </p></li><li><p>DuwayneÂ was a
<a href=https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps/be-a-spiceleader rel=noopener>SpiceLeader</a> for theÂ 
<a href=https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps/houston rel=noopener>Houston area SpiceCorps</a>.Â  For moreÂ detail on what SpiceCorps is, check out
<a href=https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps rel=noopener>this page</a>.Â </p></li><li><p>As a result of this, DuwayneÂ met a number of vendors whoseÂ products could actually help him moveÂ projects at theÂ bank forward.Â </p></li><li><p>It was technology that madeÂ IT professionals&rsquo; jobsÂ easier.Â  DuwayneÂ loved sharing with other IT professionals who might not haveÂ had timeÂ to do theÂ necessary researchÂ </p></li><li><p>Most of theÂ timeÂ thereÂ was no need to createÂ something from scratch (i.e. a script,Â etc.).Â  DuwayneÂ could look at what others had doneÂ and makeÂ tweaks to suit hisÂ environment.Â Â </p></li><li><p>SpiceCorps was a user group that began from peopleÂ using theÂ Spiceworks product.Â  PeopleÂ would meet to shareÂ experiences and help new users get moreÂ out of theÂ application.Â Â Â </p></li></ul><p>*Â Eventually vendors began to sponsor parts of meetings, providing refreshments to attendees for a chanceÂ to plug their products.Â  Attendees liked theÂ fact that technical representatives from theÂ vendor would comeÂ out and answer questions on how theÂ technology could help them.Â </p><ul><li><p>As theÂ Spiceworks application was updated less frequently, SpiceLeaders likeÂ DuwayneÂ needed to focus moreÂ on bringing in vendors for sponsorship.Â </p></li><li><p>Nick has been theÂ co-leader of theÂ SpiceCorps of Dallas / Fort Worth and references someÂ of theÂ activities from
<a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/spicecorps/dallas-fort-worth/meetings?filter=past" rel=noopener>past meetings</a>Â </p></li><li><p>Taking 1-1.5 hours out of an IT professional&rsquo;s day / week is taking valuableÂ time.Â  Attending a meeting likeÂ a SpiceCorps is someoneÂ intentionally spending their own time.Â  TheÂ work is not going to go away and probably will haveÂ to beÂ madeÂ up by an attendeeÂ someÂ other time.Â  TheseÂ types of meetings haveÂ to beÂ fun, interesting, and worthwhileÂ to get peopleÂ to show up.Â </p></li><li><p>John always found theÂ community around theÂ Spiceworks application really interesting becauseÂ heÂ spent very littleÂ timeÂ using Spiceworks software.Â  It was theÂ discussion forums on networking, storage, compute, virtualization and others which served as a great way toÂ educateÂ peopleÂ looking to break into theÂ industry / learn on theÂ fly.Â </p></li><li><p>John got so much out of theÂ community but has not really had much timeÂ to beÂ a part of it over theÂ last few years.Â </p></li><li><p>Spiceworks originally helped DuwayneÂ a lot (theÂ softwareÂ that did inventory and help desk).Â </p></li><li><p>ThereÂ wereÂ a number of applications built up around theÂ Spiceworks community likeÂ 
<a href=https://www.pdq.com/ rel=noopener>PDQ</a>.Â  This company had tremendous growth becauseÂ of Spiceworks and was a far lessÂ expensiveÂ alternativeÂ than Microsoft tooling.Â </p></li><li><p>DuwayneÂ met theÂ founders of PDQ back when it was Admin Arsenal at
<a href=https://www.spiceworks.com/spiceworld/ rel=noopener>Spiceworld</a>, learned about theÂ capabilities, started with theÂ freeÂ version of PDQ, andÂ eventually needed to invest in theÂ paid version becauseÂ of regulations and theÂ need to keep applications up to date.Â  It filled a gap in theÂ Spiceworks application capabilities andÂ eventually becameÂ theÂ tool to useÂ for inventory with Spiceworks being used moreÂ for ticketing.Â </p></li><li><p>DuwayneÂ shares theÂ story of when heÂ began using Spiceworks as a replacement to a product that changed corporateÂ ownership and becameÂ moreÂ expensive.Â </p></li><li><p>From 2007 - 2015 theÂ Spiceworks application was a big deal, but at someÂ point along Spiceworks decided to beÂ a marketing company that put vendors in touch with IT pros.Â  TheÂ focus on theÂ app seemed to go down a bit, leaving theÂ community as theÂ biggest value.Â </p></li><li><p>DuwayneÂ mentions knowing Nick and John via theÂ community long beforeÂ weÂ all met in person.Â </p></li><li><p>BecauseÂ peopleÂ wereÂ friendly and willing to shareÂ it madeÂ theÂ community great.Â  It was good friendship and fellowship.Â  WhatÂ elseÂ can you ask of life?Â  If you haveÂ that, you haveÂ it all.Â </p></li><li><p>PeopleÂ who participateÂ in communities likeÂ this areÂ doing it on their own time.Â </p></li><li><p>WeÂ may not all haveÂ theÂ knowledgeÂ of someÂ folks weÂ comeÂ across in communities.Â  But if weÂ can ask a question of somoeneÂ who has been thereÂ and get back a helpful response, it saves timeÂ andÂ energy.Â </p></li><li><p>Picking people&rsquo;s brains isÂ extremely helpful, and it allows you to build connections and friendships.Â  PeopleÂ in Spiceworks pushed John to dream bigger and better himself.Â  You may not haveÂ this in your mind until someoeneÂ brings it up.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#1730---money-isnteverything><h2 id=1730---money-isnteverything><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>17:30 - Money Isn&rsquo;tÂ EverythingÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>When DuwayneÂ got theÂ network administrator job at Wallis Bank, it was 5 miles from his homeÂ without him needing to driveÂ to Houston.Â </p></li><li><p>DespiteÂ theÂ fact that DuwayneÂ likely could haveÂ received better pay by going to Houston heÂ liked theÂ flexibility of going to and coming homeÂ from work at a decent hour.Â  HeÂ also did not haveÂ to relocate.Â </p></li><li><p>DuwayneÂ was not a job hopper and has only had 3 jobs in his career.Â  Moving to largeÂ companies was not for him.Â </p></li><li><p>DuwayneÂ identified what was important to him and madeÂ theÂ decision based on that.Â  NotÂ everyoneÂ has theÂ presenceÂ of mind to do this.Â </p></li><li><p>You can learn itÂ early or learn it late, butÂ eventually you will want a placeÂ to call home, a placeÂ to relax and get away from thigs.Â  &ldquo;Always being at theÂ top is not always whereÂ you want to be.&rdquo;
