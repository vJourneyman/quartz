The process of building the content was greatly aided by practicing the Smart Notes process we&rsquo;ve been reading about. You can see our connected notes at
<a href=http://graph.nerd-journey.com rel=noopener>graph.nerd-journey.com</a> We &ldquo;sold-out&rdquo; the pre-registration with 130 registrants. We had 77% of those seats filled (instead of the 50% we expected), and got extremely positive feedback with 1/3 of the eligible attendees leaving feedback. That feedback included some constructive areas we could improve, so we&rsquo;re excited to refine the both the content and our process. We&rsquo;d really like to share that process here; Maybe it will help you write your next user-group or conference session better and faster than it would without that process!</p><a href=#origins><h2 id=origins><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Origins</h2></a><p>We originally submitted &mldr;</p><p>Our second chance came from &mldr;</p><a href=#process><h2 id=process><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Process</h2></a><p>We&rsquo;d long been discussing how to make our content more connected and discoverable. We knew we had the tools, we knew it would enhance the experience of our audience, and we hypothesized that it would make insights more discoverable. So we went for it.</p><a href=#moving-show-notes-into-obsidian><h3 id=moving-show-notes-into-obsidian><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Moving Show Notes Into Obsidian</h3></a><p><a class="internal-link broken">Obsidian</a> is a tool that <a class="internal-link broken">John White</a> had come across in his dive into the <a href=/Zettelkasten rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Zettelkasten>Zettelkasten</a> personal knowledge mangement system. We&rsquo;d be re-introduced to it by <a href=/Josh-Duffney rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Josh-Duffney>Josh Duffney</a> when he returned to discuss his book, <a href=/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes-in-Obsidian rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes-in-Obsidian>How to Take Smart Notes in Obsidian</a> in episodes <a href=/Episode-156 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Episode-156>Episode 156</a> and <a href=/Episode-157 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Episode-157>Episode 157</a>.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Nick Korte</a> had been writing the show notes almost since the beginning in <a class="internal-link broken">markdown</a>, the native Obsidian text format. That made it simple for John to copy/paste the show notes from OneNote into an Obsidian vault.</p><a href=#making-connections><h3 id=making-connections><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Making Connections</h3></a><p>There was some work getting guests properly tagged, along with show-to-show references.</p><p>We also had to create notes about the repeating patterns we saw, and pulled every significant reference from a guest into the overall pattern note, along with a summary of what they said.</p><a href=#writing-content><h3 id=writing-content><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Writing Content</h3></a><p>There was a refinement step where we made each note leaner in the people we quoted and the heart of what they said</p><p>There was an organizational step as we put the notes in the rough order we thought they made sense, then realized that some of the ideas were subpoints of other ideas. For example, &ldquo;participating in community&rdquo; was part of <a href=/MOC-Show-Your-Work-for-Job-Excellence rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/MOC-Show-Your-Work-for-Job-Excellence>MOC - Show Your Work for Job Excellence</a> which was a supporting action for the top-level point of <a href=/MOC-Becoming-a-Top-Level-Individual-Contributor rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/MOC-Becoming-a-Top-Level-Individual-Contributor>MOC - Becoming a Top Level Individual Contributor</a>.</p><p>The refinement process began what we thought of a writing the content for the session. We refined how we&rsquo;d tell the story, which points were main points, which points were supporting points, who to quote, and when to quote them.</p><a href=#improvements-for-next-time><h2 id=improvements-for-next-time><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Improvements for Next Time</h2></a><a href=#slides-and-quoting-style><h3 id=slides-and-quoting-style><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Slides and Quoting Style</h3></a><p>Early on we wanted to make sure that we were emphasizing the value of the collective experiences of our guests. That meant that we had to quote them. And <strong>that</strong> meant that we had to introduce them and give a brief bio. We made the decision to have that be something we spoke while we had the point we were making on the slide. In retrospect, it interrupted our speaking flow to constantly refer to the information. John even got mixed up who he was quoting at one point. It would be easier to have the guests and bios on slides as we speak about what they said.</p><a href=#slides-and-knowledge-graph><h3 id=slides-and-knowledge-graph><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Slides and Knowledge Graph</h3></a><p>We included the knowledge graph on our slides, a visual representation of all the notes, their connections, and where the particular point was in the graph on the slide. However, we didn&rsquo;t do a great job of explaining what that visual representation was before we did it, so the value of that effort suffered.</p><a href=#signposting-our-management-career-section><h3 id=signposting-our-management-career-section><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Signposting Our Management Career Section</h3></a><p>We broke our <a href=/MOC-People-Management-Career rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/MOC-People-Management-Career>MOC - People Management Career</a> section down to introspection (it&rsquo;s a compltely different job, characteristics of good managers), and actions (talk to your manager about your aspirations and study for the interviews like you&rsquo;d study for a certification exam). But we didn&rsquo;t do a good job of saying that up front.</p><a href=#smart-notes-can-help-you-with-content-creation><h2 id=smart-notes-can-help-you-with-content-creation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Smart Notes&rdquo; Can Help You With Content Creation</h2></a><p>We found using connected notes extremely useful in content creation. The process, however, is most useful when you&rsquo;re capturing written content early. When we read <a href=/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes>How to Take Smart Notes</a>, we were asked to imagine a process of writing content which would be much easier than creating from the blank page:
Ideas for content were easier, just look at the areas which were most connected. Content outlines were easier, because we could just drop note title links in a rough order, then re-organize the high-level flow of our topics in the way we wanted to tell the story.
We missed on the benefit of having already-refined blocks of content, as we weren&rsquo;t doing that until the session was approved. However, from this point forward, we&rsquo;ll be looking at continually refining the patterns and ideas we see from our guests, and sharing them with our subscribers.</p><a href=#related-to><h2 id=related-to><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Related To</h2></a><a href=#sourced-from><h2 id=sourced-from><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Sourced From</h2></a></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://graph.nerd-journey.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by John White and Nick Korte using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://graph.nerd-journey.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/NerdJourney>Twitter</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
