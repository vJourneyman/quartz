Being MadeÂ RedundantÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>LouiseÂ moved on from theÂ recruitment agency and got a job at a scaling tech startup in Cork as a full timeÂ content writer.Â  It was LouiseÂ and only a coupleÂ of other peopleÂ when sheÂ was hired (very new team).Â </p></li><li><p>Not long after joining, sheÂ got theÂ feeling theÂ startup was not for her.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ company was scaling massively, going from 40Â employees to about 70 in just a coupleÂ of months.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ and her team won an award for best marketing blog in Ireland in 2016.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ felt something was coming (a gut feeling).Â  ThereÂ was a new director from New York who was making sweeping changes.Â </p></li><li><p>On a particular morning in October, LouiseÂ noticed someÂ very senior peopleÂ would not look her in theÂ eye.Â  They must haveÂ known what was coming.Â </p></li><li><p>At about 3 PM thereÂ was a messageÂ from theÂ CEO to comeÂ to a specific room.Â </p></li><li><p>When they walked in, they wereÂ told theÂ company was outsourcing theÂ blog to a company in New York, and theÂ team was being madeÂ redundant (laid off / let go),Â effectiveÂ immediately.Â  They had about 20-30 minutes to pack up their desks and say goodbye.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ was partly relieved.Â  It felt likeÂ a get out of jail card.Â  SheÂ could start interviewing.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ understood that thereÂ was nothing sheÂ had doneÂ to messÂ Â </p></li></ul><p>up.Â  TheÂ jobs of her team wereÂ legitimately being outsourced to a company in New York.Â </p><ul><li><p>LouiseÂ and a colleagueÂ wereÂ still in shock at getting theÂ news.Â  But LouiseÂ realized her resumeÂ was only 8 months old (had been with theÂ startup that long).Â  SheÂ added theÂ blogging award and began interviewing.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ interview process after this was grueling.Â  It ground her down and burned her out.Â  SheÂ interviewed for 5 months, receiving only rejections.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ was scratching her head.Â  Job descriptions wereÂ not accurate.Â  SheÂ would seeÂ digital marketing manager as theÂ titleÂ but kept getting hammered about being anÂ expert in Facebook ad campaigns.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ started writing downÂ everything sheÂ remembered from interviews and kept it in a spreadsheet.Â  After a coupleÂ of months sheÂ read back over it and saw Facebook comeÂ up again and again.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ knew sheÂ was not going to beÂ ableÂ to changeÂ companies putting theÂ wrong titles on jobÂ postings.Â  SheÂ could control closing theÂ gap in skillset, however, and started freelancing.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ worked with a coupleÂ of clients and ran Facebook ads.Â  In herÂ earlier years, another team (consultant, outsourcer) had run theÂ Facebook stuff.Â  SheÂ had no directÂ experienceÂ similar to what weÂ discussed with new graduatesÂ earlier in theÂ interview.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ had to go back and takeÂ a few courses on Facebook ad campaigns and then get someÂ experience.Â  That&rsquo;s all it really was keeping her from getting peopleÂ to say yes to hiring her.Â </p></li><li><p>Around theÂ timeÂ LouiseÂ took on this task sheÂ got someÂ mentoring too from oneÂ of Ireland&rsquo;s leadingÂ experts inÂ eCommerce.Â  That personÂ encouraged her to put down that sheÂ was Ireland&rsquo;s leadingÂ expert in LinkedIn training.Â  Her mentorÂ encouraged her to go and own that spaceÂ (which LouiseÂ did).Â </p></li></ul><a href=#844---a-passion-for-thecandidate><h2 id=844---a-passion-for-thecandidate><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>8:44 - A Passion for theÂ CandidateÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>LouiseÂ is quiteÂ passionateÂ about theÂ candidateÂ experienceÂ in theÂ hiring process and will fight for theÂ candidate.Â  Likely this comes from her horribleÂ experienceÂ in interviewing during that 5 month period.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ wroteÂ a coupleÂ of blogs and shared theÂ terribleÂ experiences sheÂ had as an interviewee.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ started writing about talent personas and becameÂ passionateÂ aboutÂ employer branding.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ then started working with someÂ companies on theirÂ employer branding.Â </p></li><li><p>Then LouiseÂ saw theÂ job at VMware.Â  WhileÂ reading theÂ description, for theÂ first timeÂ sheÂ thought &ldquo;this is me.&rdquo;Â  It wanted a trainer, a copy writer, a words person, someoneÂ passionateÂ aboutÂ employeeÂ branding and theÂ candidateÂ experience, based in Ireland,Â etc.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ got theÂ job, and she&rsquo;s still with VMwareÂ over a year later.Â </p></li><li><p>John makes theÂ point that so many of theÂ companies LouiseÂ had interviewed with left out theÂ critical skill that ruled a candidateÂ in or out from theÂ job description.Â  ThoseÂ companies wereÂ being inefficient in bringing in theÂ wrong candidates.Â  HopefullyÂ employers can learn a lesson in writing better job descriptions by hearing theÂ contrast in Louise&rsquo;sÂ experiences in interviewing as we&rsquo;veÂ detailed in theÂ show.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ aggregation of Louise&rsquo;sÂ experiences areÂ what madeÂ her a great candidateÂ for a roleÂ in talent marketing.Â </p></li><li><p>InterestinglyÂ enough, theÂ startup that outsourced their marketing and madeÂ peopleÂ redundantÂ eventually switched back to insourcing talent from Cork.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ felt things changed this timeÂ around becauseÂ sheÂ had her own business.Â  TheÂ main reason for going back to work for anÂ employer was her mortgage.Â </p></li><li><p>Banks had given LouiseÂ feedback on needing to seeÂ consistent incomeÂ each month.Â  TheÂ only way sheÂ would hit that goal with her company would beÂ to go international and hireÂ a team of peopleÂ (which sheÂ did not want to do).Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ roleÂ at VMwareÂ was a contract position, which was attractiveÂ to LouiseÂ and allowed her to dip a toeÂ into theÂ water so to speak and get used to being anÂ employeeÂ again.Â </p></li><li><p>In addition to this being a new roleÂ within theÂ company, oneÂ of theÂ interviews had told LouiseÂ they wereÂ looking for a startup mindset (which fit herÂ entrepreneurial talents).Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ job description was written in theÂ new
<a href=https://blogs.vmware.com/careers/2021/09/go-hiring-innovating-vmwares-hiring-practices.html rel=noopener>Go Hiring</a> format whichÂ emphasizes performanceÂ over pedigree.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#1506---current-stateof-smartfox><h2 id=1506---current-stateof-smartfox><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>15:06 - Current StateÂ of SmartFoxÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>LouiseÂ has scaled this back to a mini sideÂ gig lately and will do theÂ occasional webinar in theÂ evenings.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ remains a well recognized speaker and also has partnerships with someÂ student groups (2 Women in STEM groups in Cork).Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ enjoys demystifying LinkedIn for students and getting them off to a good start.Â  SheÂ isÂ excited to seeÂ theÂ students grow and changeÂ roles over time.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ has her own onlineÂ school, which sheÂ perhaps does not promoteÂ as much as sheÂ should.Â  Check out theÂ

<a href=https://www.mtu.ie/ rel=noopener>Munster Technological University</a>.Â  STEM stands for Science, Technology,Â Engineering, and Mathematics.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ original request cameÂ from oneÂ of theÂ universities&rsquo; societies for women in STEM.Â  They had reached out to her after doing a GoogleÂ search looking for LinkedIn training.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ society was sponsored by a local pharmaceutical company and was ableÂ to pay LouiseÂ for theÂ work (her normal LinkedIn 50 minuteÂ bootcamp).Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ delivered theÂ training at a lectureÂ hall.Â  After her talk, theÂ society had invited theÂ photography society in to takeÂ professional headshots for them.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ has connected with a number of theseÂ ladies and had theÂ opportunity to seeÂ them progress.Â  SheÂ even ran into a group of them at a restaurant in Cork at oneÂ point after doing theÂ class.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ received such good feedback from theÂ group on her courseÂ that sheÂ now does this for themÂ every year.Â </p></li><li><p>As for theÂ second university sheÂ started working with, they had organized a oneÂ day prepareÂ yourself for an interview workshop with a number of sessions.Â  LouiseÂ was invited to comeÂ giveÂ her talk on LinkedIn for job seekers.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ showed theÂ group someÂ LinkedIn headlines.Â  SheÂ knew thereÂ wereÂ someÂ softwareÂ engineers in theÂ group and wanted to show them creativeÂ headlineÂ usage.Â  But it took her a whileÂ to findÂ examples of folks who had something moreÂ than just softwareÂ engineer.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ told theÂ group that theÂ headlineÂ was a way to market themselves,Â even if they put in a fewÂ extra words in addition to softwareÂ engineer it could really get theÂ attention of recruiters and talent acquisition folks.Â  PeopleÂ didn&rsquo;t know what words to useÂ to makeÂ themselves differentiated, so LouiseÂ helped them brainstorm ideas.Â  Now sheÂ encourages peopleÂ in her trainings to really think outsideÂ theÂ box with their headline.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ hopes to continueÂ theÂ work with theseÂ groupsÂ each year for as long as sheÂ can.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ headlineÂ is yourÂ elevator pitch (a lesson for all of us).Â  It influences hearts and minds and impacts peopleÂ whileÂ having a hugeÂ impact on searchÂ engineÂ optimization.Â </p></li><li><p>For job seekers, it&rsquo;s ideal to appear on pageÂ 1 when someoneÂ is searching.Â  This additional data in your headlineÂ influences both theÂ LinkedIn search bot and overall GoogleÂ search.Â </p></li><li><p>John has seen headlines whereÂ peopleÂ haveÂ written a sentenceÂ about themselves, but it doesn&rsquo;t really tell you anything.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ says thereÂ is a big differenceÂ between your headlineÂ (just below your picture) and your job titleÂ (further down theÂ page).Â  Think of theÂ headlineÂ likeÂ a newspaper headline.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ mentioned theÂ headlineÂ does haveÂ a character count. Instead of using theÂ word &ldquo;and&rdquo; sheÂ uses ampersand (&) instead as well as theÂ pipeÂ symbol (|) to divideÂ keywords.Â </p></li><li><p>Your headlineÂ and your job titleÂ areÂ two of theÂ most powerful searchÂ engineÂ elements.Â  LouiseÂ works with job seekers on theseÂ two items often as it can catch theÂ eyeÂ of recruiters and talent acquisition specialists.Â </p></li><li><p>Taking
<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/vjourneyman/ rel=noopener>John&rsquo;s LinkedIn page</a> as anÂ example, his headlineÂ (at theÂ timeÂ of this recording) is his titleÂ (CustomerÂ Engineer at Google).Â  MaybeÂ heÂ should changeÂ it to CustomerÂ Engineer | Pre-Sales TechnicalÂ Engineer at GoogleÂ Cloud | Co-host of Nerd Journey Podcast.Â </p></li><li><p>When LouiseÂ started SmartFox, sheÂ was a Director and added this to her job title.Â  SheÂ also added things likeÂ LinkedIn Trainer, LinkedIn Training Specialist, but was not highly ranked in search results.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ asked herself &ldquo;what do theÂ peopleÂ on pageÂ 1 of theÂ search results haveÂ that I don&rsquo;t have?&rdquo;Â  TheÂ peopleÂ at theÂ top of results had LinkedIn in their headline, job title, theÂ about section, basicallyÂ everywhere.Â  Adding Director wasn&rsquo;t theÂ greatest move.Â </p></li><li><p>Much likeÂ LouiseÂ had doneÂ with her websiteÂ previously, sheÂ totally revamped her LinkedIn page.Â  SheÂ was then coming up second in search results for LinkedIn Trainer.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ loves searchÂ engineÂ optimization becauseÂ it is soÂ easy to influenceÂ and manipulateÂ onceÂ you haveÂ your formula.Â  It&rsquo;s all about words, and LouiseÂ loves words.Â </p></li><li><p>By doing theÂ optimization, you areÂ putting yourself in theÂ top 1 percent becauseÂ many others areÂ not putting forth theÂ effort.Â </p></li><li><p>You probably need to haveÂ moreÂ quality work that you link to on your LinkedIn pageÂ (i.e. blogÂ posts you&rsquo;veÂ written) orÂ evidenceÂ that a big siteÂ referenced your article.Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s oneÂ thing to rank highly as a LinkedIn trainer, but in a different spaceÂ (global airlines, largeÂ industries that haveÂ searchÂ engineÂ optimization specialists) it may beÂ extremely difficult to get to theÂ top of theÂ search results.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>MaybeÂ weÂ need to get someoneÂ who is highly technical and works specifically on searchÂ engineÂ optimization on theÂ show?Â  Tweet at us and let us know what you think!Â </p></li></ul><a

TipsÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>We&rsquo;reÂ trying to reach peopleÂ who want to upskill and progress in their career.Â  Writing, quality content, understanding what peopleÂ areÂ looking for, understanding theÂ ruleÂ in skill being asked for in a job domain and getting training for it, and seeing theÂ results.Â </p></li><li><p>For theÂ job seeker / job changer, LouiseÂ learned about theÂ power of her network.Â  Don&rsquo;t underestimateÂ theÂ power of yours!Â </p></li><li><p>In Cork, certain job referrals and recommendations comeÂ through your professional network.Â </p></li><li><p>When sheÂ was madeÂ redundant sheÂ did not know any other marketers in theÂ area dueÂ to being so focused insideÂ herÂ employer.Â </p></li><li><p>At theÂ timeÂ sheÂ joined a women in business networking group.Â  It was her first timeÂ networking, and sheÂ was very nervous.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ went to weeklyÂ events with theÂ group and met theÂ graphic designer thatÂ eventually designed theÂ logo for SmartFox.Â  LouiseÂ had no money, so they bartered.Â Â Each would spend an hour helping theÂ other (LouiseÂ helping in digital marketing and Paula, theÂ graphic designer, helping with design).Â  As LouiseÂ got moreÂ business, peopleÂ really loved her branding, and sheÂ was ableÂ to bring business to Paula as well.Â  They paired up on a number of projects.Â </p></li><li><p>How do you network in a remoteÂ world?Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ suggests attending LinkedIn LiveÂ events, asking questions, and maybeÂ connecting with theÂ speaker or theÂ organizer afterward.Â </p></li><li><p>If you haveÂ an interview, you canÂ easily look them up on LinkedIn and possibly connect with them.Â </p></li><li><p>Find whereÂ your tribeÂ hangs out, and go thereÂ (networking groups for IT, forÂ engineers,Â etc.).Â </p></li><li><p>If you go to a physicalÂ event, don&rsquo;t stand in theÂ corner with your cup of tea or coffee.Â  PeopleÂ areÂ thereÂ to talk andÂ engage.Â </p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t forget someÂ business cards to hand out at physicalÂ events, and connect with peopleÂ on LinkedIn.Â </p></li><li><p>LinkedIn will get you found in searches.Â  Recruiters will reach out to you on LinkedIn.Â  Think of that likeÂ theÂ top of theÂ funnel.Â </p></li><li><p>Next in theÂ process is your cv / resume, and then thereÂ is theÂ interview.Â </p></li><li><p>In Louise&rsquo;s cases sheÂ was not great at interviewing.Â  When sheÂ thought about going back to anÂ employer, sheÂ had PTSD from her previousÂ experiences.Â  SheÂ ended up reaching out to her network and working with a good interviewer / coach for a coupleÂ of sessions (invaluableÂ learnings from this).Â </p></li><li><p>When it cameÂ timeÂ to interview, LouiseÂ interviewed at 3 companies.Â </p></li><li><p>At theÂ first company, sheÂ madeÂ it to theÂ final 2 out of 100 applications but did not get theÂ job.Â  SheÂ got someÂ valuableÂ feedback from them.Â  TheÂ candidateÂ they choseÂ had worked for theÂ company previously and could hit theÂ ground running (really theÂ only reason LouiseÂ was not selected).Â </p></li><li><p>At theÂ second company, thereÂ wereÂ about 150 applicants again.Â  LouiseÂ madeÂ it to theÂ last two.Â  After theÂ first interview sheÂ knew sheÂ did not want theÂ job and knew additional interviews would beÂ tough.Â  BecauseÂ they wereÂ going to beÂ tough, sheÂ knew sheÂ needed to do theÂ interviews anyway.Â  SheÂ was very brazen and bold during theÂ last few interviews, and theÂ company liked that, offering her theÂ job (which sheÂ declined, knowing sheÂ had a fallback with SmartFox).Â </p></li><li><p>At theÂ timeÂ sheÂ was offered theÂ job for company # 2, sheÂ was in her second interview with VMwareÂ and really felt that was theÂ oneÂ for her.Â  In her third and fourth interviews with VMwareÂ sheÂ told them openly that sheÂ wanted theÂ job and felt theÂ spec was written for her.Â </p></li><li><p>BecauseÂ LouiseÂ had worked for herself, learned to sell, and cameÂ up with ideas it helped her stand out.Â  SheÂ had confidenceÂ to say things likeÂ &ldquo;this is what I can do for you.&rdquo;Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s really tough when you go in for an interview.Â  Sometimes if you&rsquo;reÂ getting ground down from being told no, try to find an interview coach (if you can).Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Work your network.Â </p></li><li><p>OptimizeÂ your profile.Â </p></li><li><p>ThereÂ areÂ so many things you can do that will add up to a greater shift in your luck.Â </p></li><li><p>If you need to do someÂ freelancing or takeÂ a lower paying job to get out of grinding mode, that&rsquo;s fineÂ too.Â </p></li><li><p>If thereÂ is something you can do to show anÂ employer how passionateÂ you areÂ about a subject (blog, podcast, or other), it will makeÂ you stand out.Â Â </p></li><li><p>if you&rsquo;reÂ going to blog, you don&rsquo;t need to publish weekly.Â  MakeÂ a portfolio site.Â  You need something that gives you that touch of gold dust and sparkle.Â Â </p></li><li><p>WeÂ look forward to finding someÂ interesting topics to collaborateÂ on with LouiseÂ in theÂ future!Â Â </p></li></ul><h2 id=contact-ushttpstwittercomnerdjourney-if-you-need-help-on-thejourney><a href=https://twitter.com/NerdJourney rel=noopener>Contact us</a> if you need
