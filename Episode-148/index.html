In today&rsquo;s episode we share part 1 of our interview with Chris Wahl and discuss Chris&rsquo;s early experience demonstrating proof of work, advanced certifications, and experience at a startup.Â Â </p><p>Original Recording Date: 9-23-2021Â </p><p>Topics â€“ #ProofOfWork, #Blogging, Encouraged to Move On, Over the Mountain of #VCDX, Into #OpenSource, #Startup Magic and Being a #BuilderÂ #Slalom</p><p>===========================Â </p><a href=#322---proof-of-work><h2 id=322---proof-of-work><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3:22 - Proof of WorkÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/wahlchris/ rel=noopener>Chris Wahl</a> is a Senior #Principal at
<a href=https://www.slalom.com/ rel=noopener>Slalom</a>.Â  He leads a team of consulting technologists who solve complex problems related to public cloud, #DevOps and many other items under the technology umbrella.Â </p></li><li><p>Technology was never a mystery for Chris.Â  His dad had a computer when he was a kid, and Chris wanted to take it apart and play with video games.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Chris found odd jobs working at the library writing code and even led a computer user group in college (think LAN parties).Â </p></li><li><p>After graduating from Devry, he put together a binder with all of his work (building / fixing computers) to impress interviewers.Â  After sharing the binder with someone from General Motors, they hired him.Â </p></li><li><p>Always think about what someone else might not be doing that you can showcase.Â  Maybe it&rsquo;s certifications or something else.Â </p></li><li><p>Chris didn&rsquo;t want an easy first place.Â  He wanted to crush it (and he did).Â </p></li><li><p>The binder had some design work and the planning he had done as part of the computer users group.Â </p></li><li><p>There is nothing wrong with having a body of work to show your experience and capabilities.Â </p></li><li><p>John mentions publicizing the types of projects you work on is a great way to share proof of work.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#713---blogging><h2 id=713---blogging><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>7:13 - BloggingÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Chris started blogging in about 2008.Â  In 2008 he was working in an IT role (Sysadmin / Help Desk) and new he needed to elevate himself.Â  He was reading other people&rsquo;s articles.Â </p></li><li><p>After realizing he was solving a lot of problems, why not write about it?Â </p></li><li><p>Chris wanted to contribute back to the communities that had helped him but also wanted a way to remember some of the unique things he had done (which he wasn&rsquo;t otherwise going to be able to remember as well).Â </p></li><li><p>Was blogging an extension of the binder?Â </p></li><li><p>Writing is the best skill you can hone as a technologist.Â  It is often cited as the largest gap.Â  The only way to get better at it is to write at it.Â </p></li><li><p>If you leverage writing for a second brain, a time machine, or a place to showcase your work you are developing the skill of writing well (which can catapult you into new heights in your career) and getting many other benefits as a result.Â </p></li><li><p>If you&rsquo;re afraid someone will be critical of your work, it&rsquo;s optional to receive the feedback.Â  You can turn that stuff off.Â </p></li><li><p>If you are creating it for the reasons Chris mentioned, you can leverage some trusted peers for feedback.Â  The anonymous internet is not nice, so you should not expect it to be.Â </p></li><li><p>John has heard the term second brain before.Â </p></li><li><p>Chris&rsquo;s approach to what he hears / learns is to write it down.Â  He uses
<a href=https://keep.google.com rel=noopener>Google Keep</a> with color coding and a labeling system.Â </p></li><li><p>He needs a clean working palette to be creative.Â  If there is a technical crust, it doesn&rsquo;t work.Â  He needs a searchable repository.Â </p></li><li><p>The bits that erupt into a blog are usually more finite in nature and less part of the metadata kept in his &ldquo;second brain.&rdquo;Â </p></li><li><p>John has recently started reading about personal knowledge management, specifically
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten rel=noopener>Zettlekasten</a>.Â * The system Chris described seemed to be a continuation of the binder.Â  <a href=/Zettelkasten rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Zettelkasten>Zettelkasten</a></p></li><li><p>There is an iterative process to writing.Â  What you start with is never what you finish with.Â  There are some layers of self-exploration involved.Â </p></li><li><p>Writing makes you think about how you&rsquo;re going to display the information.Â  You&rsquo;re not just coming up with it in real time but creating a flow with a start, middle, and end.Â  Many times you walk into the middle of a problem, so writing things down in a structured way gives you another perspective on the solution.Â </p></li><li><p>John says you&rsquo;re writing for a future version of you without the contexts you have right now.Â </p></li><li><p>Chris likes non-opinionated systems for knowledge management (a blank slate that allows you to define the flow) without a lot of structure required.Â  Chris wants to be able to get in and start taking notes.Â </p></li><li><p>This is part of the reason he chose Google Keep.Â  The tags and labels made sense because this is how Chris would manage his cloud accounts / infrastructure.Â </p></li><li><p>Take a well defined process that works for technical documentation, automating that to work in the cloud world, and applying to a knowledge repository.Â  There will be a number of great patterns that work.Â </p></li><li><p>Any time Chris has a conversation and wants to pick out something important (idea, solution, concern).Â  If he&rsquo;s taking longer bits of notes, it will probably go into a Confluence page or something that is meant more for a project.Â </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Pretty much everything goes in there.Â  I won&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s valuable or not until later.&rdquo; - Chris WahlÂ </p></li></ul><a href=#1620---encouraged-to-move-on><h2 id=1620---encouraged-to-move-on><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>16:20 - Encouraged to Move OnÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>The job at the dealership was Chris&rsquo;s first real technology job and involved taking care of 3 dealers.Â  His predecessor had left him a screwdriver, a car magazine, and the domain admin password (and spelled the domain wrong).Â </p></li><li><p>Everything was kind of greenfield, allowing Chris to design the IT stack for each location.Â  For several years it was building PCs, working with technicians, and getting to understand the business (financial systems, business process flows, and how to integrate them into the IT stack).Â </p></li><li><p>Chris still has good relationships with his former colleagues (including is former boss) today.Â </p></li><li><p>His investment was to learn the business and figure out how the tech could make it better.Â </p></li><li><p>Chris loved it there and was told by his boss he needed to find something new (was capped out on raises).Â </p></li><li><p>There is a lot of experience that goes into building something from the ground up.Â </p></li><li><p>Looking back, this forced Chris to be scrappy, come up with solutions, and be a part of the greater community.Â </p></li><li><p>Chris&rsquo;s manager at this employer was not the norm.Â  Not every manager would encourage an employee to leave the company to better themselves.Â </p></li><li><p>Chris feels he lucked out on this one.Â </p></li><li><p>They had an honest relationship.Â  Chris expressed that he wanted more challenge and to work on more interesting things.Â </p></li><li><p>Chris and his manager struck a deal where Chris hired his replacement and stayed 2-3 months to train the new hire and find a job.Â  At first Chris would show how the systems worked and then allow the person to drive and ask Chris for help when needed.Â </p></li><li><p>The open relationship between employee and manager is something Chris has tried to apply for the people who work for him now.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>If we can&rsquo;t help you here, let&rsquo;s find you something great elsewhere.Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s hard to explain an entire enterprise in 2 weeks.Â </p></li><li><p>Chris encourages us all to leave it better than we found it, and he feels he did that at the dealership, leaving good documentation and honing his writing skills in the process.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#2224---over-the-mountain-of-vcdx><h2 id=2224---over-the-mountain-of-vcdx><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>22:24 - Over the Mountain of VCDXÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Chris worked a college education company, a medical company, and didn&rsquo;t really know you could work for a vendor.Â  You worked for companies and did tech stuff.Â </p></li><li><p>In 2011 he went into consulting, realizing there was no job where he would not get bored / restless or automate himself out of a job.Â  Consulting seemed to solve this.Â </p></li><li><p>Chris has never worked in a sales role by choice.Â  He respects people that do, but it is not for him.Â </p></li><li><p>Chris was the wrench turner, installing things like Horizon View, VXBlocks, etc. for customers.Â </p></li><li><p>He felt the designs he was being given to go implement could be better.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>For the first time Chris thought maybe he could be the one solving the problem and building the architecture instead of the one installing the things.Â </p></li><li><p>This put him on a journey to go get the
