<a href=https://community.spiceworks.com/meeting/show/2758 rel=noopener>Dallas / Fort Worth SpiceCorps meeting</a> in 2018 on digital forensics and penetration testing.Â <a class="internal-link broken">Digital Forensics</a> #Spiceworks</p></li><li><p>How Donovan got into the industry, the real storyÂ </p></li><li><p>He hated school but could fix computers.Â </p></li><li><p>How moving to Oklahoma City worked outÂ </p></li><li><p>Donovan mowed lawns for a while and would use the money to buy computer parts.Â </p></li><li><p>He started working for a corporation at age 18 and did not have a degree until much later.Â </p></li><li><p>People have at times called him a gunslinger.Â </p></li><li><p>The job at an insurance firm allowed him to do a lot of tinkering, but he didn&rsquo;t get along with his boss and was fired.Â </p></li><li><p>Teaching and not making people feel stupidÂ </p></li><li><p>At his next job, Donovan progressed to a leadership position after coming in with no certifications (only experience).Â  If people wanted to learn, he would teach them.Â </p></li><li><p>He wanted other people to know he loved the work.Â </p></li><li><p>Others in his past had made him feel stupid, and Donovan did not want anyone else to feel that way.Â </p></li><li><p>Getting fired, contract work, and catching full time workÂ </p></li><li><p>Donovan got interviewed by many companies, including Chesapeake Energy and decided to work for a contract company.Â </p></li><li><p>Contracts were often sat on site and expected to &ldquo;do work,&rdquo; performing whatever task needed handling at the time.Â </p></li><li><p>Donovan did work for energy companies, a bank, a manufacturing company, and others.Â </p></li><li><p>The things he learned in this role were out of necessity and to keep getting work.Â </p></li><li><p>He was later hired by an oil field company to learn everything and move everyone out.Â </p></li><li><p>The company later changed their minds about moving others out and gave Donovan a full-time job instead of a contract position.Â </p></li></ul><ul><li>Donovan was given every opportunity and never turned anything down, learning a ton in the process.Â </li></ul><ul><li><p>First forensic caseÂ </p></li><li><p>This was around 2004, and Donovan&rsquo;s boss asked him to investigate possible misconduct of field workers, working with the global head of HR as part of the assignment.Â </p></li></ul><p>*Â Â </p><a href=#1726---the-focus-on-forensics><h2 id=1726---the-focus-on-forensics><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>17:26 - The Focus on ForensicsÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p><a href=https://www.forensicfocus.com/ rel=noopener>Forensic Focus forums early member</a>Â </p></li><li><p>Donovan had never heard of forensics before the above assignment.Â </p></li><li><p>He mentioned having knowledge of McAfeeÂ ePO.Â </p></li><li><p>At smaller companies, the Systems Administrator ends up being the one to dive into any kind of forensics projects out of necessity.Â </p></li><li><p>Some of the pitfallsÂ </p></li><li><p>Donovan has worked about 2500 forensics cases at this point.Â  An attorney probably works around 25-30 cases per year.Â </p></li><li><p>There are a number of gotchas and ways to get yourself into trouble if processes are not followed or things are done incorrectly in a case such as being held personally liable.Â </p></li><li><p>Many times Donovan and his team have to testify in court.Â  The longest amount of time Donovan has spent on the stand testifying was 12 hours.Â </p></li><li><p>Flashing back to this first forensics investigation, Donovan had to document the chain of custody for the hard drive, did a forensic image, and then did an investigation. After that, he did not really know what to do.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Unknowingly Donovan protected himself from getting into trouble in his thoroughness of taking multiple copies of the hard drive (tips he received from the Forensics Focus forums).Â </p></li><li><p>Being given more security work under the app/network security flagÂ </p></li><li><p>Donovan&rsquo;s boss started to send all kinds of projects his way, including one for managing a Blackberry Enterprise Server.Â </p></li><li><p>The security focused work wasn&rsquo;t called security so much at that time.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Physical port securityÂ </p></li><li><p>Donovan learned to turn off physical network ports in offices to present people from plugging in their personal computer at work.Â </p></li><li><p>He was doing security stuff and didn&rsquo;t realize it.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#2716---not-quite-calling-it-security-yet><h2 id=2716---not-quite-calling-it-security-yet><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>27:16 - Not Quite Calling It Security YetÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Donovan started getting into servers and networking as well as Active Directory.Â </p></li><li><p>It started as a joke, kind of a look what I can do with these tools.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Listen to Donovan describe exposure to early trojans like
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub7 rel=noopener>Sub7</a> that was transmitted via e-mail.Â </p></li><li><p>AD based pranking and the connection to hackingÂ </p></li><li><p>Donovan shares the story of a prank he pulled on his teammates, which wasn&rsquo;t so different from what hackers did to Sony.Â </p></li><li><p>Other forums Donovan used and forum credibilityÂ </p></li><li><p>There were some security news groups Donovan was a part of in addition to Forensics Focus.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>A hackers elite forum was also a great place to get help.Â  Participation was a chance to gain credibility in what was (at the time) kind of a niche area.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#3140---transitioning-to-information-security-manager><h2 id=3140---transitioning-to-information-security-manager><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>31:40 - Transitioning to Information Security ManagerÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Conversation with the manager which led to applying at an energy companyÂ </p></li><li><p>Donovan called his manager&rsquo;s bluff on being encouraged to apply for the job if he wanted more money.Â </p></li><li><p>He started in at the company as a contractor but moved into aÂ  forensic analyst position without a degree.Â </p></li><li><p>The company couldn&rsquo;t find anyone with experience in this area until Donovan applied.Â  They relaxed the degree requirement for him.Â </p></li><li><p>There was no special security clearance required.Â  He worked with security teams to determine how to hunt down malware as well as on forensics investigations.Â </p></li><li><p>There was a lot of great talent at the company during this time.Â </p></li><li><p>Donovan outgrew the role eventually and set up forensic and security labs elsewhere.Â </p></li><li><p>Donovan has a great story about meeting and stopping
