<a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/livery-stable rel=noopener>livery</a>.Â </p></li><li><p>Parents started buying their kids ponies, and theÂ owner had to build 8 new stables to houseÂ all of this.Â </p></li><li><p>This was theÂ first timeÂ LouiseÂ was ableÂ to seeÂ somethingÂ end-to-end (GoogleÂ search to becoming a customer and seeing theÂ results of business growth).Â  SheÂ created a frequently asked questions (FAQ) pageÂ for theÂ website.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ realized just how powerful marketing could be.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#918---interviews-negotiation-and-initiative><h2 id=918---interviews-negotiation-and-initiative><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>9:18 - Interviews, Negotiation, and InitiativeÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Upon finishing theÂ course, sheÂ saw a job for an onlineÂ marketingÂ executiveÂ with a global recruitment agency based in Cork.Â </p></li><li><p>Interviewers told her after getting theÂ job that what they really liked was theÂ bartering with theÂ horseÂ stables and being ableÂ to show how sheÂ contributed to that business making money, generating leads, and getting customers.Â </p></li><li><p>No oneÂ told LouiseÂ to do it, but sheÂ had tracked metrics that showed progress of her work, starting with anÂ Excel fileÂ that showed whereÂ things began.Â  WebsiteÂ visits and inquiries coming in from theÂ websiteÂ wereÂ quiteÂ low.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ kept track of theÂ changes to theseÂ metrics over periods of 3, 6, 9 months and was surprised to seeÂ theÂ growth.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ had asked theÂ owner of theÂ stableÂ if sheÂ could list theÂ works sheÂ did for him on her resumeÂ as a job, and heÂ said absolutely.Â  HeÂ also acted as a referenceÂ for her.Â </p></li><li><p>When LouiseÂ brought up thisÂ experienceÂ in interviews, theÂ interviewers found it very interesting.Â  They understood LouiseÂ could negotiateÂ with others and had a great deal of initiative.Â </p></li><li><p>Any timeÂ LouiseÂ brought this up in futureÂ interviews in theÂ next several years, negotiation and initiativeÂ wereÂ referenced by interviewers as skills sheÂ had proven, and it was a total gameÂ changer for her.Â </p></li><li><p>If you&rsquo;veÂ doneÂ something you areÂ really passionateÂ about, put it on your resumeÂ (i.e. turn it into a job), and seeÂ what you can get back out of it (especially if you can add metrics to show impact likeÂ year over year customer growth,Â etc.).Â </p></li><li><p>This is also a lesson in documenting your work.Â  Not only did LouiseÂ do theÂ work, sheÂ documented theÂ work and its progress / impact.Â  This has potential to hit an interviewer out of nowhereÂ with completeÂ surpriseÂ (in a good way).Â </p></li><li><p>In digital marketing, you need to know how to useÂ a number of tools.Â  It&rsquo;s oneÂ thing to know how to useÂ theÂ tools but another to useÂ them properly to generateÂ revenue, forÂ example.Â  It serves as proof of work.Â </p></li><li><p>ContinuedÂ education in fields whereÂ weÂ useÂ technology combined with proof of work is key toÂ everyone&rsquo;s continued upward career trajectoryÂ </p></li><li><p>In conducting LinkedIn training LouiseÂ has worked with someÂ job seekers that might not haveÂ a degree.Â  ButÂ even with a degree, LouiseÂ still has to train on theÂ tools sheÂ uses to learn about new features and sharpen skills.Â </p></li><li><p>You will never know it all.Â  Things develop and moveÂ quickly.Â Â </p></li></ul><a href=#1557---training-and-gainingexperience><h2 id=1557---training-and-gainingexperience><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>15:57 - Training and GainingÂ ExperienceÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Part of theÂ work LouiseÂ does at VMwareÂ is training andÂ enablement.Â  It&rsquo;s vitally important for recruiters and sourcers to beÂ stay up to dateÂ on tools.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>When thereÂ is a new feature, her team has set a target that her team would beÂ trained within 3 weeks. TheseÂ folks will then train theÂ sourcers and recruiters on theÂ new features.Â </p></li><li><p>It seems likeÂ coursework, proof of work, andÂ experienceÂ will trump a degreeÂ with noÂ experience.Â  For so many jobs thereÂ is not a clean degreeÂ for it.Â </p></li><li><p>Perhaps theÂ foundations areÂ shaking in this area.Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s kind of a catch 22.Â  You haveÂ a degree, but for a graduateÂ it is trying to get anÂ employer to giveÂ you a chance.Â </p></li><li><p>Getting that hands on workÂ experienceÂ is a big win and differenceÂ maker.Â  But trying to crack that ceiling can beÂ very frustrating.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ knows that pain.Â  ThereÂ is nothing stopping you from freelancing or from reaching out and suggesting someoneÂ takeÂ you on as a contractor for a few weeks or someÂ other length of time.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>If it doesn&rsquo;t work out you remain friends and walk away.Â  It&rsquo;s a very lucrativeÂ option for anyÂ employer.Â </p></li><li><p>This reminds Nick of theÂ managers we&rsquo;veÂ had on theÂ show whoÂ exposeÂ someÂ of theÂ manager responsibilities to direct reports, allowing theÂ person to gain someÂ experience.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#2023---recruitment-marketing-developers-and-scrum><h2 id=2023---recruitment-marketing-developers-and-scrum><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>20:23 - Recruitment Marketing, Developers, and ScrumÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Getting theÂ job with theÂ recruitment agency was Louise&rsquo;s foray into recruitment marketing.Â  SheÂ started as an onlineÂ marketingÂ executiveÂ andÂ even covered for her manager that went on maternity leaveÂ (7 months).Â </p></li><li><p>At this point LouiseÂ was promoted to onlineÂ marketing specialist.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ got to seeÂ theÂ full scopeÂ of onlineÂ recruitment marketing, working with multipleÂ tools that needed to integrateÂ together likeÂ job boards.Â </p></li><li><p>This covered things likeÂ how jobs areÂ posted, how resumes get handled when they areÂ submitted, how theÂ resumes get put into theÂ databaseÂ / how they get to theÂ recruiter&rsquo;s inbox, managing communications, how to track candidates that got theÂ job they applied for,Â etc.Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ had to learn how to talk to developers, acting as a go between from business leaders likeÂ theÂ CEO of a branch down to them.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ learned to ask questions about theÂ business need for something and theÂ metrics theÂ company would useÂ to track it (which often times madeÂ theÂ idea of implementing something a competitor had just becauseÂ someoneÂ thought they should do it fall apart).Â </p></li><li><p>Things likeÂ timeÂ and workload management and general businessÂ etiquetteÂ wereÂ quiteÂ new to LouiseÂ at this time.Â </p></li><li><p>Louise&rsquo;s brother advised her to bring a prop to meetings (a notebook and a pen).Â </p></li><li><p>LouiseÂ began to manageÂ theÂ ticket queueÂ for issues with theÂ websiteÂ and began to useÂ SCRUM.Â </p></li><li><p>SheÂ attended a 2-day workshop on SCRUM and cameÂ back as a mini-expert.Â </p></li><li><p>Check out
