of something.  Focus on the healing and the integration with your grief. </p></li><li><p>In an emergency, it is all about survival. </p></li><li><p>Reach out to your anchors (people, places, etc.) that root you to your humanity. These are the things that ground you and balance you. </p></li><li><p>Mike gives a great analogy about a spinning top with a weight on it. </p></li><li><p>We talk about being proactive vs. reactive all the time.   </p></li><li><p>John mentions we cannot judge ourselves for our emotional reactions.  We hope we put emotional funds in the bank to get through hard times, but it does not necessarily. </p></li><li><p>Mike wanted to be strong as the man of the house.  This goes back to our conversations of toxic masculinity. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s tough to step aside from your own feelings and really analyze what is happening. </p></li><li><p>Nick makes the point that Mike had to help his 4-year-old through this tough time while he was also experiencing it. </p></li><li><p>Listen to the story of how Mike&rsquo;s 4-year-old acted expressed the situation while playing. </p></li><li><p>The natural state before learning about cultural norms is to talk things out / or play them out. </p></li></ul><a href=#3341---experiencing-stages-of-grief><h2 id=3341---experiencing-stages-of-grief><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>33:41  - Experiencing Stages of Grief </h2></a><p>* Stages of grief were very strange for Mike.  After quitting his job, Mike started to see a grief counselor. </p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;Life does not get easier.  It gets less hard.&rdquo; - Mike Burkhart </p></li><li><p>There were days where he could not get out of bed. </p></li><li><p>Days when Mike did not feel awful made him feel guilt over not feeling worse. </p></li><li><p>In the United States, 1 out of 160 children die in childbirth, which means there are 25,000 – 40,000 parents grieving the loss of a child each year. </p></li><li><p>This is not a risk we want to consider, but it does happen. </p></li><li><p>When this even happened to Mike and people would express their condolences, he didn&rsquo;t care.  It was, more than anything, because he felt others did not understand what he was experiencing. </p></li><li><p>He still isn&rsquo;t sure why. </p></li><li><p>There are communities formed around the loss of a child to help those suffering. </p></li><li><p>This feeling of grief is like nothing Mike has experienced, and his grief counselor is one of his favorite people. </p></li><li><p>Mike needed to know that someone else has felt the same as him.  Being in the state he was in was like being in molasses. </p></li><li><p>Birth is a hectic, nerve wracking process.  Add death to that mix, and it&rsquo;s like someone unhitched a train which ran into a mountain with no tunnel. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s possible for people to recognize you are in pain without being empathetic.  John makes the point it is challenging to ask for a Sherpa to help get through the process. </p></li><li><p>In Western culture death is taboo.  We tend to say we are sorry for someone&rsquo;s loss, but if we have a moment with the person, ask that person to tell you about the person they lost. </p></li><li><p>To reach out to someone who is grieving, to really be helpful, give the person what they need or ask for and not necessarily what you think they want.   </p></li><li><p>It is important to set boundaries with others when you are grieving.  Say no to things not helpful. </p></li><li><p>This is part of the reason Mike wanted to be able to speak to others who have experienced the same loss as his family did. </p></li><li><p>Mike shares some things not to say to people experiencing this time of grief. </p></li><li><p>Is asking someone what they need like giving the person homework?  See
