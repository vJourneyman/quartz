<a href=https://ulysses.app/ rel=noopener>Ulysses</a> or
<a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/ rel=noopener>VS Code</a>.  #Ulysses #VSCode</p></li><li><p>Smart notes make writing easier but not easy.  You need more than just a few words between notes.  Josh says many times what you need is the ideas to be strung together to write a clearer argument.  </p></li><li><p>When considering the challenge of the blank page, Nick thinks back to George Lucas trying to write the script to Star Wars on a tight deadline.   </p></li><li><p>There was a lot of impostor syndrome in the beginning, but Josh has the reverse problem right now - too many ideas to actually execute upon. </p></li><li><p>This is something that has happened to Nick and John with the podcast (so many ideas). </p></li><li><p>With Josh&rsquo;s current rough draft of <a class="internal-link broken">Reclaim</a>, getting started can be a challenge.  It helps to have an introduction and conclusion note because you need something to frame the argument before you begin writing. </p></li><li><p>Josh has to fight editing / correcting while he is writing.  He&rsquo;s trying to remove this from the rough draft, and at present there&rsquo;s some friction in the rewriting process. </p></li></ul><a href=#1004---impact-on-joshs-current-book><h2 id=1004---impact-on-joshs-current-book><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>10:04 - Impact on Josh&rsquo;s Current Book </h2></a><ul><li><p>The process of taking <a class="internal-link broken">Smart Notes</a> has helped Josh to understand the 175 pages he&rsquo;s already written are a bit incoherent. </p></li><li><p>Josh references a tip from <a class="internal-link broken">The Craft of Research</a> in which the author says taking notes faster than you can sort them can cause anxiety. </p></li><li><p>Josh had been feeling anxiety for a number of months regarding the book, and he knew he had already cut out technology usage (i.e. <a href=/Digital-Minimalism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Digital-Minimalism>Digital Minimalism</a>).  The process of smart notes has helped reduce Josh&rsquo;s anxiety. </p></li><li><p>In the beginning Josh was researching and writing but not sorting.  This process (smart notes) has given him the ability to sort in a way that reduces anxiety and keeps the structure there to allow completion of research and write when he is able. </p></li><li><p>Research is now a separate process from writing.  Josh is planning to do research for a month and then write for a couple of weeks to catch up.   </p></li><li><p>Josh has set many deadlines, and they have caused more harm than good for him. </p></li><li><p><a class="internal-link broken">Ryan Holiday</a>&rsquo;s advice to a prospective writer was &ldquo;you can only be a writer if you can&rsquo;t not be a writer.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>For Josh the deadlines create a problem he cannot let go / an unnecessary urgency.  But they did help him get started. </p></li><li><p>As of this recording, Josh is about a year into writing the book and is close to having a rough draft finished but feels he will need to reconstruct a lot of things to make the book more coherent. </p></li></ul><a href=#1404---differentiated-and-more-intense><h2 id=1404---differentiated-and-more-intense><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>14:04 - Differentiated and More Intense </h2></a><ul><li><p><a class="internal-link broken">Reclaim</a> is different than Josh&rsquo;s smart notes book in the sheer amount of information he&rsquo;s putting into it. </p></li><li><p>Part 1 is about the ways technology has invaded our lives. </p></li><li><p>Part 2 is about taking back the linear mind (reading and establishing habits). </p></li><li><p>Part 3 is about how to perform deep work without taking the monastic philosophy.  See also
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-2-the-structure/ rel=noopener>Episode 142</a> for more on deep work philosophies. <a href=/Deep-Work rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Deep-Work>Deep Work</a> <a href=/Episode-142 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Episode-142>Episode 142</a></p></li><li><p>The amount of research Josh has needed to do for the book has been…intense. </p></li><li><p>In this book, Josh is blending some of the ideas of deep work with <a href=/Digital-Minimalism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Digital-Minimalism>digital minimalism</a>. </p></li><li><p>Josh has struggled with what is too much, whether he should  split into two books, etc. </p></li><li><p>Overall it&rsquo;s been a fun experience, and Josh has enjoyed sharing struggles, learnings, and triumphs. </p></li><li><p>Josh has put much of his work on
<a href=https://github.com/Duffney rel=noopener>GitHub</a> to build in public and be transparent. #GitHub</p></li><li><p>It holds Josh accountable, and hopefully it adds value to others in some capacity. </p></li><li><p>For a long time Josh had a single
<a href=https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults rel=noopener>vault in Obsidian</a> for everything. </p></li><li><p>He moved all the notes for Reclaim into its own project vault and stores other notes on writing, Azure, GoLang, etc. in a general vault. </p></li><li><p>Josh wanted to be able to open everything that is Reclaim and shut it once finished. </p></li><li><p>Nick mentioned John was the mastermind behind Nerd Journey&rsquo;s Deep Work series of episodes (starts with
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/book-discussion-deep-work-part-1-the-why/ rel=noopener>Episode 141</a>) and that the smart notes approach was used by John to make the outline. </p></li><li><p>Listen to the back story of how those episodes came to be, how John utilized quotes, and how he pulled ideas from the book by Cal Newport. </p></li></ul><a href=#1932---changing-social-media-habits><h2 id=1932---changing-social-media-habits><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>19:32 - Changing Social Media Habits </h2></a><ul><li><p>As mentioned in
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/focus-create-and-iterate-with-josh-duffney-2-2/ rel=noopener>Episode 124</a>, Josh was doing a write only experiment on social media so that he would only read and respond to posts on Fridays but could create posts any other time. <a href=/Episode-124 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Episode-124>Episode 124</a></p></li><li><p>This is constantly in flux. </p></li><li><p>The experiment worked well to get him away from the tools and break the addiction. </p></li><li><p>It ultimately did not stick.  What Josh does now is check social media for about 30 minutes each day.   </p></li><li><p>Checking social media only one time per week made him too disconnected and isolated, but it was a great way to reset.  If you&rsquo;re not willing to ban yourself for a month the responding on Fridays is a good way to help reset. </p></li><li><p>In a pandemic situation, an online community may be a substitute for in-person community, and throwing that away can be much harder than when an in-person community is more accessible. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s fascinating how much we project our relationships onto social media. </p></li><li><p>A couple of years ago Josh decided to unfollow a lot of folks on Twitter and move them to a list as an experiment.  That got him kicked out of an online community and had massive repercussions.  Getting unfollowed certainly is unsettling. </p></li><li><p>People respect your disconnection from social media, but when you&rsquo;re away for an extended period of time, people may feel like you&rsquo;ve thrown away a relationship with them.  Right now Josh is trying to find the balance. </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much of the psychology of in person interactions transfers to online interactions (on social media platforms). </p></li><li><p>This makes Nick think back to
