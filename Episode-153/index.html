Scott has been there. </p></li><li><p>There are ways to track your tasks (to-do list, a system like
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563 rel=noopener>Getting Things Done</a>) and ways to save things to come back to later (i.e. a helpful URL to read, etc.). </p></li><li><p>Build systems to ensure the least amount of mental expenditure so you&rsquo;re not worried you will forget to do something later. </p></li><li><p>Then there is what&rsquo;s next.   </p></li><li><p>This has come up a lot when people want to learn something new but feel they are super busy in their day job. </p></li><li><p>There&rsquo;s no silver bullet here.  Scott tends to look for trends that he sees emerging.  The only way to this is to read quite a bit. </p></li><li><p>Scott uses a RSS reader to track around 150-200 blogs regularly and scans for trends in what people are talking about in their articles, looking for how this impacts what he has already learned (i.e. does it add to it, extend it, etc.).  This is how you decide what to do with the time. </p></li><li><p>To review, there are 3 aspects: </p></li><li><p>Finding the time </p></li><li><p>Making the most of the time </p></li><li><p>Nick recommends minimizing distractions here. </p></li><li><p>Decide what to do with the time using the lens of what&rsquo;s next </p></li><li><p>Scott says right now there are so many things he could go after. </p></li><li><p>He has to limit what he pursues at present to those things more applicable to his day job.  This would be things that are only one adjacent area away at most. </p></li><li><p>Scott and his wife have no children at home right now, which makes independent exploration a bit easier. </p></li><li><p>When he did have young kids at home, Scott made the decision not to travel so he could connect with them. </p></li><li><p>You can prioritize family time appropriately, but there are spaces of time you can find to listen to a technical podcast while you work out or exercise, for example.  There will be ways to still invest in yourself. </p></li></ul><a href=#1500---generalists-specialists-and-adjacencies><h2 id=1500---generalists-specialists-and-adjacencies><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>15:00 - Generalists, Specialists, and Adjacencies </h2></a><ul><li><p>Scott has debated this with people in the past, feeling like there may have been an episode of Geek Whisperers on this topic. </p></li><li><p>There&rsquo;s a concept of the pie-shaped skillset and a T-shaped skillset. </p></li><li><p>The T-shape usually means you are super deep in one area but have some knowledge of a number of others. </p></li><li><p>The pie shape usually indicates a deep expertise in one area ends up leading you into the next area of expertise. </p></li><li><p>Scott feels like the debate of generalist vs. specialist is a non-debate and that it is taken in the context of time. </p></li><li><p>Over the course of his career Scott has done storage, virtualization, cloud computing, operating systems, some programming, racking and stacking of servers, help desk support, etc.   </p></li><li><p>Looking at all of this holistically you might say Scott is a generalist.  But at any one point in time he was focused in the specific area and whatever skillset he was preparing to do next. </p></li><li><p>When Scott was focused on storage and the opportunity came to shift his focus, he didn&rsquo;t forget everything he knew about storage.  He built onto it knowledge of networking, virtualization, and other things. </p></li><li><p>As IT Professionals we cannot afford to be static.  Technology is not going to stop…even when the robots take over. </p></li><li><p>Technology is constantly changing.  If you call yourself a Technology Professional, your profession is something that is constantly changing.  You have to be prepared to change as your profession changes.  &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like change, you will like irrelevance even less.&rdquo; - army general </p></li><li><p>If you don&rsquo;t embrace the change you will get left behind and miss out on the things that could make your career amazing.  We need to be prepared to see opportunities for ourselves.  Be watching and looking for those opportunities. </p></li><li><p>At any given time you will be specializing in something, but over the course of time, you will likely end up a generalist due to specialization in a number of areas. </p></li><li><p>Scott believes there will be 1,2, or maybe 3 areas where you will be deeper than others.  But he believes you can cultivate that depth. </p></li><li><p>He does not know as much about vSphere as he once did but has learned a great deal about AWS and Kubernetes. </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Implementation details may change, but concepts will still apply.&rdquo; - Scott Lowe </p></li><li><p>A GSX VM is not so different from an AWS EC2 instance. </p></li><li><p>When asked how to learn new things, Scott advises focusing on the concepts first.  </p></li><li><p>Greg Farrow of
<a href=https://packetpushers.net/ rel=noopener>Packet Pushers</a>  said you can learn about how Cisco does BGP, for example, but when you switch to a Juniper device you will have to learn how they do it.  But if you learn BGP concepts first (i.e. transferrable knowledge), the implementation details become easier regardless of the vendor&rsquo;s implementation. <a class="internal-link broken">Packet Pushers</a></p></li><li><p>The reality is that very few people will learn by reading a bunch of
<a href=https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/ rel=noopener>RFCs</a>. </p></li><li><p>Most people will learn by seeing how the RFCs are put into practice by choosing a specific implementation of it (i.e. a vendor flavor).  Coming into this with a concept centric focus will allow the mind to separate a command Cisco uses for some configuration with what is actually happening behind the scenes (the underlying concept). </p></li><li><p>The right time to move into what&rsquo;s next is a tough one to answer.  On one hand waiting until you&rsquo;re ready may be too late.  There is a certain level of readiness you need before making the leap, but that level will depend on someone&rsquo;s comfort level with being uncomfortable. </p></li><li><p>Scott might not encourage someone to make a radical shift early on in their career unless they were in some way prepared for that change. </p></li><li><p>Scott references
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124 rel=noopener>So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You</a> by Cal Newport that talked about finding opportunities by going very deep in an area and proceeding into the adjacent possible for new opportunities. <a class="internal-link broken">So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You</a></p></li><li><p>Scott is also planning to read

<a href=https://www.vmware.com/company/acquisitions/nicira.html rel=noopener>Nicira acquisition</a> (company was around 13,000 at the time). He had been at EMC, which was at around 50,000 people. </p></li><li><p>You could feel the difference in company policies.  It wasn&rsquo;t highly stratified and even less so in the Nicira group Scott joined.  Martin Cassado called it the pirate ship (the networking and security business unit). </p></li><li><p>Scott could speak at marketing events, speak to engineers and product management about the product direction (NSX), and huddling with the CTO team on structure and roadmap of the product. </p></li><li><p>This was a lot of fun for Scott, and he got to work with a dynamic group of individuals. </p></li><li><p>When Scott left VMware in 2018, it was for small company called
<a href=https://www.vmware.com/company/acquisitions/heptio.html rel=noopener>Heptio</a> that had around 50 employees at the time. </p></li><li><p>The field engineering team did pre-sales, professional services, marketing events, product development, etc.  One of Scott&rsquo;s teammates built a tool for customers that turned into a popular open source project. </p></li><li><p>They wrote code, built features, and it was super dynamic. </p></li><li><p>This is one of the things Scott likes about working at Kong.  They are at over 300 employees now. </p></li><li><p>It might be building out a reference architecture, building an infrastructure as code lab, or something else entirely.  </p></li><li><p>For Scott the dynamic nature is a great fit, but it might not be a fit for everyone.  For others, a larger company with more well-defined roles may be attractive, and that&rsquo;s ok. </p></li></ul><a href=#3507---the-full-stack-career-journey-and-closing-thoughts><h2 id=3507---the-full-stack-career-journey-and-closing-thoughts><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>35:07 - The Full Stack Career Journey and Closing Thoughts </h2></a><ul><li><p>Be sure to subscribe to Scott&rsquo;s podcast
