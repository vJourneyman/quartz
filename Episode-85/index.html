<a href=https://www.consul.io/ rel=noopener>Consul</a> at
<a href=https://www.hashicorp.com/ rel=noopener>HashiCorp</a>.Â #HashiCorp</p></li><li><p>Cody creates technical content to educate folks on a specific product / set of products.Â </p></li><li><p>He was in Technical Marketing at VMware before this and also worked previously as a Solution Engineer (SE).Â </p></li><li><p>Tech Marketing has broad strokes, and Cody has been given the freedom to choose the content he will build and the way it is presented rather than being forced to write whitepapers all day.Â </p></li><li><p>Sharing the strategy behind his content creation is effective when speaking to leadership.Â </p></li><li><p>The level of customer engagement is less than when he was a SE, but he&rsquo;s usually brought in for broader conversations (i.e. where do we start / how do we solve problems with the product).Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Most customer-facing activities are paired with a SE.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#713---career-history><h2 id=713---career-history><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>7:13 - Career HistoryÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Cody floats the concept of being accidentally in a place and feels like some of the most interesting career stories happen this way.Â </p></li><li><p>In his twenties, Cody worked for Verizon Wireless, and a friend told him about a contract job at Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) that could lead to a full time position.Â </p></li><li><p>He started as a help desk technician and looked forward to the day he would become a full-time employee.Â  At first Cody thought he could someday be an internal product manager for wireless products.Â </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;You build your definition of who you are based on your previous experiences.&rdquo; - Cody de ArklandÂ </p></li><li><p>Things changed, and Cody got into the security space and was an Internal Product Manager for
<a href=https://www.rsa.com/en-us/products/rsa-securid-suite rel=noopener>RSA SecureID</a>.Â  This is not the same as doing the same job at a vendor.Â  He worked with the vendor and managed relationship and looked at ways to grow the product internally.Â </p></li><li><p>After getting involved with the remote access team he started working with Citrix and had the chance to refresh the infrastructure.Â </p></li><li><p>At this point someone spoke up for his abilities, confirming Cody could handle the new project to build a new architecture and implement it.Â </p></li><li><p>This involved building from the ground up - developing the architecture, learning about storage, administering the solution end-to-end.Â </p></li><li><p>Around year 4 at the company, Cody&rsquo;s reputation as an automation subject matter expert gave him the opportunity to be the Windows guy on the private cloud team.Â </p></li><li><p>This was a much larger transition for Cody.Â  He learned to chain automation together, and the world got way bigger, leading him to become the person who owned automation of infrastructure at his company.Â </p></li><li><p>At some point Cody had an opportunity to speak at

and stayed with the power company.Â </p></li><li><p>The roller coaster continued for about a year.Â </p></li><li><p>When Cody got into automation conversations he felt more confident.Â </p></li><li><p>Cody&rsquo;s advice - &ldquo;Identify the things that excite you and the places your confidence comes from, and build on those.&rdquo;Â </p></li><li><p>Find the things you are good at that make you feel good.Â  Let that be the foundation, or you will crumble.Â </p></li><li><p>Be aware of what the foundation is and the ramifications of completely rebuilding it.Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s one thing to go learn a new skill and try a different career path, but your confidence will be built from the ground up.Â  Give yourself some room to not be confident if this is the case.Â </p></li><li><p>John comments on the talent market for certain roles like Sales Engineering and lack of a formal check-in for people making a transition to this type of role.Â </p></li><li><p>People making that transition need to watch themselves.Â  Itâ€™s important to have a trusted person for support.Â </p></li><li><p>It took Cody a while to find who that was for him.Â </p></li><li><p>Leaving one life for another because of a career change may mean the people you used to work with cannot identify with your new struggles.Â  Their knowledge of you was based on what they experienced from you.Â </p></li><li><p>Be aware of who you are, and keep listening to yourself.Â  There must be a trusted person that allows you to be your most vulnerable self.Â </p></li><li><p>Being vulnerable is a struggle for many of us.Â  People might not know how to respond in the way you need them to respond.Â </p></li><li><p>If there&rsquo;s one thing to be selfish about, it&rsquo;s what you need at your weakest point.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Be aware of going to people who support you in the way you need to be supported.Â </p></li><li><p>Communities are not always setup in ways that encourage this.Â </p></li><li><p>John speaks to toxic masculinity and how this affects our ability to be vulnerable.Â </p></li><li><p>Nick makes the point that we don&rsquo;t want our managers to think we are complete head cases.Â </p></li><li><p>Cody states there is a difference in being successful and feeling successful.Â  Good leaders would ask an employee what makes him / her feel like they are being successful.Â </p></li><li><p>For Cody, success is feeling trusted and depended upon by others.Â </p></li><li><p>Cody knows how to better communicate the way he&rsquo;s feeling and his emotions now than when he was a SE.Â </p></li><li><p>Has a manager ever asked you, &ldquo;what would make you feel successful?&rdquo;Â </p></li><li><p>This provides a manager an opportunity to provide empathy to an employee.Â </p></li><li><p>Getting down into specifics is the only way to help both you and your manager understand what your needs are.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#3355---anxiety-and-the-importance-of-being-an-ear><h2 id=3355---anxiety-and-the-importance-of-being-an-ear><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>33:55 - Anxiety and The Importance of Being an EarÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Cody flips the script on Nick and John and poses a question about people listening without giving advice.Â  Listen to hear the answers.Â </p></li><li><p>Know to ask for what you need when making a request of someone.Â </p></li><li><p>We have a tendency to automatically go into &ldquo;fix&rdquo;
