<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/creating-a-full-stack-career-with-scott-lowe-2-2/ rel=noopener>Episode 153</a> on the &ldquo;adjacent possible.&rdquo;Â </p></li><li><p>Thinking back to the moment where he to took the time to send the e-mail to Altaro, it was an instance of putting himself out there, taking a chance, and having it work out.Â </p></li><li><p>Andy painted a picture to his future employer of what could be based on what they already knew he was capable of doing (i.e. he made the sale of the company needing a new role and that he was the right person for it).Â  Not everyone thinks to do this.Â </p></li><li><p>Andy feels like he might have been doing this within the different departments at the MSP but not to an external company like Altaro (until it happened).Â </p></li></ul><a href=#1223---marketing-is-interesting><h2 id=1223---marketing-is-interesting><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>12:23 - Marketing Is InterestingÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Andy&rsquo;s role at Altaro made him part of the marketing team as a technical resource.Â </p></li><li><p>The only customers Andy would interact with would be prospects (i.e. Pre-Sales).Â </p></li><li><p>He was experienced in Pre-Sales from his time at the MSP and mentioned this when suggesting Altaro hire him.Â  Andy acted as a technical Pre-Sales resource for the US for the product set.Â  It was about 80% Technical Marketing and 20% Pre-Sales.Â </p></li><li><p>Andy might also interact with customers and partners at conferences here and there, but he was never in a tech support type role at Altaro.Â </p></li><li><p>Usually IT skills progression is technically driven.Â  At the time Andy joined Altaro, he had a lot of technical experience under his belt (including being designated as a
<a href=https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/ rel=noopener>Microsoft MVP</a>).Â </p></li><li><p>In the first few years in the role and even now that he&rsquo;s back at Altaro, Andy is learning more about marketing than he ever intended.Â </p></li><li><p>This includes elements of social media, community building, and search engine optimization (SEO).Â </p></li><li><p>Andy never set out to be a marketer, but that is part of the technical evangelist role.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>There are parts of every role that people don&rsquo;t like, but there are parts of marketing that Andy finds super interesting.Â </p></li><li><p>Prospect personas - who is the target audience for a product, an article, etc.Â </p></li><li><p>These skills were exceptionally valuable when it came to public speaking.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Instead of worrying about what he would discuss in a presentation, Andy began focusing more on the audience (something he was not as mindful of before).Â </p></li><li><p>This took Andy&rsquo;s public speaking to the next level because he was taking his knowledge and molding it into something the audience (i.e. people with a business focus, people with a technical focus) could easily digest and understand.Â </p></li><li><p>Something very interesting and way more complicated than Andy ever imagined is search engine optimization (SEO), kind of like Calculus and rocket science combined.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#1836---the-microsoft-mvp><h2 id=1836---the-microsoft-mvp><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>18:36 - The Microsoft MVPÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Around 2013, Andy attended Microsoft TechEd (now named Ignite) in New Orleans.Â </p></li><li><p>At this event, he got roped into the community (a networking group called
<a href="https://twitter.com/thekrewe?lang=en" rel=noopener>The Krewe</a> in addition to absorbing the technical content.Â </p></li><li><p>Through the contacts made in this group Andy became aware of the Microsoft MVP designation.Â  People started asking him if he was one based on the things he was doing.Â </p></li><li><p>Andy also got the chance to get to know
<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithm/ rel=noopener>Keith Mayer</a>, a Microsoft Technical Evangelist in the midwest.Â </p></li><li><p>Keith was a big mentor to Andy at that point in his career, bringing him into a webinar series called Hyper-V from a VMware Admin&rsquo;s Perspective.Â </p></li><li><p>Andy looked at past view counts of other videos in the series and saw it was in the 150,000 - 200,000 range.Â  It was a weird, almost out of body experience and the first time Andy had done anything at that scale. It was also a time where he felt a large amount of anxiety when doing a speaking engagement.Â </p></li><li><p>This experience eventually led Keith to nominate Andy for the Microsoft MVP.Â  Andy had to fill out an application with his contributions and describe their impact / reach for a group of reviewers.Â </p></li><li><p>The MVP has different areas in which it is awarded (awarded once per year).Â  Andy came on originally in the Hyper-V category after coming from a former VMware administration background.Â </p></li><li><p>They have since changed the categories for MVP.Â  At present Andy is considered cloud and datacenter management (includes Windows Server, Hyper-V, PowerShell, Azure, AzureStack).Â Â </p></li><li><p>Some categories like the .NET MVP require code contributions to be considered.Â </p></li><li><p>Being an MVP gets you the designation for a one year period.Â  Each year Andy has to resubmit contributions made during the time since the previous application period, and then it&rsquo;s a waiting game to see if he got into the program for another year.Â </p></li><li><p>The level of effort was about the same to stay in the program after he joined Altaro compared to when he still worked for the MSP and was awarded MVP.Â </p></li><li><p>Take advantage of other programs like the Microsoft MVP that you can involve yourself in:Â </p></li><li><p><a href=https://community.cisco.com/t5/cisco-champion-public-documents/faqs/ta-p/3986825 rel=noopener>Cisco Champion</a>Â </p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.veeam.com/vanguard.html rel=noopener>Veeam Vanguard</a>Â </p></li><li><p><a href=https://vexpert.vmware.com/ rel=noopener>VMware vExpert</a>Â </p></li><li><p>Also check out
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-036-customer-advocacy-programs/ rel=noopener>Episode 36</a> on Customer Advocacy Programs for more ideas.Â </p></li><li><p>Much like certification, the benefit is the journey (getting involved in the community, contributing content, helping others).Â </p></li><li><p>Andy cannot say enough positive things about the Microsoft MVP community.Â </p></li><li><p>If he doesn&rsquo;t know the answer to a specific IT question, he knows someone who does.Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s humbling to be a part of the program.Â  There are also times when the impostor syndrome creeps in.Â </p></li><li><p>Andy feels like the MVP award was additional verification for the folks at Altaro that Andy could do the work needed to be a Technical Evangelist.Â </p></li><li><p>Should we do a show on SEO (search engine optimization) to help bloggers, podcasters, and other content creators in the community?Â  Please let us know what you think!Â </p></li></ul><h2 id=contact-ushttpstwittercomnerdjourney-if-you-need-help-on-the-journey><a href=https://twitter.com/NerdJourney rel=noopener>Contact us</a> if you need help on the journey.</h2></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/Episode-163/ data-ctx="Episode 159" data-src=/Episode-163 class=internal-link>Episode 163</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://graph.nerd-journey.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://graph.nerd-journey.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
