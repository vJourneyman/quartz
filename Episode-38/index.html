In today&rsquo;s episode we have part two of our interview with Jon Hildebrand, where we get to hear the story of his layoff and recovery from being laid off.   </p><p>Original Recording Date: 05-06-2019 </p><p>Topics – Jon Hildebrand Part 2 - Layoff and Recovery </p><p>===================================== </p><a href=#155lightedgelayoff><h2 id=155lightedgelayoff><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1:55 LightEdge Layoff </h2></a><p>* During year 4 at LightEdge, things were on the uptick like implementing new technologies, bringing in public cloud, etc. </p><ul><li><p>Azure was a preferred partner, and they were looking heavily at
<a href=https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/ rel=noopener>Azure Stack</a>.   </p></li><li><p>They also looked at network virtualization and other technologies specific to service providers that could add greater value / provide additional services to customers. </p></li><li><p>There were internal rumblings about acquiring another company. </p></li><li><p>Borrowing money for an endeavor like this often leads to trimming high salaried positions. </p></li><li><p>On the morning of April 16th, 2018 Jon was asked to come into his manager&rsquo;s office and was let go. </p></li><li><p>The experience was surreal.  He had heard of others experiencing this but had never experienced it himself. </p></li><li><p>They gave him no time to box anything up (told he could come do that in a week) to prevent others at the company from seeing what was happening. </p></li><li><p>Jon told his wife &ldquo;I guess I get to go look for a new job.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>Jon was supposed to present at a VMUG UserCon in St. Louis the next day and no longer had a laptop to use.  He was more worried about this at the time than the fact that he had just lost his job. </p></li><li><p>There was a feeling of a weight being lifted off his shoulders. </p></li><li><p>During the last couple of years with LightEdge, Jon had been blogging and attended analyst type events like
<a href=https://techfieldday.com/ rel=noopener>Tech Field Day</a>. </p></li><li><p>Jon&rsquo;s manager encouraged him to attend these events as a personal benefit and a benefit to the organization. </p></li><li><p>While Jon was at these events, he realized there was something else he was looking for but couldn&rsquo;t specifically identify it. </p></li><li><p>Losing his job allowed him to focus on finding what he really wanted to do. </p></li><li><p>Jon&rsquo;s best job search advice is to expand the personal network.  Always be in communication with even the farthest fringes of your network. </p></li><li><p>He ran into end of fiscal quarters with different companies when applying. </p></li><li><p>Jon ran into Andrew Miller of
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>Rubrik</a> (at the time) and ended up starting the interview process with that company, but their timeline did not align with his. </p></li><li><p>One of the folks at Rubrik encouraged him to look at Cohesity as an option. </p></li><li><p>Jon found an open position for a Technical Marketer role and applied. </p></li><li><p>Howard Marks happened to drop Jon&rsquo;s name as a potential candidate for the same role. </p></li><li><p>Shortly thereafter, a whirlwind Friday consisting of 4 back-to-back interviews transpired.  Jon had an offer by the following Wednesday. </p></li><li><p>He did not know how much of a pay bump the job would offer, but it turned out to be around 33%. </p></li><li><p>The personal network helped him land that specific position. </p></li><li><p>In a roundabout way, starting his career as a consultant put Jon on the path to where he is now. </p></li><li><p>At the end of the day it is about education.  This role allows Jon to interact with the community in a number of ways. </p></li><li><p>He&rsquo;s been a presenter at Tech Field Day a few times now after having previously been a delegate. </p></li><li><p>Jon&rsquo;s manager was the reason he was content at LightEdge.  The level of commitment to Jon&rsquo;s development this manager showed was atypical and more like a mentor / leader, but it was a major contributor to his later success. </p></li><li><p>Words of wisdom from Jon&rsquo;s former manager - &ldquo;All of my best employees should quit on me at some point.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>If you find a mentor who inspires you in this way, learn as much as you can. </p></li><li><p>Jon eventually needed the push out of the nest. </p></li><li><p>There is something to be said about being in a comfortable position. Jon felt like the last 18 months at LightEdge may have left him blinded by comfort.   </p></li><li><p>The outlet was going to tech events and getting involved in blogging. </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re two different individuals, but I never see that person in the office.  I want you to marry those two individuals.&rdquo;    </p></li><li><p>It took a compelling event to eventually marry these. </p></li><li><p>The combination of technology and talking to people without being beholden to a sales pipeline is extremely enjoyable for Jon. </p></li><li><p>How did turning a hobby into a career turn out for Jon?  Does he still like it? </p></li></ul><a href=#3208-lessons-learned><h2 id=3208-lessons-learned><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>32:08 Lessons Learned </h2></a><ul><li><p>Jon never would have imagined he would do something that required public speaking. </p></li><li><p>Getting challenged during your career tees you up to look for the next challenge. </p></li><li><p>Jon likes his challenges to be a little greater than they used to be. </p></li><li><p>First, he had to conquer the people problem.  From there, that exploded the personal network.  He had so many people tell him that, and then he lived it.  </p></li><li><p>It seems like Jon went through the Area of Destiny exercise mentioned in
<a href=http://nerd-journey.com/episode-020-reasons-to-quit-area-of-destiny-and-finding-your-area-of-destiny/ rel=noopener>Episode 20</a>. </p></li><li><p>What&rsquo;s next for Jon? </p></li><li><p>He&rsquo;s told himself a number of times he will never go into management.  If you don&rsquo;t feel like you can manage people, go and do it. </p></li><li><p>Think back to
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592 rel=noopener>The Phoenix Project</a>. </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;The only thing holding yourself back is you.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>Jon talks about being locked in the back of a truck with
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>Chris Colotti</a>.  Should we do a follow up episode with both of them? </p></li><li><p>How could someone get into Technical Marketing? </p></li><li><p>Look into Tech Field Day events. </p></li><li><p>Can you write and articulate well in your blogs? </p></li><li><p>All you need is that one person to read it and say &ldquo;this is good stuff.  I agree with that.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>Writing a first blog post is difficult for people, but you have to start somewhere. </p></li><li><p>Contact Jon Hildebrand on Twitter
