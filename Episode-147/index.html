These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding tasks that are often done while distracted which are easy to replicate and do not create a lot of value in the world </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. </p></blockquote><p>We found this compelling and wanted to bring the information to our listeners. </p><a href=#438---rule-4-drain-the-shallows-part-2><h2 id=438---rule-4-drain-the-shallows-part-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4:38 - Rule #4 Drain the Shallows (Part 2!) </h2></a><p>Eliminating as much shallow work as possible can drive success and excellence. There’s a limit to the shallow work we can eliminate while still maintaining our positions and there’s a maximum amount of deep work we can do a day. However, bias yourself towards the deep over the shallow. </p><a href=#519---ask-your-boss-for-a-shallow-work-budget><h3 id=519---ask-your-boss-for-a-shallow-work-budget><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>5:19 - Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget </h3></a><p>Describe the concept of Deep Work to your boss and ask what percentage of your time should be spent doing deep vs. shallow. This can drive down the expectation to be extremely connected.  </p><p>The budget might also change your behavior, for example, biasing you against status update meetings in favor of being accountable for deadlines.  </p><p>It will also alert you if you and your boss have wildly differing ideas about how much of your time should be spent on shallow work.

Even podcast emails don’t rise to that level.  I definitely get messages as a result of the podcast, but the volume does not overwhelm me to the point that I am losing time responding.  People usually have fairly specific asks, and I&rsquo;m happy to spend the time with them.  I publish a way for people to schedule time with me.  If I started to get 5 messages a day asking for help with resume writing, for example, then maybe I would create a document of resources and share that with people first before offering time to meet with them 1-1. </p></li><li><p>John: As for the second tip, I totally believe that. Email ping-pong, the instinct to prepare a minimally responsive email that puts the responsibility on someone else, is something that I fight every day.  We have access to a tool called group availability, for example, that allows me to look up available times for me and other colleagues and provide it to someone wanting to have a discussion. </p></li><li><p>Nick: I like the idea of setting expectations for e-mail responses.  I can say I’ve not really done that well with others.  They only know what they’ve observed.  We can&rsquo;t all create a generic contact mailbox because we&rsquo;re not all college professors.  This is really about scaling yourself and so the attention to responding does not take away from the work you need to do.  I’m skeptical of the “make others do more work” approach.  I like the concept, but I’m skeptical of whether people really read e-mail thoroughly enough for it to be effective.  It makes me think back to
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/ rel=noopener>Episode 137</a> and <a href=/Don-Jones rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Don-Jones>Don Jones</a>&rsquo; 4-page e-mail response.  I totally understand not responding if you’re on CC and a response is not required. <a href=/Episode-137 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Episode-137>Episode 137</a></p></li><li><p>Nick: As for just plain not responding, I see what Newport is saying, but I’m also not a popular author who is getting a ton of fan mail (i.e. the general inquiries e-mail approach).  I also don&rsquo;t want people to think I&rsquo;m a jerk if I don&rsquo;t respond to an inquiry. </p></li><li><p>John: That makes sense to me.  It&rsquo;s about managing e-mail when there is a conflict.  If there&rsquo;s no conflict, you don&rsquo;t need to use these tools.  I think that 2nd tip about laying out a process is helpful.  You can cut out a lot of the things that could turn into 10 e-mails. </p></li><li><p>Nick: You remove the ambiguity by giving the person on the other side a clear way to make a decision. </p></li><li><p>John: And if they don&rsquo;t agree with the steps, they can say so.  You can preface the whole thing with &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what I propose,&rdquo; and that gives them permission to disagree with the process. </p></li><li><p>Nick: This also helps break the focus on the quick response to just get something back to the sender. </p></li><li><p>John: How quickly you respond is interesting compared to the quality of your response when you do respond.  A fast response can often be virtually useless and could make it ambiguous on who should take the next action. </p></li><li><p>Listen to Nick and John riff back and forth with some examples based on this comment. </p></li><li><p><input disabled type=checkbox> John: The second tip seems the most useful.  I certainly get ambiguous things and am CC&rsquo;d on things for visibility (no response required).  There are few things I&rsquo;ve done where I need people to do more work first.  If there&rsquo;s something like that I have already published a thing to read.  I have had a number of folks reach out to me about joining Google from VMware. Since this has been the thing that has happened the most often for those thinking about joining Google / just joining Google (i.e. wanting more information from me), I probably should write something up. </p></li><li><p>Nick: That&rsquo;s more homework for you, John, very much like last week.  If you&rsquo;re out there and you&rsquo;re tracking John&rsquo;s homework assignment Tweet at us #johnwhitemetrics or #vjourneymanmetrics. </p></li></ul><a href=#4254---conclusion><h2 id=4254---conclusion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>42:54 - Conclusion </h2></a><p>Deep work is a pragmatic choice to focus on the ability to concentrate without distraction and get valuable work done.

<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-David-Allen-audiobook/dp/B01B6WSK5C rel=noopener>Getting Things Done</a>, focused on productivity, and adds in the dimensions of depth-of-meaning and long-term value. This book has helped me figure out my foundational philosophy of the type of work I want to do and which of the tasks in front of me align with that philosophy.  We&rsquo;re back on philosophy.   </p></li><li><p>Nick: I believe it and feel it applies for me.  The key word in all of this is struggle.  It really is a struggle to change your behavior, regardless of what it is.  This book is about breaking undesirable habits that you didn&rsquo;t know were undesirable until you read it or some like it.  I think back to

Upon further review, Newport is coming from a position in which he has the ability to do this (as a professor).  He can control his schedule to that degree.  It&rsquo;s our job to take the lesson and apply the underlying meaning instead of the surface meaning.  It might seem inflexible, but can you look past the hard and fast rule as stated and look at the underlying meaning.  Take the structure and learn from it. </p></li></ul><a href=#does-it-make-me-want-to-change-behavior-and-if-so-what-will-i-change-to-align-myself-with-this-idea-conclusion-and-book-as-a-whole><h4 id=does-it-make-me-want-to-change-behavior-and-if-so-what-will-i-change-to-align-myself-with-this-idea-conclusion-and-book-as-a-whole><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Does it make me want to change behavior, and if so, what will I change to align myself with this idea (conclusion and book as a whole)? </h4></a><ul><li><p>John: It makes me want to change, and I’ve already started changing. I’ve re-organized my <a href=/Career-Goals rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Career-Goals>Career Goals</a> around doing deep work. I’ve started to quantify how I’m spending my time with a timeflip. I’ve started to push back on the amount of shallow work I’m doing, or at least how I’m doing it (i.e. batching, time blocking). This has been a revolutionary read for me.   I am going to keep on iterating and know I have not committed to getting every part of this implemented. I was to switch over to this system, but the way to get there is incrementally. </p></li><li><p>Nick: I know the payoff is worth it.  I know to advance in my field I need to be doing my best work.  Creating an environment / atmosphere that enables me to do that kind of work aligns with things like promotions, pay raises, and aligns with my personal values.  I don&rsquo;t think I have done as much work as you in fundamentally changing my behavior.  I don&rsquo;t think I have done enough but would like to change the amount of changes.  I want to be more consistent and change small things at a time.  This book is about breaking / changing bad habits and is also about self-care.  Not everyone will think of it that way, but the boundaries are helpful. I think of the advice in the book in a similar light to
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/The-Power-of-When-audiobook/dp/B01KGEGR7E rel=noopener>The Power of When</a> by <a class="internal-link broken">Michael Breus</a> in that even small changes will help you improve.  To your point about iterating, I think small changes are the key.  For me it&rsquo;s things like turning off push notifications for e-mail (which I have done).  Does it mean I still check it too much?  Maybe.  I think if you try to change everything suggested in the book at the same time, you will fail.  You&rsquo;ll fall off the horse.  You need to pick something (like a small win) and measure to see if it&rsquo;s working / you&rsquo;ve mastered it.  Part of this process is tracking, checking in on yourself.  If you don&rsquo;t do that, you&rsquo;ll fall back into old habits, and for me I think that&rsquo;s the problem (trying to do too many at once and need to get success from just one or two).  Treat it like the <a class="internal-link broken">Dave Ramsey</a> debt snowball. <a class="internal-link broken">The Power of When</a></p></li><li><p>John: One action has a virtuous cycle which frees up attention and resources to work on the next thing, etc.  I like that idea. </p></li><li><p>Nick: Maybe the first thing you start with is being ok with boredom and focusing on a problem you need to solve.  Maybe that makes a huge difference for you.  But you have to practice it. </p></li><li><p>John: I&rsquo;ve found what you&rsquo;re talking about to be a very compelling way to do this.  Also the logical part of your brain and motivating the elephant are what the first part of this book are about.  Decide if you agree with it, first.  I&rsquo;m interested in what other people have done in listening to this series.  Did it motivate you to read or listen to the book? </p></li><li><p>Nick: DM us on Twitter if you want a free copy of the book on Audible. </p></li><li><p>John: Let us know what your reaction has been to the content. </p></li><li><p>Nick: Are there other sources containing similar advice that we haven&rsquo;t read?  We&rsquo;d be interested to explore them. </p></li><li><p>John: I&rsquo;d be very interested in reading conflicting advice if anyone wants to recommend some. </p></li><li><p>Nick: That is the <a href=/The-Craftsman-Approach-to-Tool-Selection rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/The-Craftsman-Approach-to-Tool-Selection>The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection</a> at work.    <a href=/Deep-Work rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Deep-Work>Deep Work</a></p></li><li><p>Even though this series has reached its conclusion, there are more interviews with new guests coming your way soon! </p></li><li><p>Maybe from time to time we should share where we are on the deep work journey? </p></li></ul><h2 id=contact-ushttpstwittercomnerdjourney-if-youve-read-deep-work-and-have-reactions-you-think-we-missed-wed-like-to-hear-from-you-reach-out-if-you-have-other-books-youd-recommend-or-if-you-need-help-on-the-journey><a href=https://twitter.com/NerdJourney rel=noopener>Contact us</a> if you&rsquo;ve read Deep Work and have reactions you think we missed; we&rsquo;d like to hear from you.
