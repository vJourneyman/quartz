These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.&rdquo; </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Shallow Work: &ldquo;Non-cognitively demanding tasks that are often done while distracted which are easy to replicate and do not create a lot of value in the world&rdquo; </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Deep Work Hypothesis: &ldquo;The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.&rdquo; </p></blockquote><ul><li><p>You can be more valuable as worker if you are able to perform deep work. </p></li><li><p>Reactions </p></li><li><p>John </p></li><li><p>John believes that work demanding high levels of cognitive function is most correlated with high value / what employers are willing to pay for.  You can control how well you are able to perform really difficult tasks requiring extreme focus. </p></li><li><p>I&rsquo;m sure there are exceptions.  You can control how effectively you work. </p></li><li><p>John finds himself being asked to do work that seems more administrative than deep and cognitive.  He finds it challenging to understand how the shallow work items contribute to the success of his job.  This is across the board with jobs John has had over time, making him want to focus on the deep stuff. </p></li><li><p>There are unspoken expectations to reply to e-mail quickly, for example. </p></li><li><p>The crowding in of highly distracted administrative work over the work that correlates long term with success as an employee makes John want to change.  He wants to be a high value worker. </p></li><li><p>John hasn&rsquo;t kept up an active blog.  He wonders what has kept him from doing that and feels it is in line with professional growth. </p></li><li><p>John plans to do what he can to maximize the deep work and concentrate the shallow work into an organized fashion.  He&rsquo;ll have to figure out how the deep work is measurably aligned with success in the work place and do more of it. </p></li><li><p>Nick </p></li><li><p>When you see people make breakthroughs / reaching high levels, they have done deep work in some form.  They had periods where they needed to concentrate deeply and make a big enough impact, adding knowledge to their field. </p></li><li><p>Sometimes because of the number of e-mails / tasks on your plate the shallow things end up getting in the way of what we should really be doing (the deep work). </p></li><li><p>Nick thinks back to all the quality outcomes that happen for people doing the deep work, and he wants more of it. </p></li><li><p>You can&rsquo;t do deep work 100% of the time.  It is cognitively impossible.  Nick feels he needs to take more time dedicated to focus, inserting more guardrails on protecting this time. </p></li></ul><a href=#1952---chapter-1---deep-work-is-valuable><h2 id=1952---chapter-1---deep-work-is-valuable><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>19:52 - Chapter 1 - Deep Work is Valuable </h2></a><ul><li><p>Technology is displacing human labor when that labor is used in a way that is easily automated (often called &ldquo;The Great Restructuring&rdquo;).   </p></li><li><p>Three groups to benefit from the restructuring </p></li><li><p>Highly skilled workers </p></li><li><p>Superstars (at tops of their fields) </p></li><li><p>Owners </p></li><li><p>These people have access to capital to fund the development.  We cannot control this aspect of capital to invest, so the book focuses on the first two groups. </p></li><li><p>Core abilities to thrive in this new economy </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;The ability to quickly master hard things&rdquo;  </p></li></ul><p>*  &ldquo;The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed&rdquo; </p><ul><li><p>Newport makes points that deep work both helps you quickly learn hard things and produce at an elite level. </p></li><li><p>John dives into what each of these mean, referencing Newport&rsquo;s citing of Dan Coyle&rsquo;s
