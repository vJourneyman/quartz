<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkortenetworknerd/ rel=noopener>Nick Korte</a> (
<a href=https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_/ rel=noopener>@NetworkNerd_</a>), two Pre-Sales Technical Engineers who are hoping to bring you the IT career advice that we wish we&rsquo;d been given earlier in our careers. In today&rsquo;s episode we discuss Leadership and Supporting Employee Potential with Paul Green, Chief Development Officer of Angel MedFlight.   </p><p>Original Recording Date: 09-16-2020 </p><p>Topics – Leadership and Supporting Employee Potential </p><p>=========================== </p><a href=#0212---meet-paul-green><h2 id=0212---meet-paul-green><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>02:12 - Meet Paul Green </h2></a><ul><li><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulgreen130/ rel=noopener>Paul Green</a> is the Chief Development officer at
<a href=https://www.angelmedflight.com/ rel=noopener>Angel MedFlight Worldwide Air Ambulance</a> and was the CIO (Chief Information Officer) when he started with the company. <a href=/Paul-Green rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Paul-Green>Paul Green</a> #AngelMedFlight</p></li><li><p>Paul held the title of CIO at his previous company as well. </p></li><li><p>He started in IT in 1998 as a kid thrust into a Network Administrator position at a public company.  No one else there knew much about computers. </p></li><li><p>The CFO was confident Paul knew more than other employees at the company. </p></li><li><p>Paul shares a story about working as a night auditor while in college and setting up the new property management system for a fellow employee who struggled to get it right. </p></li><li><p>Listen to the challenges of running Dell Optiplex hardware on Windows 98 from back in the day.  Paul compares the difference in computer setup then vs. now. </p></li><li><p>Coming through the ranks back then required real learning.  Multiple iterations were required to get better. </p></li><li><p>IT now is about software more than hardware (was previously more about hardware). </p></li><li><p>There were few best practices back then and a lot of people just figuring things out on their own.   </p></li><li><p>This past experience allows Paul to think about things different than others. </p></li><li><p>Instead of thinking outside the box, Paul didn&rsquo;t realize there was a box in the first place. </p></li><li><p>Paul did not start in IT to do things a certain way.  He was doing his own thing and followed his father and grandfather&rsquo;s examples of doing things right the first time. </p></li><li><p>Something as simple as zip tying wires inside a server case mattered.  Attention to the small details communicates to others that you are about the work you are doing. </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;The details are what really count in IT.&rdquo; - Paul Green </p></li><li><p>The difference in having a nice application and having a really good application is the details.  Take Instagram vs. Facebook for example. </p></li><li><p>John mentions the idea of polish as an accumulation of many details.  Think inside the box before you start thinking outside. </p></li><li><p>Is this attention to detail Paul mentioned something managers appreciate today? </p></li><li><p>It depends on the manager&rsquo;s experience.  Paul had a CFO who cared nothing about details (only completion) and contrasts with his current CFO who cares about every detail. </p></li><li><p>It was more about how &ldquo;clean&rdquo; something was done, which lends itself well to paying attention to details. </p></li></ul><a href=#1144---management-vs-leadership><h2 id=1144---management-vs-leadership><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>11:44 - <a class="internal-link broken">Management vs. Leadership</a> </h2></a><ul><li><p>Paul has seen the entire spectrum of management. </p></li><li><p>If Paul is not willing to do something himself, he should never have to ask an employee to do it. </p></li><li><p>He likes to work alongside his employees to accomplish goals while simultaneously helping support their growth. </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my job to tell you how to do your job.  It&rsquo;s my job to help you figure out how to do it on your own.&rdquo; - Paul Green </p></li><li><p>Paul likes to ask questions and use analogies to help employees think through a situation.  It&rsquo;s important to pay attention to how employees learn and understand things.  <a class="internal-link broken">Coaching vs. Directing</a></p></li><li><p>Paul enjoys having lunch with employees to understand their personality, how they interact, and how they work.   </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have supervisors, and I don&rsquo;t have managers.  I only have leaders.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>Every single person with a staff is a leader whose job is to make the people below them better, which subsequently makes the leader better and the organization better. </p></li><li><p>Paul references
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591846447 rel=noopener>Start with Why</a> by <a href=/Simon-Sinek rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Simon-Sinek>Simon Sinek</a> as a great read. <a href=/Start-with-Why rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Start-with-Why>Start With Why</a> </p></li><li><p>He started a book club inside the company, and they are currently reading Start with Why.  The next book will be
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Talking-to-Strangers-audiobook/dp/B07NJCG1XS/ rel=noopener>Talking to Strangers</a>.  Understand why you are doing something, and learn how to talk to the people for which you are doing it. <a href=/Talking-to-Strangers rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Talking-to-Strangers>Talking to Strangers</a></p></li><li><p>IT leaders need to put together the right IT to accomplish the company&rsquo;s mission.  Understand operations within the company to associate the proper IT with the organization. </p></li><li><p>Stop worrying about what a new tech product is.  Find the one that fits the situation and goal the best.  Tag lines, terms, and fancy acronyms don&rsquo;t mean much.  What gives my company&rsquo;s goal the best chance to succeed? </p></li><li><p>Nick references
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Three-Signs-Miserable-Job/dp/B000VA1PCG rel=noopener>Three Signs of a Miserable Job</a> by <a href=/Patrick-Lencioni rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Patrick-Lencioni>Patrick Lencioni</a> and mentions many employees have trouble making the connection between what they do and the purpose of the company. <a class="internal-link broken">Three Signs of a Miserable Job</a></p></li><li><p>Paul says giving someone a purpose helps them excel. </p></li><li><p>When speaking of his current company, Paul says they don&rsquo;t change the world.  But, the people the company has helped might just change the world one day because of a second chance. </p></li><li><p>Paul lets his employees know they don&rsquo;t just do IT.  Employees are the fundamental underlying reason why Angel MedFlight can do what it does…change people&rsquo;s lives.  Being better at the job helps people facing the patients be better at their job. </p></li><li><p>We have to ensure people understand the role they play in these outcomes. </p></li><li><p>This is a challenge in large organizations.  We discuss VMware, Apple, Chick-Fil-A, In-N-Out Burger as examples of companies with very overwhelmingly positive morale and how this creates customer loyalty. </p></li><li><p>John references
<a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/ rel=noopener>Idiocracy</a> and an example of a very unenthusiastic employee in a Costco in the movie. <a href=/Idiocracy rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Idiocracy>Idiocracy</a></p></li><li><p>Enthusiasm for your organization is infectious.  Paul wants to feel that when people from other organizations talk with him. </p></li><li><p>How do leaders get people on board in a way that isn&rsquo;t just saying the words? </p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t tell someone how to do something.  Show them what a company means to you so others can be onboard. </p></li><li><p>Paul tries to be relatable to others as much as possible and shares an interesting story about a discussion with the CFO about his influence on employees. </p></li><li><p>Consistently showing employees that you aren&rsquo;t going to lead them down the wrong path builds rapport and trust. </p></li><li><p>Showing employees that anything is possible encourages them to think in a similar manner. </p></li><li><p>For those just starting out in IT, say yes to what you&rsquo;re asked to do unless there&rsquo;s no way you can do it.  Take time to learn how, and use proper resources.   </p></li><li><p>Be willing to do what it takes, and ask for more work. </p></li><li><p>When you have spare time, asking a leader for something else to work on shows your dedication.  This helps the leader put you in a position to get more work that is a greater challenge.  Paul shares a great example of how he has done this for an existing employee and how it changed that person&rsquo;s trajectory and increased self-esteem. </p></li><li><p>John points out this is a stretch goal and that leaders can help make employees successful in getting to those goals. </p></li><li><p>Paul says if something is a huge stretch, help prepare the employee for it in chunks.  Give projects which allow the employee can succeed, and build on that. </p></li><li><p>33:16 - Detecting and Supporting <a href=/Employee-Potential rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Employee-Potential>Employee Potential</a> </p></li><li><p>Sometimes people surprise you.  Paul has hired many people over the years. </p></li><li><p>During the hiring process, Paul seeks to ask questions a certain way to determine if the employee is committed to their work and will give full effort. </p></li><li><p>Some of the questions are outlandish.  He asks real world questions to test the thought process. </p></li><li><p>Paul is looking for thought process, attitude, mindset, and whether the person is a fit with the team more so than the educational background. </p></li><li><p>A team is better than one person.  Paul mentions
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_%28film%29 rel=noopener>Moneyball</a> and its ties to the formation of a team. <a href=/Moneyball rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Moneyball>Moneyball</a> <a href=/Michael-Lewis rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Michael-Lewis>Michael Lewis</a></p></li><li><p>The highest draft pick may not make the team better.  It&rsquo;s about how you will integrate the new team member. </p></li><li><p>Looking outside IT is fine.  For help desk, find someone who can communicate, describe the thought process behind what they are doing, etc.   </p></li><li><p>Look at the role, and find the right fit for the role (i.e. skills fit vs. traditional background). </p></li><li><p>Paul shares a great story about his lead developer (a Marine who was the lead mechanic on a helicopter and held a job deployed on a boat for a number of years).  The environment in which this person worked was very different than those many in IT work in today. </p></li><li><p>Putting together people from different background and different walks of life is almost like putting together a team of superheroes.  Paul&rsquo;s team is a unique group that really gels well together and has delivered some amazing outcomes.  &ldquo;The box doesn&rsquo;t exist for my team.&rdquo; </p></li><li><p>Nick mentions
