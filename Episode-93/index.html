In today&rsquo;s episode we discuss Leadership and Supporting Employee Potential with Paul Green, Chief Development Officer of Angel MedFlight.Â Â Â </p><p>Original Recording Date: 09-16-2020Â </p><p>Topics â€“ Leadership and Supporting Employee PotentialÂ </p><p>===========================Â </p><a href=#0212---meet-paul-green><h2 id=0212---meet-paul-green><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>02:12 - Meet Paul GreenÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulgreen130/ rel=noopener>Paul Green</a> is the Chief Development officer at
<a href=https://www.angelmedflight.com/ rel=noopener>Angel MedFlight Worldwide Air Ambulance</a> and was the CIO (Chief Information Officer) when he started with the company.Â <a href=/Paul-Green rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Paul-Green>Paul Green</a> #AngelMedFlight</p></li><li><p>Paul held the title of CIO at his previous company as well.Â </p></li><li><p>He started in IT in 1998 as a kid thrust into a Network Administrator position at a public company.Â  No one else there knew much about computers.Â </p></li><li><p>The CFO was confident Paul knew more than other employees at the company.Â </p></li><li><p>Paul shares a story about working as a night auditor while in college and setting up the new property management system for a fellow employee who struggled to get it right.Â </p></li><li><p>Listen to the challenges of running Dell Optiplex hardware on Windows 98 from back in the day.Â  Paul compares the difference in computer setup then vs. now.Â </p></li><li><p>Coming through the ranks back then required real learning.Â  Multiple iterations were required to get better.Â </p></li><li><p>IT now is about software more than hardware (was previously more about hardware).Â </p></li><li><p>There were few best practices back then and a lot of people just figuring things out on their own.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>This past experience allows Paul to think about things different than others.Â </p></li><li><p>Instead of thinking outside the box, Paul didn&rsquo;t realize there was a box in the first place.Â </p></li><li><p>Paul did not start in IT to do things a certain way.Â  He was doing his own thing and followed his father and grandfather&rsquo;s examples of doing things right the first time.Â </p></li><li><p>Something as simple as zip tying wires inside a server case mattered.Â  Attention to the small details communicates to others that you are about the work you are doing.Â </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;The details are what really count in IT.&rdquo; - Paul GreenÂ </p></li><li><p>The difference in having a nice application and having a really good application is the details.Â  Take Instagram vs. Facebook for example.Â </p></li><li><p>John mentions the idea of polish as an accumulation of many details.Â  Think inside the box before you start thinking outside.Â </p></li><li><p>Is this attention to detail Paul mentioned something managers appreciate today?Â </p></li><li><p>It depends on the manager&rsquo;s experience.Â  Paul had a CFO who cared nothing about details (only completion) and contrasts with his current CFO who cares about every detail.Â </p></li><li><p>It was more about how &ldquo;clean&rdquo; something was done, which lends itself well to paying attention to details.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#1144---management-vs-leadership><h2 id=1144---management-vs-leadership><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>11:44 - <a class="internal-link broken">Management vs. Leadership</a>Â </h2></a><ul><li><p>Paul has seen the entire spectrum of management.Â </p></li><li><p>If Paul is not willing to do something himself, he should never have to ask an employee to do it.Â </p></li><li><p>He likes to work alongside his employees to accomplish goals while simultaneously helping support their growth.Â </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my job to tell you how to do your job.Â  It&rsquo;s my job to help you figure out how to do it on your own.&rdquo; - Paul GreenÂ </p></li><li><p>Paul likes to ask questions and use analogies to help employees think through a situation.Â  It&rsquo;s important to pay attention to how employees learn and understand things.Â  <a class="internal-link broken">Coaching vs. Directing</a></p></li><li><p>Paul enjoys having lunch with employees to understand their personality, how they interact, and how they work.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have supervisors, and I don&rsquo;t have managers.Â  I only have leaders.&rdquo;Â </p></li><li><p>Every single person with a staff is a leader whose job is to make the people below them better, which subsequently makes the leader better and the organization better.Â </p></li><li><p>Paul references
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591846447 rel=noopener>Start with Why</a> by <a class="internal-link broken">Simon Sinek</a> as a great read. <a class="internal-link broken">Start With Why</a>Â </p></li><li><p>He started a book club inside the company, and they are currently reading Start with Why.Â  The next book will be
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Talking-to-Strangers-audiobook/dp/B07NJCG1XS/ rel=noopener>Talking to Strangers</a>.Â  Understand why you are doing something, and learn how to talk to the people for which you are doing it.Â <a class="internal-link broken">Talking to Strangers</a></p></li><li><p>IT leaders need to put together the right IT to accomplish the company&rsquo;s mission.Â  Understand operations within the company to associate the proper IT with the organization.Â </p></li><li><p>Stop worrying about what a new tech product is.Â  Find the one that fits the situation and goal the best.Â  Tag lines, terms, and fancy acronyms don&rsquo;t mean much.Â  What gives my company&rsquo;s goal the best chance to succeed?Â </p></li><li><p>Nick references
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Three-Signs-Miserable-Job/dp/B000VA1PCG rel=noopener>Three Signs of a Miserable Job</a> by <a class="internal-link broken">Patrick Lencioni</a> and mentions many employees have trouble making the connection between what they do and the purpose of the company.Â <a class="internal-link broken">Three Signs of a Miserable Job</a></p></li><li><p>Paul says giving someone a purpose helps them excel.Â </p></li><li><p>When speaking of his current company, Paul says they don&rsquo;t change the world.Â  But, the people the company has helped might just change the world one day because of a second chance.Â </p></li><li><p>Paul lets his employees know they don&rsquo;t just do IT.Â  Employees are the fundamental underlying reason why Angel MedFlight can do what it doesâ€¦change people&rsquo;s lives.Â  Being better at the job helps people facing the patients be better at their job.Â </p></li><li><p>We have to ensure people understand the role they play in these outcomes.Â </p></li><li><p>This is a challenge in large organizations.Â  We discuss VMware, Apple, Chick-Fil-A, In-N-Out Burger as examples of companies with very overwhelmingly positive morale and how this creates customer loyalty.Â </p></li><li><p>John references
