In today&rsquo;s episode we discuss the journey that Ashley Connell, the founder of Prowess Project, took to get from idea to fully operational.   </p><p>Original Recording Date: 09-30-2020 </p><p>Topics – Building Your Own Business From Idea to Operations <a href=/Ashley-Connell rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Ashley-Connell>Ashley Connell</a> #Prowess <a class="internal-link broken">Women in Technology</a></p><p>============================================================ </p><a href=#220---the-start-of-something-new><h2 id=220---the-start-of-something-new><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2:20 - The Start of Something New </h2></a><ul><li><p>The morning just before A10 lost their biggest client, Ashley had a great idea for a new business. </p></li><li><p>She had recently read
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Built-Sell-Creating-Business-Without-ebook/dp/B004IYISQW rel=noopener>Built to Sell</a> by <a href=/John-Warrillow rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/John-Warrillow>John Warrillow</a> in a single sitting. <a href=/Built-to-Sell rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Built-to-Sell>Built to Sell</a></p></li><li><p>The book is a business fable about an entrepreneur who wanted to sell a company that wasn&rsquo;t worth anything and his journey to change things.   </p></li><li><p>Ashley read the book, wrote a list of things she thought she was good at, and the next morning picked one.  This was the birth of
<a href=https://prowessproject.com/ rel=noopener>Prowess</a>. </p></li><li><p>It started with an idea about meetings.  Often times meeting wrap ups with action items and notes are not handled properly. </p></li><li><p>What if they could do a sort of Uber for meetings and have people pay for a meeting facilitator? </p></li><li><p>Ashley had lunch with a friend from middle school who was running an accelerator program. </p></li><li><p>Ashley applied the next day and was accepted to
<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/school/the-founder-institute/ rel=noopener>Founder Institute</a>, which takes you from idea to Incorporated in 4 months. <a href=/Founder-Institute rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Founder-Institute>Founder Institute</a></p></li><li><p>The program is very challenging and is the best thing she has ever done. </p></li><li><p>An accelerator program is typically for scaling an existing business.  Founder Institute was more of an incubator (idea to reality). </p></li><li><p>Regarding the list Ashley made, it was about 9 things she felt were her strengths. </p></li><li><p>This was right after the A10 breakup. </p></li><li><p>The number one thing on the list was note taking.  She is very good at making sure things get accomplished at work. </p></li><li><p>As Ashley later learned, meeting facilitation in small snippets is more of a discomfort and not a pain.  People pay to get rid of pain and not discomfort. </p></li><li><p>In addition, her heart was with women returning to work.  She was, at the time, in her early 30s and married but did not yet have children. </p></li><li><p>Throughout her career, she had an ongoing anxiety about how having children would affect her career progression. </p></li><li><p>According to Harvard Business Review, if a woman is out of the workforce to raise children for 3 years, she loses 30% of her potential compensation that can never be made up. </p></li><li><p>Ashley became obsessed with this statistic.  How could women not have both? </p></li><li><p>The meeting facilitation idea would allow training women to do this wherever they were located. </p></li><li><p>However, the two real things people needed were additional project management and more empathy. </p></li><li><p>Prowess helps the women who took time off from the workforce.  They get training that leads to a certification.   </p></li><li><p>Half the curriculum includes confidence, goal setting, emotional intelligence, and communication. </p></li><li><p>The other half is on working remotely, business trends, technology training, and project management. </p></li><li><p>At the end, a candidate takes a test to be counted in or out of the Prowess job pool. </p></li><li><p>During the process, the Prowess team gathers 52 different work style indicators on the candidates and their work. </p></li><li><p>Getting to this point was all about responded to feedback. </p></li><li><p>Ashley&rsquo;s experience was as a hiring manager, someone who would use a member of the Prowess community to help their business. </p></li><li><p>This was key in not getting overly passionate about the mission and not concentrate too much on talent development. </p></li><li><p>Initially Ashley went and spoke to hundreds of women returning to the workforce. </p></li><li><p>About 43% of women leave the workforce to raise children at some point. </p></li><li><p>There was not a clear path for these women to return (no step-by-step process), making them feel overwhelmed and intimidated. </p></li><li><p>The mix of mentorship, training, and community seems to be the secret sauce.  All of the lessons Ashley learned from Spiceworks are being applied to her current company. </p></li></ul><a href=#1713---being-ceo-of-prowess-and-finding-her-why><h2 id=1713---being-ceo-of-prowess-and-finding-her-why><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>17:13 - Being CEO of Prowess and Finding Her Why </h2></a><ul><li><p>They have been around for less than 2 years and have about 7 employees and 40 customers.  The pool of talent is about 250 women. </p></li><li><p>It was important to balance the talent with the opportunities for Prowess.  They make money through placements and matching companies with talent.  They can be more selective. </p></li><li><p>There is an application process for candidates.  Certain requirements apply to join the community.  The certifications mentioned are a requirement as well. </p></li><li><p>During COVID, Prowess created a pay it forward program so that once a candidate gets a job, they pay for another person to go through the program. </p></li><li><p>This is fostering an ambassador program as well. </p></li><li><p>21:20 - Thinking Like CEO </p></li><li><p>The way to get there is talking to your team.  Truly understand their desires, dreams, what their family is like, and their personal goals. </p></li><li><p>Ashley runs the business not for herself but for her employees. </p></li><li><p>She surrounds herself with smart people and enables them to use their talents to move the company forward. </p></li><li><p>Is she still in the Built to Sell Mindset? </p></li><li><p>No.  She has a 10-year plan for the company. </p></li><li><p>Ashley built an organization to solve her future problem (being a woman who wanted to have children someday). </p></li><li><p>Interviews, sourcing, and feedback take an amazing amount of time.  Prowess can help cut down this time commitment for organizations because of their rigorous process. </p></li><li><p>Ashley gives an example of how a prospective employer could get help from Prowess and get candidate recommendations for a specific role quickly. </p></li><li><p>How do you progress the people? </p></li><li><p>Ashley wants to build out more resources to bring emotional intelligence into the workforce.  This is where many people shine, but this is dulled down or absent in a typical hiring process until you talk to them. </p></li><li><p>Hiring is moving to the next step, and Ashley wants Prowess to be at the forefront. </p></li><li><p>To own your own business, you must be obsessed with whatever it is you are doing. </p></li><li><p>That was one of Ashley&rsquo;s problems with A10 (was not obsessed with Marketing).  With Prowess, Ashley has found her why. </p></li><li><p>Entrepreneurship is extremely hard, perhaps even more than being in Sales. </p></li><li><p>Obsession with solving the problem is the only way to keep going. </p></li><li><p>The process is tiring yet rewarding. </p></li><li><p>Finding balance </p></li></ul><p>*  Ashley has her employees write down what they want and what they don&rsquo;t want.  It is often easier to write down what you don&rsquo;t want to paint the picture backward. </p><ul><li><p>After painting the picture, it&rsquo;s important someone hold you accountable. </p></li><li><p>Taking time off is certainly important here. </p></li><li><p>The conversation may be over for now, but we certainly want to have Ashley back at some point! </p></li></ul><h2 id=contact-ushttpstwittercomnerdjourney-if-you-need-help-on-the-journey><a href=https://twitter.com/NerdJourney rel=noopener>Contact us</a> if you need help on the journey.</h2></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://graph.nerd-journey.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by John White and Nick Korte using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://graph.nerd-journey.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/NerdJourney>Twitter</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
