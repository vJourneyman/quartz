<a href=https://cloud.google.com/apigee rel=noopener>Apigee</a>). </p></li><li><p>John has assimilated to
<a href=https://workspace.google.com rel=noopener>G Suite</a> after initially being hesitant about a move away from Office 365.  He does, however, miss Visio. </p></li><li><p>In roles like this, an Engineer is assigned from a compensation standpoint to the <a href=/Sales-Quota rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Sales-Quota>quota</a> of a territory which is the same as one or more account representatives. </p></li><li><p>The Engineer is there to act as a technical resource without regard to Sales attainment (compensated differently from a Sales rep).  John shares some minor differences in percentages of variable compensation. </p></li><li><p>Quotas at <a href=/Google-Cloud rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Google-Cloud>Google Cloud</a> are very different.  John&rsquo;s quota is aligned with his manager&rsquo;s quota (as are all members of the team), which means there is no disincentive to helping someone else on the team (no variable compensation misalignment among team members).  </p></li><li><p>This model promotes collaboration, and it made John feel freer to ask for help. </p></li><li><p>John mentioned in some models, a manager&rsquo;s compensation could be aligned with an Engineer helping a teammate, but that is not the case for the specific Engineer. </p></li><li><p>The VMware portfolio was always growing and seemed to have expanded to over what someone could expect to know at a 200 level across the board. </p></li><li><p>At <a href=/Google-Cloud rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Google-Cloud>Google Cloud</a> it may be larger than that already.  To be able to demo every product in the portfolio is probably expecting too much.  John gives the examples of Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Data Lakes, and Data Warehousing as areas that were pretty new to him. </p></li><li><p>There are 8 different database engines to understand (type of storage, use case, etc.). </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s tough to compare.  The depth of knowledge required to gain proficiency / excellence in each area is a steeper climb at <a href=/Google-Cloud rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Google-Cloud>Google Cloud</a>. </p></li><li><p>When he first started at <a href=/Google-Cloud rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Google-Cloud>Google Cloud</a>, John had moved from a 100% field role at VMware to working in an office each day. </p></li><li><p>Previously, he had the luxury of visiting the VMware office here and there (maybe once per week), but at Google his commute became 40-50 minutes daily. </p></li><li><p>The benefits were getting face to face with colleagues, which encouraged camaraderie and collaboration.  With the need to work completely from home for now, John misses these benefits (especially eating meals together and just talking with others). </p></li></ul><a href=#2419---industry-experience-without-organizational-knowledge><h2 id=2419---industry-experience-without-organizational-knowledge><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>24:19 - Industry Experience without Organizational Knowledge </h2></a><ul><li>The <a href=/Ramp-Time rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Ramp-Time>Ramp Time</a> to really understanding the <a href=/Google-Cloud rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Google-Cloud>Google Cloud</a> organization and its processes took longer than John thought. </li></ul><p>*  Structures and roles </p><ul><li><p>It was difficult to learn which teams do what and when to call them in.  It takes time to understand.   </p></li><li><p>The Solution Architect role, for example, is more code driven and usually has some kind of product overlay focus (working on product integration, much like a Product Manager at VMware). </p></li><li><p>Google has an Enterprise Cloud Architect role with a very subtle difference from a Customer Engineer. </p></li><li><p>The need to be humble was extremely important as John had to repeatedly ask for guidance from others. </p></li><li><p>He&rsquo;s documented the rules of engagement to provide for others joining the <a href=/Google-Cloud rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Google-Cloud>Google Cloud</a> organization to help them ramp quicker. </p></li><li><p>With enough iterative work here, maybe this document could be something presented to people during orientation. </p></li><li><p>New types of positions within the company are constantly being created (a Solution Manager, for example), adding to the list of things to know. </p></li><li><p>A different customer base </p></li><li><p>There seem to be many more cloud native customers in the Google customer mix.  It&rsquo;s quite different from what John saw at VMware.  Some of these companies were born in the cloud (i.e. never bought physical servers, etc.).   </p></li><li><p>Many customers are greenfield (not current <a href=/Google-Cloud rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Google-Cloud>Google Cloud</a> customers).  At VMware, John worked with existing customers throughout his tenure and managing their growth. </p></li><li><p>Some customers may have existing relationships with Amazon or Microsoft as it relates to cloud technologies, but Google Ads may be the only relationship the customer has today with Google. </p></li><li><p>John has to help his customers understand Google&rsquo;s capabilities and that they are more than just a search company or a company that develops Android. </p></li><li><p>This working with greenfield customers is a muscle that someone in Pre-Sales should practice exercising (i.e. talking to customers about a new line of business your company has is along the same lines). </p></li><li><p>The segment of healthcare </p></li><li><p>At VMware this was a specific vertical segment for healthcare.  John is sort of working in the vertical but not in the actual vertical.  John&rsquo;s manager does not focus only on managing Engineers in the healthcare and life science space, for example. </p></li><li><p>The learnings from the healthcare and life science vertical can still be applied as a help in this customer set. </p></li><li><p>Learning the healthcare industry, buying patterns, motivations, etc. was very new for John.  With 80% of his customers being in this industry, he is required to bring an opinionated stance on how to use Google&rsquo;s technology in the space.  This is a tremendous growth opportunity. </p></li><li><p>A new product portfolio </p></li><li><p>John was nervous about this at first.  It has taken a year to get his head around it. </p></li><li><p>It was extremely important to remain humble.  In the first 12 weeks, an architecture certification was required, but John was given focused time to train for it. </p></li><li><p>Each product has a certain depth of complexity. </p></li><li><p>See
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/nerd-journey-023-johns-3-year-check-in-at-vmware-part-1/ rel=noopener>Episode 23</a> from John&rsquo;s 3-year check-in at VMware. He mentioned it took a year to get competent in the job, and then he had to work to get proficient. </p></li><li><p>It took the same amount of time at Google with the same methodology. </p></li><li><p>John had to be ok with being humble and unafraid of asking questions in front of peers. </p></li><li><p>He offers new hires the opportunity to ask him questions as they ramp in a safe space. </p></li><li><p>Can someone get a job at a technology company without knowing the portfolio? </p></li><li><p>John thinks the best bet is either 1) deep domain knowledge of the technology (implement, sell, or maintain the products) or 2) deep domain knowledge of the role (technical sales, product management, etc.). </p></li><li><p>In the Pre-Sales field, there is a talent shortage.  Many companies will look to recruit from colleges and train graduates to become technical sales professionals.  This helps build the talent pool. </p></li><li><p>John&rsquo;s father was in technical sales at Eastman Kodak many years ago.  Even then, John did not know the role existed or exactly what it was. </p></li><li><p>If there is another way we left out, please let us know!  We want to hear the story. </p></li></ul><a href=#4947---some-parting-career-tips><h2 id=4947---some-parting-career-tips><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>49:47 - Some Parting Career Tips </h2></a><ul><li><p>For those trying to break into Pre-Sales… </p></li><li><p>Identify what you want to do early on.  Be open to nontraditional roles.  Listen to podcasts on pre-Sales technical engineering. </p></li><li><p>We had
