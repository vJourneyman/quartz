TimeÂ for Something NewÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>How can weÂ determineÂ when it might beÂ timeÂ to go and do something new?Â </p></li><li><p>Sit back and gain perspectiveÂ on your level of happiness.Â  Happiness drives much of theÂ decision making weÂ do.Â Â </p></li><li><p>Whether you areÂ mentally curious andÂ emotionally fulfilled contributes to how weÂ view our professional roles and functions.Â  As much as weÂ want to separateÂ personal and professional life, peopleÂ do not always appreciateÂ how much our professional careers contributeÂ toÂ emotional fulfillment.Â </p></li><li><p>If you do not feel fulfilled, it can spill over and affect your family or your attitudeÂ toward your work.Â </p></li><li><p>When you&rsquo;reÂ curious about something different or frustrated about what you areÂ doing, thoseÂ areÂ thereÂ times to consider an opportunity to do something different.Â Â </p></li><li><p>Consider theÂ skills you haveÂ and thoseÂ you want to learn.Â  Is thereÂ a placeÂ within your company that would leverageÂ what you bring to theÂ tableÂ and haveÂ a need for someoneÂ likeÂ yourself to go into theÂ role.Â </p></li><li><p>In Joe&rsquo;sÂ experience, personal relationships (building and maintaining them) haveÂ played a largeÂ part in being presented with theÂ next opportunity.Â  Many times a conversation with someoneÂ heÂ onceÂ worked with presented him with a new opportunity.Â </p></li><li><p>WeÂ should keep thoseÂ personal connections warm.Â  Maintaining relationships takesÂ effort and must beÂ directional.Â </p></li><li><p>If we&rsquo;reÂ relating to peopleÂ weÂ work with, thereÂ areÂ many circumstances whereÂ weÂ build relationships with peopleÂ who really stuck out for oneÂ reason or another.Â  It&rsquo;s thoseÂ peopleÂ you really want to curateÂ throughout your career (i.e. check in and seeÂ how they areÂ doing).Â  ThoseÂ relationships will often times act as bridges to something new and unique.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>This is about caring for people.Â  TheÂ bonds haveÂ a tendency to beÂ fruitful by providing new insight in conversation.Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ has mentors he&rsquo;s leveraged for discussing ideas, anxieties, and frustrations.Â  If weÂ can do this throughout our career (however long itÂ ends up being),Â even peopleÂ weÂ haven&rsquo;t worked with in a very long timeÂ will remember you for theÂ positivity you brought.Â  They will still beÂ thereÂ and could beÂ theÂ very ones who lead you into a new opportunity.Â </p></li><li><p>WeÂ liveÂ in a world that is very small in technology.Â  ContinueÂ to curateÂ theÂ relationships that you can leverageÂ when you&rsquo;reÂ ready to do something moreÂ than you areÂ doing today.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#913---thementors-role><h2 id=913---thementors-role><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>9:13 - TheÂ Mentor&rsquo;s RoleÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>SomeÂ of Joe&rsquo;s mentors wereÂ previous front lineÂ managers heÂ worked under which heÂ continued to useÂ as mentors (bouncing ideas, asking about areas of theÂ company).Â </p></li><li><p>Mentors can provideÂ a perspectiveÂ that you don&rsquo;t have.Â  They can seeÂ theÂ good we&rsquo;reÂ doing which weÂ do not seeÂ ourselves and provideÂ transparent feedback into areas whereÂ weÂ need to grow which weÂ may not beÂ thinking of.Â </p></li><li><p>Mentoring does not always haveÂ to beÂ formal as to what theÂ relationships look like.Â  SomeÂ of Joe&rsquo;s mentors haveÂ been peers, and someÂ haveÂ been leaders.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>It depends on your focus as an individual.Â  Sometimes good mentors can beÂ thoseÂ who areÂ doing things weÂ areÂ interested in doing.Â  ThereÂ areÂ also folks who haveÂ been successful in career progression that weÂ might useÂ as a sounding board for our own career progression.Â </p></li><li><p>Mentors can help us think through career decisions as well as beÂ narrowly focused on helping us build a specific skill that will unlock new opportunities for us.Â </p></li><li><p>Mentors can also guideÂ us in how to haveÂ career conversations with our manager.Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s oftenÂ easier to haveÂ that conversation with mentors instead of your front lineÂ manager.Â  They can help you approach it theÂ right way.Â </p></li><li><p>Whatever a mentor shares as far as how they did something, takeÂ it with a grain of salt becauseÂ thatÂ experienceÂ was uniqueÂ to them.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ often tells mentees, &ldquo;in your situation, you may consider X, Y, Z.&rdquo;Â  And when sharing hisÂ experience, heÂ makes sureÂ to communicateÂ it was theÂ path heÂ choseÂ based on his circumstances.Â  TheÂ suggestions heÂ provides mentees is meant to let theÂ person think through what will beÂ most comfortableÂ to them.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ mentor can act as a sounding board that decreases anxiety.Â  There&rsquo;s no pressureÂ on them and noneÂ on you.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#1337---reacting-to-feedback><h2 id=1337---reacting-to-feedback><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>13:37 - Reacting to FeedbackÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>What if theÂ boss is not receptiveÂ to what you want (i.e. a promotion / specific roleÂ on theÂ team)Â even after practicing with a mentor?Â </p></li><li><p>It largely depends on how satisfied you areÂ in what you areÂ doing today.Â </p></li><li><p>Keep in mind theÂ manager you areÂ speaking to is a human being.Â  This has taken JoeÂ years to learn.Â </p></li><li><p>Trying to understand your manager&rsquo;s perspectiveÂ a littleÂ better also helps.Â  When theÂ answer you wanted to hear does not comeÂ to you, this might allow you to takeÂ theÂ answer differently.Â </p></li><li><p>If you&rsquo;reÂ not satisfied with theÂ feedback from a conversation with theÂ boss, it is timeÂ to assess your situation.Â  Ask yourselfâ€¦Â </p></li><li><p>Do I need to build additional skills?Â  (a great follow up question for theÂ boss)Â </p></li><li><p>If theÂ opportunity does not present itself now, when do weÂ anticipateÂ it coming up? (another good question to ask)Â </p></li><li><p>You also haveÂ theÂ option to pauseÂ theÂ conversation with your manager, do your own assessment, and talk to a coach or a mentor to reflect.Â </p></li><li><p>Perhaps theÂ answer is that theÂ opportunity is not thereÂ in your current team / role, and now may beÂ theÂ timeÂ to transition.Â </p></li><li><p>You could ask your boss what theÂ gaps are.Â  Perhaps you and a mentor did not seeÂ them as theÂ boss does.Â </p></li><li><p>In many cases JoeÂ likes to useÂ mentors outsideÂ of his organization within theÂ company.Â </p></li><li><p>They haveÂ a different perspective.Â </p></li><li><p>ThereÂ areÂ not necessarily privy to what you do on a daily basis likeÂ your direct manager, peer, or skip level manager might.Â </p></li><li><p>Taking input from multipleÂ viewpoints is helpful,Â especially when we&rsquo;reÂ looking to transition to a roleÂ different from theÂ oneÂ weÂ areÂ in now. Having multipleÂ voices can help us makeÂ a decision.Â </p></li><li><p>OnceÂ you comeÂ to a conclusion on theÂ next progression step for you, if it does notÂ exist within your organization, go and haveÂ that conversation with your manager about helping you find what you want within theÂ company.Â </p></li><li><p>No oneÂ should haveÂ theÂ expectation you will do theÂ sameÂ thing you do now for 20 years.Â </p></li><li><p>Being ready to haveÂ that conversation isÂ easier onceÂ weÂ haveÂ determined how far weÂ can takeÂ ourselves in our current job codeÂ / job family.Â Â </p></li><li><p>It can beÂ difficult,Â especially when weÂ likeÂ theÂ company and theÂ peopleÂ who work with us. It becomes a choiceÂ between stay within theÂ company or go to a placeÂ that has theÂ opportunity you want.Â </p></li><li><p>It all goes back to how satisfied you areÂ in what you do when it&rsquo;s timeÂ to makeÂ a decision.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#1805---layers-of-management><h2 id=1805---layers-of-management><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>18:05 - Layers of ManagementÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>JoeÂ has considered peopleÂ leadership previously both at VMwareÂ and at his previousÂ employers.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>It cameÂ down to satisfaction with what heÂ was doing.Â </p></li><li><p>When heÂ looked at peopleÂ managementÂ earlier in his career, heÂ looked at it as a natural progression step (a misinformed opinion).Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>After researching specific roles in peopleÂ management and understood theÂ characteristics theÂ company was looking for, they did not align with Joe&rsquo;s passion areas.Â </p></li><li><p>When you&rsquo;reÂ not passionateÂ about something you don&rsquo;t necessarily put your best foot forward.Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ was not passionateÂ about having to manageÂ cost centers and other administrativeÂ tasks.Â </p></li><li><p>Your level ofÂ enthusiasm for theÂ work at hand portends how successful you can beÂ when you want to interview for that typeÂ of role.Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ found heÂ was moreÂ enthusiastic about theÂ technology than anythingÂ elseÂ and found peopleÂ management to not beÂ for him at that time.Â </p></li><li><p>Staying an individual contributor allowed JoeÂ to control his area of focus within technology and theÂ types of things heÂ focused on without taking on theÂ burden to think about salaries and career progression of direct reports (and other daily duties of a manager).Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ sees himself as a hard coreÂ technology, and that is whereÂ his interest is.Â Â </p></li><li><p>Over timeÂ your view point on staying individual contributor or pursuing leadership can shift.Â </p></li><li><p>Do you still feel passionateÂ about theÂ technology?Â </p></li><li><p>AreÂ you looking to build other peopleÂ up?Â </p></li><li><p>PeopleÂ who step into management roles areÂ looking to build and curateÂ people?Â </p></li><li><p>Over timeÂ JoeÂ has focused moreÂ on mentorship and coaching.Â  His mind is moreÂ receptiveÂ toÂ eventually taking a management roleÂ becauseÂ heÂ is looking at being moreÂ of a coach and mentor as opposed to theÂ person doing theÂ actual work.Â </p></li><li><p>It goes

Managing Programs and ProjectsÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Program and project management is a career field in an of itself, which includes managing an organization madeÂ up of resources and assets in order to accomplish building something.Â </p></li><li><p>Program managers and project managers areÂ facilitating schedules, resources, and assets to createÂ a deliverableÂ (a building, an IT project,Â etc.).Â  TheseÂ peopleÂ areÂ not managers themselves but haveÂ to manageÂ resources and assets.Â </p></li><li><p>OneÂ of theÂ resources happens to beÂ humans (engineering talent, operational talent,Â etc.).Â  You get into influencing theÂ work of other peopleÂ and scheduling theÂ resources, working with managers,Â etc.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ focus is on theÂ level of work and theÂ typeÂ of work without theÂ responsibility for managing individual career paths.Â </p></li><li><p>ThereÂ is a fineÂ lineÂ becauseÂ theÂ resources whoseÂ work you need to manageÂ do not report to you, and influencing must beÂ doneÂ indirectly and in various ways.Â </p></li><li><p>Matrix management is often what program manager and project managers do (trying to get human resources to do something / build something on behalf of theÂ company).Â </p></li><li><p>In many cases, weÂ as technologists need someoneÂ to organizeÂ work into finiteÂ tasks to accomplish on a schedule.Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ got into roles likeÂ this to do something different than just technical implementation.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ was bored at theÂ timeÂ and had taken someÂ program management training whileÂ in theÂ Air Force, feeling it was something heÂ could utilize.Â Â </p></li><li><p>That training taught him how to influenceÂ people.Â  When heÂ was in a program management roleÂ heÂ had to control costs, schedules, and theÂ quality of theÂ work whileÂ not necessarily having authoritativeÂ control over any of thoseÂ things.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ skills JoeÂ learned from this typeÂ of roleÂ wereÂ very helpful, but theÂ roleÂ itself was also a frustration point that contributed to his later transition back to a roleÂ focused on technical architecture.Â </p></li><li><p>If you work for a small company and areÂ highly organized, changes areÂ you haveÂ doneÂ project management typeÂ tasks withoutÂ even realizing it.Â </p></li><li><p>MaybeÂ this is an adjacency that could beÂ an option for you if looking to do something different.Â </p></li><li><p>Project and program management areÂ career fields in and of themselves regardless of whether it applies to IT.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ sameÂ methodology a project manager in construction applies in IT and many other industries as well.Â </p></li><li><p>This is theÂ great thing about learning new skill sets and soft skills (project management, financial management,Â etc.) as they can lead to new opportunities insideÂ your company or outside.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#2911---theway-of-theprincipal><h2 id=2911---theway-of-theprincipal><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>29:11 - TheÂ Way of theÂ PrincipalÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>TheÂ principal titleÂ is highly regarded and somewhatÂ eliteÂ across our industry for individual contributors.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ principal titleÂ can mean different things depending upon theÂ company.Â  Largely it is consistent with oneÂ of theÂ higher tier technologist roles across our industry.Â </p></li><li><p>In many respects achieving theÂ principal status requires specialization in a context that you&rsquo;reÂ building your platform and becoming known for something uniqueÂ and differentiated as opposed to theÂ majority of your colleagues.Â </p></li><li><p>Taking pre-sales solutionÂ engineering as anÂ example, thereÂ areÂ many potential areas of focus.Â  To go to theÂ principal level, it becomes a matter of becoming known for a certain technical skill set or body of work.Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ started to build a specialization when heÂ joined theÂ Dell synergy part of theÂ organization and becoming anÂ expert in joint Dell and VMwareÂ solutions.Â  HeÂ also started building relationships within theÂ OfficeÂ of theÂ CTO whileÂ serving as a CTO Ambassador.Â </p></li><li><p>This led JoeÂ to wonder if heÂ was ready to takeÂ theÂ next step and go for principal.Â </p></li><li><p>In many companies thereÂ is a structured process to get to that level.Â </p></li><li><p>OnceÂ again it was up to JoeÂ to signal what heÂ wanted to do and then find a coach who could help meÂ think through theÂ necessary steps to prepareÂ to go through theÂ process.Â </p></li><li><p>Graduating from a generalist to becoming a specialist is pretty much required as it takes a finiteÂ focus to really build up your credibility.Â  Joe, forÂ example, has a tendency to beÂ brought in to discuss joint solution sets.Â </p></li><li><p>Looking at other field principals heÂ knows, JoeÂ mentionsÂ each oneÂ has built up their skillset and becomeÂ known in and for a specific thing / area.Â </p></li><li><p>Regardless of your company, theÂ principal titleÂ is for a very differentiated skill set for a uniqueÂ area whereÂ theÂ company is focused.Â </p></li><li><p>It can comeÂ down to technical depth and building a broad swath of soft skills as part of a greater body of work.Â  It&rsquo;s almost likeÂ explaining to someoneÂ elseÂ how you&rsquo;veÂ attained that level and why you deserveÂ that distinction.Â </p></li><li><p>It took JoeÂ a whileÂ to understand what theÂ process was to get to theÂ principal level.Â  HeÂ had to beÂ curious about it first.Â Â </p></li><li><p>DefineÂ a specialization, and work to makeÂ yourself known for it.Â </p></li><li><p>Is theÂ road to principal paved withÂ even moreÂ work than you&rsquo;reÂ doing now?Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>It comes down to timeÂ management.Â  If thereÂ is something you want to do you will find timeÂ to do it.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>In many cases when JoeÂ choseÂ to go down theÂ principal path heÂ had to figureÂ out how to find theÂ timeÂ for it.Â  JoeÂ tried to align preparation for principal with his daily work.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ moreÂ thoseÂ two things align theÂ easier it will beÂ for you to makeÂ that progression.Â </p></li><li><p>You will need moreÂ timeÂ than 40 hours per week.Â  JoeÂ had to dedicateÂ someÂ personal timeÂ to his principal preparation.Â </p></li><li><p>For theÂ period of timeÂ heÂ was going through preparation for principal, it did takeÂ away from Joe&rsquo;s family time.Â </p></li><li><p>PeopleÂ looking at career progression during a promotion phaseÂ areÂ likely going to haveÂ to put forthÂ extraÂ effort which has to beÂ balanced with your personal needs as well as thoseÂ of your family.Â </p></li><li><p>BeÂ prepared to find timeÂ outsideÂ of your day job to makeÂ that progression happen.Â  MaybeÂ it&rsquo;s ok to flex yourself for a littleÂ whileÂ and then takeÂ someÂ timeÂ off.Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ had someÂ early conversations with his management chain about his participation in theÂ global field program, which provided him someÂ air cover.Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ had relayed theÂ benefits of his participation in this program to his team and his management (theÂ internal organization heÂ worked within).Â </p></li><li><p>If you&rsquo;reÂ looking at a promotion (whether principal or not), your ability toÂ explain why it is beneficial to your organization that you work toward that promotion really helps provideÂ theÂ justification for spending theÂ timeÂ and reserving someÂ of your day hours for it.Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ had to sell it to his management, and they wereÂ supportiveÂ of theÂ timeÂ heÂ needed.Â </p></li><li><p>WeÂ haveÂ to beÂ known and distinguished for something.Â  JoeÂ spent timeÂ gainingÂ expertiseÂ in theÂ Dell solution set so that if someoneÂ insideÂ theÂ OfficeÂ of theÂ CTO needed a resourceÂ to speak on joint Dell and VMwareÂ solutions they would automatically think of him.Â </p></li><li><p>This takes a lot of work and time.Â  It takes gaining visibility within your organization as well so that someoneÂ will associateÂ expertiseÂ in a specific area with you.Â </p></li><li><p>And onceÂ they do associateÂ theÂ two, seeing that you haveÂ theÂ ability to go very deep in oneÂ area, new opportunities may present themselves to repeat that level of depth in another area.Â </p></li></ul><a

NextÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>TheÂ higher you go into your career (i.e. further up theÂ career ladder as an individual contributor), thereÂ is a lot of focus at theÂ highest levels on building up others.Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ does not think heÂ would haveÂ progressed to his current level without peopleÂ who wereÂ ableÂ to coach him along theÂ way (others who had walked theÂ sameÂ progression path to principal).Â </p></li><li><p>Joe&rsquo;s curiosity led to him asking questions and getting feedback on what heÂ could do to fill theÂ gaps.Â </p></li><li><p>Now heÂ spends timeÂ coaching peopleÂ 1-1 who seek to follow theÂ sameÂ path, providing suggestions on theÂ mindset shift that must happen in taking theÂ next steps.Â </p></li><li><p>It becomes curating and fostering mindsets day in and day out for customers, partners, product teams, and thoseÂ moreÂ junior than yourself within theÂ company.Â </p></li><li><p>What&rsquo;s next for JoeÂ Chenevey?Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ has to haveÂ periods of timeÂ for reflection throughout theÂ year.Â Â EveryoneÂ should consider taking timeÂ just for this to determineÂ mental health,Â emotional health, and what weÂ feel about our work / lifeÂ balance.Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s challenging in technology to frameÂ work lifeÂ balance.Â  JoeÂ derives a lot ofÂ emotional fulfillment from what heÂ does daily as a professional in theÂ industry.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>JoeÂ feels when in theÂ modeÂ of personal reflection, it gives him a good perspectiveÂ on overall job satisfaction.Â </p></li><li><p>Am I happy doing what I am doing?Â </p></li><li><p>Do I likeÂ what I do?Â </p></li><li><p>Am I ready for something different?Â </p></li><li><p>Am I ready for theÂ next step (whatever that is)?Â </p></li><li><p>After asking himself questions likeÂ theÂ ones above, JoeÂ will seek a sounding board (a coach or mentor) and at someÂ point communicating to his leadership.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ technologist must constantlyÂ evaluateÂ whereÂ they fit in theÂ industry, and theseÂ periods of reflection allow JoeÂ to do just that.Â </p></li><li><p>You can follow JoeÂ on Twitter
