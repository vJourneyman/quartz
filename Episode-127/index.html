Grinding Away to NothingÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>It is very easy for people to just keep going.Â  We canâ€™t see ourselves when we&rsquo;re going too far.Â </p></li><li><p>If you set a goal for yourself to write 1000 words per day for 30 days, you will have written 30,000 words in a month.Â  That&rsquo;s a book.Â  It&rsquo;s important not to write 10,000 words on day 1 and leave yourself with nothing else to do.Â </p></li><li><p>Set manageable, achievable goals for consistency&rsquo;s sake.Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s very easy when working out, for example, to decide to do just a little more.Â </p></li><li><p>There is nothing wrong with doing your workout each day or even stopping short of a distance goal.Â </p></li><li><p>If you don&rsquo;t set a goal with an achievable end, you will always push yourself past it.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Pushing farther than the finish line works in the short term, but beware grinding away to nothing.Â </p></li><li><p>Hit the target and feel accomplished.Â  Reward yourself with some downtime.Â </p></li><li><p>What would happen if you just kept increasing the distance you ran each day but eventually reached the point where your body needed to rest?Â </p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s easy to set goals that are constantly escalating.Â  Eventually you will hit the point of &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this anymore.&rdquo;Â </p></li><li><p>Then you don&rsquo;t stop and reflect.Â  You stop and chastise yourself for missing the mark.Â </p></li><li><p>We do not stop and examine what we have been doing.Â </p></li><li><p>A stretch goal should be like a rubber band.Â  Stretch it every once in a while but not to the point of breaking the rubber band.Â </p></li><li><p>Pick a day here and there to work on the stretch goal.Â </p></li><li><p>Do it often enough that it feels like a special occasion and pushes you past boundaries but not so often that it adds stress.Â </p></li><li><p>Tom liked writing blog posts, but when he had to write 8 per week he did not love it as much as he used to.Â </p></li><li><p>Work is the thing you do all the time that doesn&rsquo;t feel fun anymore.Â </p></li><li><p>You have to find little ways to keep the work fun.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#3036---whats-next-and-closing-thoughts><h2 id=3036---whats-next-and-closing-thoughts><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>30:36 - What&rsquo;s Next and Closing ThoughtsÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>One of the nice things about technology is that it changes so much.Â </p></li><li><p>How different would his career have been if he had a phone at the beginning to look up information?Â </p></li><li><p>The jobs he used to do really don&rsquo;t exist any longer.Â  Tom can whine about things that no longer exist or look for things that now interest him.Â </p></li><li><p>If he does the latter he can eliminate what does not interest him (like being a storage analyst).Â </p></li><li><p>As hard as saying no is, fear of missing out is even harder.Â  We need to say no and be ok with not being a part of something and not dwell on it.Â Â </p></li><li><p>Listen to Tom&rsquo;s story about the time he went repelling and how he decided it was not for him.Â Â </p></li><li><p>If you have a visceral reaction to something long enough, that is your brain trying to tell you to stop doing that thing.Â </p></li><li><p>The best career advice Tom ever got was when someone told him he needed to always be in a mode where he was learning things.Â </p></li><li><p>If you are not someone who wants to crack open a book, investigate a technology, or dig deeper into something you will have a rough time in the tech industry.Â  If you have learned all there is to know, you will find yourself obsolete very fast.Â </p></li><li><p>The worst career advice was &ldquo;it&rsquo;s magic.Â  It will figure itself out.&rdquo;Â </p></li><li><p>Nothing is magic!Â  Magic happens because dedicated people put their effort into making things work.Â  It may look like magic to you because you didn&rsquo;t do it.Â </p></li><li><p>Understand that all magic is just other people working really hard to make something special happens.Â </p></li><li><p>Nick tosses out some of John White&rsquo;s previous advice.Â </p></li><li><p>Successful people are not super successful.Â  They are just really good at picking themselves up after every failure, and they are stubborn.Â </p></li><li><p>If you know you can get something, keep working at it.Â  Eventually it will look like magic.Â </p></li><li><p>The magic isn&rsquo;t pulling the rabbit out of the hat.Â  It&rsquo;s doing the work to put the rabbit in the hat in the first place and carrying it carefully so the rabbit doesn&rsquo;t hop out.Â </p></li><li><p>The easiest way to follow up with Tom is on Twitter.Â  His handle is
