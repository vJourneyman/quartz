<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95 rel=noopener>Windows 95</a>).Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>After playing a lot of Nascar heÂ got introduced to
<a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Mario_Teaches_Typing_1992 rel=noopener>Mario Teaches Typing</a>Â </p></li><li><p>After tinkering with this Bill began to do someÂ basic web design uponÂ entering high school.Â  Part of his study hall period was normally spent tinkering on a computer in theÂ classroom.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill was ableÂ to talk his aunt into buying him a book on how to build computers.Â  HeÂ later saved someÂ paper routeÂ money and leveraged it to buy someÂ computer parts and build his own PC.Â </p></li><li><p>PeopleÂ started paying Bill to takeÂ viruses off their computers onceÂ they knew heÂ was capable.Â  Getting $30 or $40 is a lot to a teenager, and theÂ money heÂ madeÂ generally was used as gas money.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill&rsquo;s family suggested heÂ go to school to study computers.Â  A guidanceÂ counselorÂ encouraged him to tour a tradeÂ school in theÂ area, and heÂ did that for his last 2 years of high school, studying information studying computer information systems and computer networking.Â </p></li><li><p>It cameÂ prettyÂ easy to Bill, and heÂ did better thereÂ than at his high school.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill later attended
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITT_Technical_Institute rel=noopener>ITT Technical Institute</a> and got his associate&rsquo;s degree.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#622---learn-a-vocation><h2 id=622---learn-a-vocation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>6:22 - Learn A VocationÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>TheÂ vocational school was a joint vocational school to learn trades whileÂ in high school.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill is a hugeÂ proponent of vocational schooling.Â  CollegeÂ may not forÂ everyone, but that does not mean you cannot learn a skill.Â  Many trades out thereÂ need skilled people, and learning a skill can help you no matter what you do in your career.Â </p></li><li><p>It was not hard for Bill to find a job or sideÂ work doing IT after high school.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>HeÂ isÂ extremely grateful for theÂ early conversations with family and theÂ guidanceÂ counselor mentioned.Â  It has not let him down yet.Â </p></li><li><p>Nick mentions RedditÂ posts about high school students not knowing what to do with their career direction, usuallyÂ encouraging them to go and getÂ experienceÂ in something.Â </p></li><li><p>Sometimes you haveÂ to do a coupleÂ of different jobs beforeÂ you figureÂ out what you don&rsquo;t want to do.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill has known folks who learned how to lay bricks and stud walls, skills heÂ wished heÂ had.Â  Bill hasÂ even considered going back to school to learn someÂ of theseÂ types of skills.Â </p></li><li><p>Getting theÂ experienceÂ through his vocational school was priceless (and a turning point) for Bill.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill recommends that any high school student check out vocational / tradeÂ schools as an option.Â </p></li><li><p>John sees technology trades closely associated with theÂ apprenticeÂ system weÂ seeÂ forÂ electricians / plumbers / carpenters, forÂ example.Â </p></li><li><p>BeforeÂ you can beÂ a masterÂ electrician you haveÂ to beÂ an apprenticeÂ and a journeyman (part of theÂ reason for John&rsquo;s Twitter handleÂ of @vJourneyman).Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>There&rsquo;s nothing really likeÂ this system in theÂ technology industry.Â </p></li><li><p>PeopleÂ don&rsquo;t realizeÂ how good of a living you can makeÂ in someÂ of theÂ trades that aren&rsquo;t as &ldquo;popular.&rdquo;Â  As a result viableÂ tradeÂ schools and specific trades may beÂ getting ignored (i.e. nurse,Â electrician, carpenter,Â etc.).Â </p></li><li><p>Bill is thankful theÂ vocationalÂ experienceÂ was there, and it started with someoneÂ telling him about it.Â </p></li><li><p>Many of theÂ things that Bill learned during school areÂ now obsoleteÂ / outdated / irrelevant.Â  That happens in IT, and Bill said heÂ had to beÂ ok with constantly learning in this industry.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#1105---constantly-learning-and-shifting><h2 id=1105---constantly-learning-and-shifting><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>11:05 - Constantly Learning and ShiftingÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>For thoseÂ with kids listening (of any age), it&rsquo;s important for all of us to beÂ mindful of what our kids areÂ interested, to help them learn about themselves, and help them learn about what they could do with theÂ skills they already have.Â </p></li><li><p>This is hitting Nick harder and harder as heÂ spends timeÂ on Reddit and continues speaking with peopleÂ on theÂ podcast.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill has felt strongly about tradeÂ schools for a long timeÂ and applying that to our industry.Â  It was refreshing for him to read BeÂ theÂ Master by Don Jones (seeÂ 
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/something-to-offer-something-to-share-with-don-jones-1-2/ rel=noopener>EpisodeÂ 137</a> and
<a href=https://nerd-journey.com/apprentice-amplifier-and-people-developer-with-don-jones-2-2/ rel=noopener>EpisodeÂ 138</a>), oneÂ of theÂ most influential heÂ has read.Â </p></li><li><p>TheÂ latest iteration of this is

Lessons Learned at WalmartÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Unfortunately for Bill, no oneÂ wanted to hireÂ an IT person straight out of high schoolÂ even with strong grades and provableÂ skills.Â  HeÂ lacked certifications.Â Â </p></li><li><p>Bill needed a job, and they wereÂ building a new Wal-Mart Supercenter near him.Â  HeÂ went to a local store, filled out a paper application, and heard nothing back (even though they wereÂ actively hiring).Â </p></li><li><p>Bill walked back in and got 25 paper applications, took them home, and filledÂ every oneÂ of them out by hand.Â  TheÂ next day heÂ dropped them off at theÂ store.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill received a call not long after this that they wanted him to comeÂ in for an interview (part of a mass hiringÂ event).Â </p></li><li><p>HeÂ ended up being interviewed by theÂ store&rsquo;s co-manager who had all 26 applications stacked together.Â  SheÂ told him for someoneÂ as young as Bill to fill out that many applications it was only fitting that sheÂ call him.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill got theÂ job and worked with theÂ lady who interviewed him for about 3 years, learning a lot about retail and peopleÂ in theÂ process.Â </p></li><li><p>Customer serviceÂ is a lost art to a lot of people.Â  Bill&rsquo;s managers drilled theÂ importanceÂ of this into theÂ employeesÂ every singleÂ day.Â  TheÂ managersÂ empowered theÂ employees to makeÂ decisions (at all levels).Â  It&rsquo;s been a rarity in Bill&rsquo;s career to haveÂ management likeÂ that.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill knew heÂ didn&rsquo;t want to stay with Wal-Mart long term.Â </p></li><li><p>HeÂ had interviewed for a management training program thereÂ but was not accepted.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill kept trying to break into Wal-Mart IT, but it didn&rsquo;t go anywhere.Â </p></li><li><p>After trying a coupleÂ of different things heÂ decided to look for greener pastures.Â </p></li><li><p>BillÂ ended up doing an internship at theÂ vocational school heÂ had attendedÂ earlier.Â </p></li><li><p>John makes theÂ observation that Bill had a vision forÂ either progressing or leaving.Â  After pursuing multipleÂ avenues that wereÂ not going to pan out, theÂ only choiceÂ was leaving.Â </p></li><li><p>ThereÂ wereÂ a few times whereÂ peopleÂ would ask Bill to setup theÂ computers heÂ sold at Wal-Mart at their homes for a littleÂ sideÂ money, which kept himÂ excited about IT and allowed a littleÂ moonlighting.Â </p></li></ul><a href=#2141---focus-on-customer-service><h2 id=2141---focus-on-customer-service><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>21:41 - Focus on Customer ServiceÂ </h2></a><ul><li><p>Most all of Bill&rsquo;s customer serviceÂ skills cameÂ from his timeÂ at Wal-Mart.Â  TheÂ managers during that timeÂ wereÂ very peopleÂ oriented and would go aboveÂ and beyond.Â Â Â </p></li><li><p>Bill tries to keep theseÂ lessons in mind when heÂ helps peopleÂ even now.Â </p></li><li><p>It would beÂ extremely beneficial for anyoneÂ in IT (regardless of your level,Â even if you areÂ just getting started) to do someÂ typeÂ of work that involves dealing with peopleÂ on a regular basis.Â </p></li><li><p>You will learn so much about people, what makes them happy, and what makes them mad.Â </p></li><li><p>This is about listening to someone&rsquo;s problem and trying to help theÂ person resolveÂ it.Â </p></li><li><p>You will learn to spot thoseÂ who genuinely want / need help and thoseÂ who need to beÂ heard.Â  You may haveÂ to beÂ theÂ person that lends anÂ ear so someoneÂ feels they areÂ being heard.Â </p></li><li><p>Bill says working retail (even for a short term) could beÂ a riteÂ of passageÂ for IT professionals becauseÂ of what you learn doing it.Â  ThereÂ areÂ not many IT jobs whereÂ you don&rsquo;t haveÂ to interact with others in someÂ way.Â </p></li><li><p>John&rsquo;s wifeÂ shared an articleÂ with him about theÂ
